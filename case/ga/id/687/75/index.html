Floyd Superior Court. Before Judge Hicks. September 9, 1958.</div><div class="casepresiding">TOWNSEND, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. A plaintiff who seeks to allege a valid and binding contract between himself and a municipality must allege sufficient facts to show that the city officials with whom he dealt had authority to contract in the manner claimed. The plaintiff having failed, on demurrer pointing out this defect, to allege such authority, allegations concerning the contractual relation between the city and the plaintiff were properly stricken.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is proper to grant a nonsuit where the plaintiff fails to prove his case as laid, or where he establishes other facts which disprove his right to recover. Accordingly, where the petition alleges that the plaintiff owned water pipes which was laid for the purpose of bringing water to certain houses, and that the city by connecting other houses with the pipe has deprived him of his use of the property, but the proof on the trial fails to show any deprivation to the plaintiff as to the use for which the pipes were placed in their present location by him, or any interference with the use for which he placed them there, the plaintiff has not proved his case as laid, and it was not error for the court to grant a nonsuit.</div><div class="casepar">Leo Russell brought an action against the City of Rome in the Superior Court of Floyd County seeking damages for certain water pipe which he alleged belonged to him and that the city had appropriated to its own use by connecting other homes thereto without his consent, thus depriving plaintiff of his property. The petition alleges that in 1948 he owned certain property outside the city limits; that he purchased water pipe and laid it from the city limits to his property at a cost of $725; that this line was connected with the water line belonging to the city, and that the acts of the city in connecting other houses to this water pipe since the intervening property was taken into the City of Rome has damaged him in the sum of $800. On the trial the plaintiff's evidence showed that there was approximately 700 feet of pipe involved, that the plaintiff purchased it from the City Public Works Department Superintendent at a cost of about $725 and the city laid the pipe; that the plaintiff's frontage consisted of approximately 241 feet and the remainder of the pipe was laid on land not belonging to him, but without showing the title of the realty on which it was laid; and that shortly after the pipe was laid the plaintiff sold the four houses comprising his 241 feet of frontage which the water pipe was connected up to serve. At the close of this evidence the court granted a non-suit. Error is assigned on this judgment and on a judgment sustaining certain special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. A demurrer to the allegation that the water line was connected up "with the consent and agreement of said city" was sustained and the petition amended to show that the agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and the superintendent of the municipal public works department, that petitioner paid the city for the pipe and for all water used in said main, and that on account of these facts the city is estopped to deny that it is not bound by the contract. Demurrers to this paragraph were sustained on the grounds that the authority of such superintendent was not set forth and that the facts alleged do not constitute an estoppel against the city. While it is recited in the brief that the trial court "took judicial notice" of the lack of authority of the city public works superintendent to enter into such a contract, and while this cannot be done, the same result is reached by noting that the plaintiff, upon whom the burden rested to allege and prove the facts necessary to his recovery, failed to allege any such authority to contract on the part of the official involved. Code  89-903 states: "Powers of all public officers are defined by law, and all persons must take notice thereof. The public may not be estopped by the acts of any officer done in the exercise of a power not conferred." Accordingly, the demurrers to paragraph 5 were properly sustained, and the allegations regarding any contractual relationship between the parties were eliminated inn their entirety.</div><div class="casepar">2. A general demurrer to the petition was overruled and no exception was taken to that judgment. It is accordingly the law of this case that the petition, the substantial allegations concerning which are set out in the statement of facts, states a cause of action, and it is also the law that, regardless of whether a petition states a cause of action or not, the plaintiff cannot be nonsuited if he proves everything alleged without at the same time disproving by other evidence his right to recover. Clark v. Bandy, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 546</span> (27 S. E. 2d 17). Code  110-310. The petition alleges that the pipe involved belongs to him because he purchased and paid for it, and that the acts of the city have "deprived him of his property." The evidence shows that the plaintiff originally owned four lots on which were located dwelling houses, that he procured city water to be run to these houses by purchasing some pipe from a city official, the city then laying the pipe and running water to the houses, which water was purchased and paid for; that shortly after the completion of this work the plaintiff sold the houses and has had nothing further to do with them, and that of the pipe laid about 240 feet is on the premises sold and the rest on territory between those premises and the former city limits. It necessarily follows that, as to that pipe which was actually on premises which the plaintiff owned and which he sold to other persons, the pipe had become a fixture of the property sold and title could not be in him so as to permit him to bring an action on account of injury or damage to it. Code (Ann.)  3-108, Code  3-109; Ford Realty &amp;c. Co. v. City of Cleveland, 30 Ohio App. 1 (164 N.E. 62); Trentman v. City and County of Denver, Col., 236 Fed. 2d 951.</div><div class="casepar">As to the pipe between the premises and the city water main, the question arises as to whether the plaintiff is suing the city for a breach of a contract of sale of this pipe to him, or whether the petition sounds in tort because of injury to his property, or to some legal right which he possessed. All allegations concerning his contract with the city having been stricken on demurrer, the petition, which under the law of the case states a cause of action, can do so only in tort because of the allegations therein that the city had appropriated the plaintiff's property and deprived him of its use. The evidence fails to show that the use for which the pipes were intended -- that is, the servicing of the four houses with water -- had in any way been diminished or interfered with, and the petition, construed as sounding in tort, thus totally fails to show any appropriation by the city resulting in deprivation to the plaintiff or even to the plaintiff's privies in estate. Having failed in this respect, the plaintiff has not proved his case as laid and the trial court did not err in granting a nonsuit.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Gardner, P.
