A physician admitted the child to the Hospital and ordered that he be placed on a pediatric apnea monitor. However, the child stopped breathing again and no one discovered the problem for several minutes. He died four days later. The Dents brought this wrongful death suit against the Hospital, alleging that their son died as a result of both ordinary and professional negligence on the part of the Hospital and its nursing staff. The trial court initially granted the Hospital's motion for summary judgment, but that judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals. Dent v. Memorial Hosp. of Adel, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../343/72/index.html">200 Ga. App. 499 (408 SE2d 473) (1991)</a></span>. The case proceeded to trial, where the evidence conflicted in several respects, including whether the alarm on the apnea monitor failed to sound, whether the nursing staff failed to turn the alarm switch to the "on" position, and whether the Hospital's crash cart lacked several essential items for pediatric patients. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Hospital after being instructed, in relevant part, that "if you find from the evidence in this case that the defendants did not commit any acts of professional negligence or malpractice, a verdict in the plaintiffs' favor would be unlawful. . . ." In their appeal, the Dents contended that this instruction might have misled the jury to believe that it must find professional negligence in order to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that the charge could not have confused the jury into believing it could disregard the issue of ordinary negligence. Dent v. Memorial Hosp. of Adel, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../262/53/index.html">227 Ga. App. 801 (490 SE2d 509) (1997)</a></span>. We granted certiorari to review this ruling of the Court of Appeals.</div><div class="casepar">The Hospital urges that the plaintiffs did not object to the charge with the requisite specificity. The Dents' objection that the charge "left out the possibility of a verdict based on ordinary negligence" was "stated distinctly enough for a 'reasonable' trial judge to understand its nature, enabling him to rule intelligently on the specific point." Christiansen v. Robertson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/94/index.html">237 Ga. 711</a></span>, 712 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/94/index.html">229 SE2d 472</a></span>) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">The instruction which required a defense verdict if the jury found no professional negligence conflicted with other instructions which authorized the jury to consider ordinary negligence. " 'A charge containing two distinct propositions conflicting the one with the other is calculated to leave the jury in such a confused condition of mind that they can not render an intelligible verdict, and requires the grant of a new trial.' [Cits.]" Clements v. Clements, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../782/3/index.html">247 Ga. 787</a></span>, 789 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../782/3/index.html">279 SE2d 698</a></span>) (1981). See also Moreland v. Word, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../189/49/index.html">209 Ga. 463</a></span>, 466 (7) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../189/49/index.html">74 SE2d 82</a></span>) (1953).</div><div class="casepar">The jury cannot be expected to select one part of a charge to the exclusion of another, nor to decide between conflicts therein, nor to determine whether one part cures a previous error, without having their attention specially called thereto and being instructed accordingly. </div><div class="casepar">Morrison v. Dickey, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 698 (2) (46 SE 863) (1904)</span>. The trial court's charge was in irreconcilable conflict and was never properly corrected, and by no reasoning are we able to say that this conflict was harmless. See Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/80/index.html">148 Ga. App. 702</a></span>, 704 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/80/index.html">252 SE2d 205</a></span>) (1979); State Hwy. Dept. v. Hilliard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../652/21/index.html">112 Ga. App. 498</a></span>, 499 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../652/21/index.html">145 SE2d 824</a></span>) (1965); Baxter v. State Hwy. Dept., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/11/index.html">108 Ga. App. 324 (132 SE2d 863) (1963)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The dissent opines that each criticism of the nursing staff's actions was an assertion of professional negligence and that the allegations of ordinary negligence relate only to the purported failure of the hospital to train the nurses, which could not have proximately caused the child's death apart from some failure of the nurses to meet the professional standard of care. Whether the negligence alleged by a plaintiff is ordinary negligence or professional malpractice is a question of law. Drawdy v. Dept. of Transp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../259/05/index.html">228 Ga. App. 338</a></span>, 339 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../259/05/index.html">491 SE2d 521</a></span>) (1997). " 'If the alleged negligent act or omission of a hospital employee does not require the exercise of expert medical judgment, the fact that the employee also has expert medical credentials does not make the case one of "medical malpractice." ' " Lamb v. Candler General Hosp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/3/index.html">262 Ga. 70</a></span>, 71 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/3/index.html">413 SE2d 720</a></span>) (1992). Whether to use certain equipment at all, what type of equipment to use, and whether certain equipment should be available in a specific case certainly are decisions which normally require the evaluation of the medical condition of a particular patient and, therefore, the application of professional knowledge, skill, and experience. However, the failure to operate equipment correctly or in accordance with a doctor's instructions or to keep certain equipment on hand is only ordinary, not professional, negligence. See Robinson v. Med. Center of Central Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../287/76/index.html">217 Ga. App. 8</a></span>, 9-10 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../287/76/index.html">456 SE2d 254</a></span>) (1995); Sparks v. Southwest Community Hosp. &amp; Med. Center, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../363/05/index.html">195 Ga. App. 858 (395 SE2d 68) (1990)</a></span>; Porter v. Patterson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../664/02/index.html">107 Ga. App. 64</a></span>, 71 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../664/02/index.html">129 SE2d 70</a></span>) (1962). An administrative act not involving professional knowledge, skill or experience is not required to be the subject of an expert opinion. Hillhaven Rehabilitation &amp; Convalescent Center v. Patterson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../359/78/index.html">195 Ga. App. 70</a></span>, 72 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../359/78/index.html">392 SE2d 557</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">One such administrative act is a nurse's application of a heating pad to a patient, pursuant to the doctor's orders, but with the switch on the wrong setting. Porter v. Patterson, supra at 71-72 (1). Such an act is indistinguishable from the nurses' alleged failure in this case to activate the alarm on the apnea monitor as the doctor had ordered. This allegation and other averments regarding incorrect operation of the apnea monitor by the nurses and their failure to follow the doctor's orders are not ones of professional negligence. Moreover, the allegation that the nurses failed to ensure that the "crash cart" was equipped for pediatric patients is one of ordinary negligence. Lamb v. Candler General Hosp., supra at 71 (1); Jenkins County Hosp. Auth. v. Landrum, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/13/index.html">206 Ga. App. 753 (426 SE2d 572) (1992)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs alleged and presented evidence that certain actions of the nurses themselves constituted ordinary negligence. Thus, the charge was erroneous and harmful in that it might have misled the jury into believing that it could not return a verdict in favor of plaintiffs based upon this ordinary negligence.</div><div class="casepar">BENHAM, Chief Justice, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent to the majority's reversal of the judgment entered on the jury's verdict in favor of the defendant hospital. Appellants and the majority believe that another jury trial is necessitated by the trial court's instruction that the jury could not return a lawful verdict for the plaintiffs if the jury found that the hospital employees did not commit any acts of professional negligence or malpractice. The majority bases its conclusion on the belief that certain of the alleged acts of nursing negligence constitute ordinary negligence because the acts purportedly amount to a failure to operate equipment correctly or are administrative acts not involving professional knowledge. It appears from the majority opinion's succinct summation of the nursing activities at issue that the majority's position stems from a misapprehension of the vital role nurses play in medical care-giving, and a failure to understand the significance of the General Assembly's recognition of nursing as a licensed and regulated profession. From reading the transcript of the four-day trial, I have concluded that each of the plaintiffs' criticisms of the nursing staff's actions was an assertion of professional negligence since each involved the exercise of professional nursing skill and judgment. There being no ordinary negligence for which the hospital could be held liable, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> the trial court's charge was not error. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Through legislative enactment, nursing has been recognized statutorily as a profession. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/26/1/index.html">43-26-1</a></span> et seq. When a negligence action creates an issue in which professional skill and judgment are involved, professional negligence is at issue. Lamb v. Candler Gen. Hosp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/3/index.html">262 Ga. 70 (1) (413 SE2d 720) (1992)</a></span>. Where, as here, the negligence is an alleged failure to perform nursing duties and responsibilities with the requisite degree of care and skill required of the nursing profession, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> the negligence action is one for professional negligence since it "calls into question the conduct of a professional in [the professional's] area of expertise" and the allegations of negligence involve the questioning of expert nursing judgments. Candler Gen. Hosp. v. McNorrill, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/93/index.html">182 Ga. App. 107 (2) (354 SE2d 872) (1987)</a></span>. See also Chafin v. Wesley Homes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../393/22/index.html">186 Ga. App. 403 (1) (367 SE2d 236) (1988)</a></span>; Gen. Hosp. of Humana v. Bentley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../400/61/index.html">184 Ga. App. 489</a></span>, 490 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../400/61/index.html">361 SE2d 718</a></span>) (1987). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> In Chafin, the allegations found to aver professional negligence included the use of a catheter, the allegedly wrongful administration of drugs, and the decision to feed a patient intravenously. In Bentley, the Court of Appeals ruled that hospital employees exercised expert professional judgment when the medical condition of the patient was the determinative factor in deciding on the amount of supervision to be given a patient. In Robinson v. Medical Ctr. of Central Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../287/76/index.html">217 Ga. App. 8 (456 SE2d 254) (1995)</a></span>, because the decision to employ bed side rails was a matter of nursing judgment predicated on an overall assessment of the patient, it was a question of professional negligence whether the rails on the plaintiff's bed should have been raised. The assertion that professional hospital personnel having the duty to take a patient's vital signs did not do so promptly and at appropriate intervals, was an allegation of professional negligence. See Dozier v. Clayton County Hosp. Auth., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/76/index.html">206 Ga. App. 62</a></span>, 65 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/76/index.html">424 SE2d 632</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">Ordinary negligence, on the other hand, is at issue where the allegedly negligent conduct involves the execution of issued instructions which execution requires no exercise of professional judgment or skill (Robinson v. Medical Center of Central Ga., supra, 217 Ga. App. at 10 (emphasis supplied)), or the performance of mere administrative or clerical tasks, again involving no professional judgment or skill. See, e.g., Candler Gen. Hosp. v. McNorrill, supra, 182 Ga. App. at 110, where moving a patient from a stretcher to a wheelchair, an act of relative physical strength and dexterity rather than an act requiring the exercise of expert medical judgment," did not constitute an act of professional negligence.</div><div class="casepar">The majority opinion points to two allegations of nursing conduct as alleging ordinary negligence. In Porter v. Patterson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../664/02/index.html">107 Ga. App. 64 (129 SE2d 70) (1962)</a></span>, cited by the majority as involving an act of ordinary negligence indistinguishable from one act of negligence involved herein, the issue was not whether the nurse's allegedly neg-</div><div class="casepar">bicarbonate, pediatric-size defribillating pads, and a curved pediatric laryngoscope blade; failing to have the appropriately-sized mask for use with the ambu bag; and by not writing up a "code sheet" during the efforts to revive the child.</div><div class="casepar">ligent act was one of professional or ordinary negligence, but whether the hospital employer or the patient's physician was responsible under respondeat superior for the nurse's negligence. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> The majority also concludes that the nurses' alleged failure to ensure that the "crash cart" was equipped for a pediatric patient constituted ordinary negligence. A hospital may be negligent under the "locality rule" if the facilities and services are not comparable to those "in general use under the same, or similar, circumstances in hospitals in the area. . . ." Candler Gen. Hosp. v. McNorrill, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/93/index.html">182 Ga. App. 107 (1)</a></span>. However, where the plaintiffs question the professional judgment of the hospital's nurses rather than the adequacy of the services or the facilities, the "locality rule" standard of care is not applicable and the exercise of professional judgment is governed by the standard of care ordinarily employed by that profession generally. Wade v. John D. Archbold Mem. Hosp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../635/4/index.html">252 Ga. 118</a></span>, 119 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../635/4/index.html">311 SE2d 836</a></span>) (1984); Candler Gen. Hosp. v. Joiner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../414/35/index.html">180 Ga. App. 455 (1) (349 SE2d 756) (1986)</a></span>. In the case at bar, plaintiffs' attorney repeatedly assured the trial court and defense counsel that plaintiffs were not attempting to prove "locality rule" negligence and, in lieu of evidence of what similarly situated hospitals provide on their crash cart, plaintiffs went on to present expert testimony that the nurses fell below the professional standard of care by failing to have available on the crash cart the instruments the nurses knew a physician preferred, and the proper-sized equipment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> Thus, with regard to the assertions that the crash cart was not properly equipped, the plaintiffs chose to forego proving ordinary "locality rule" negligence on the part of the hospital and set about to establish that the allegedly ill-equipped crash cart was the product of the nursing staff's flawed exercise of professional judgment. The majority, by asserting that the allegation of negligence was one of ordinary negligence, disregards the statements of plaintiffs' counsel as to what he was alleging and improperly substitutes its judgment as to how the case should have been tried for that of plaintiffs' counsel.</div><div class="casepar">Because I believe that the alleged acts of negligence on the part of the hospital nursing staff involved matters in which the nurses exercised their professional judgment and skill based upon an overall assessment of their young patient, I must respectfully dissent to the majority's conclusion that this tragic case contained aspects of ordinary negligence.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Presiding Justice Fletcher and Justice Sears join this dissent.</div><div class="casepar">Hall, Booth, Smith &amp; Slover, John E.

If, however, none of the nurses' alleged shortcomings constituted professional negligence, then whatever negligence there may have been in the hospital's training of the nurses could not have been proximately related to the child's death since the hospital's alleged shortcoming did not result in the failure of the nursing staff to meet the appropriate standard of care.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      While I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I do not endorse the rationale employed by that court in reaching its judgment.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      There was expert testimony that the nurses had violated the appropriate standard of care by failing to follow the admitting physician's orders to take the child's temperature every hour, to place a vaporizer in the child's room, and to obtain a chest x-ray of the child. Other expert testimony found fault with the nursing personnel for failing to adjust the "gain knob to record respiration on the apnea monitor; failing to connect both the respiratory and cardiac monitoring functions of the apnea monitor; failing to set both the cardiac and respiratory alarms on the monitor; failing to turn on the respiratory alarm; failing to make written comments about the child after connecting him to the apnea monitor; taking a lengthy period of time to connect the child to the monitor; failing to place a board under the child during resuscitation attempts; failing to establish an IV portal and to intubate the child before the treating physician arrived; failing to fill out a pediatric resuscitation medical chart before the child's apneic event; failing to have the crash cart equipped with pediatric</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      The hospital may be held liable under a theory of respondeat superior for the professional negligence of its employee nurses. Holloway v. Northside Hosp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../254/06/index.html">230 Ga. App. 371 (496 SE2d 510) (1998)</a></span>; Minster v.

      Porter v. Patterson is also known for being an early statement of the "locality rule," the standard by which is measured a hospital's purported negligence in providing equipment and facilities. See Wade v. John D. Archbold Mem. Hosp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../635/4/index.html">252 Ga. 118 (311 SE2d 836) (1984)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      In response, the hospital presented expert testimony that nurses do not fall below the professional standard of care in not having the "preferred" instruments and "size-appropriate" equipment on the crash cart.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Gray &amp; Hedrick, William E.
