DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Wheeler.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Appellant, Dr. Linda Hallman, filed suit in June 1994 against appellees, Emory University, the Emory Clinic, and various University administrators, in an employment dispute. After a lengthy two-day preliminary injunction hearing, an interlocutory injunction against the appellees was granted to appellant on August 5, 1994. After the grant of the interlocutory injunction to appellant, the appellees were very anxious to take appellant's deposition; appellant repeatedly postponed scheduled depositions, cancelled at the last minute, or failed to appear altogether. In August 1995, appellees filed a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, to compel and impose sanctions. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice and awarded $1,250 in attorney fees on August 23, 1995. Upon motion for reconsideration, the trial court modified its order of dismissal to make it a dismissal without prejudice on September 25, 1995. On October 9, 1995, appellees made a motion for an award of attorney fees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (a), (b), and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/81/index.html">51-7-81</a></span> for abusive litigation, supported only by the affidavit of one of the three counsel involved and without even the hourly billing statements. The trial court on March 9, 1996, entered an award of attorney fees under all statutes without conducting an evidentiary hearing either as to the merits of the motion or as to the hours, reasonableness, amount, necessity or allocation of attorney fees, and specifically found that Counts 2 and 3 of the complaint were filed with malice, authorizing the award of attorney fees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/81/index.html">51-7-81</a></span>, which were awarded based only upon the defense counsel's affidavit and without hearing evidence or allowing cross-examination by appellant's counsel of appellees' counsel regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the $44,240.13 awarded. The trial court ignored some 221 pages of transcript of the interlocutory injunction hearing, as well as the interlocutory injunction order, as such related to Counts 2 and 3 in finding that there was no justiciable issue under either OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (a) or  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. Appellant challenges on direct appeal the award of attorney fees. However, appellees have moved to dismiss the appeal on jurisdictional grounds. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">This Court, in Rolleston v. Huie, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../348/63/index.html">198 Ga. App. 49</a></span>, 51-52 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../348/63/index.html">400 SE2d 349</a></span>) (1990), held that there is no direct appeal from an award of attorney fees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> unless it appears that such award was appealed as part of a judgment that is directly appealable. See also Stancil v. Gwinnett County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../447/0/index.html">259 Ga. 507</a></span>, 508 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../447/0/index.html">384 SE2d 666</a></span>) (1989); Haggard v. Bd. of Regents &amp;c. of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../518/1/index.html">257 Ga. 524</a></span>, 526 (4) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../518/1/index.html">360 SE2d 566</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">In Ga. L. 1989, p. 408,  2, the General Assembly created a new cause of action for abusive litigation and codified it as OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq., which became effective on July 1, 1989, and which provided for procedures that were part of the elements of the action. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq., as a new statutory cause of action, replaced several existing common law actions: malicious use of process; malicious abuse of process; and a claim under Yost v. Torok, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../532/5/index.html">256 Ga. 92 (344 SE2d 414) (1986)</a></span>. Since OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. is in derogation of common law, then it must be strictly construed. Kirsch v. Meredith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../309/31/index.html">211 Ga. App. 823</a></span>, 825 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../309/31/index.html">440 SE2d 702</a></span>) (1994). Unlike OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, which is a court-imposed sanction for misconduct in litigation, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. is an independent cause of action based upon the successful termination of the action upon which it is based and is not procedurally ancillary and post-judgment, as is OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, except when only attorney fees are sought under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b). Hutchison v. Divorce &amp; Custody Law Center &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/74/index.html">207 Ga. App. 421</a></span>, 423 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/74/index.html">427 SE2d 784</a></span>) (1993). An action for abusive litigation must be brought as a separate and distinct action where damages are sought; however, when only attorney fees in the original abusive litigation are sought, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) provides that "the procedures provided in Code Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> shall be utilized." However, such language does not change an action under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. to damages imposed as a sanction under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, but merely directs which procedures shall be followed under such circumstances. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) provides a cause of action and directs the procedure by which damages are to be sought in order to simplify the action. See generally Stocks v. Glover, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/26/index.html">220 Ga. App. 557</a></span>, 559 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/26/index.html">469 SE2d 677</a></span>) (1996); McKin v. Gilbert, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../318/56/index.html">208 Ga. App. 788</a></span>, 791 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../318/56/index.html">432 SE2d 233</a></span>) (1993); Talbert v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../343/06/index.html">200 Ga. App. 312 (408 SE2d 125) (1991)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar"> Williams v. Clark-Atlanta Univ., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../342/09/index.html">200 Ga. App. 51</a></span>, 52 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../342/09/index.html">406 SE2d 559</a></span>) (1991), is distinguishable on the law and facts in that the action arose prior to July 1, 1989, the effective date of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq., so that this statute could not be applied retroactively, and the action was dismissed on the merits and attorney fees were imposed as a judicial sanction under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>. In the case sub judice, the underlying action was dismissed without prejudice, came within OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, and attorney fees were imposed both as a judicial sanction and as damages under the abusive litigation action as a final judgment. Under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/84/index.html">51-7-84</a></span> (b), a "final termination of the proceeding" means that the case has been finally concluded and has nothing ancillary pending, except when the party may follow the procedures of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> in bringing a claim for attorney fees from the abusive litigation case within 45 days as an ancillary matter under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b). Since OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) could not be applied retroactively in Williams v. Clark-Atlanta Univ., supra, then anything stated by this Court regarding the discretionary appeal procedure for attorney fees awarded under such Code section was obiter dicta, because such language was not necessary to the decision of the case.</div><div class="casepar">While the same procedures must be followed under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) as employed under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. does not come within the express language of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/35/index.html">5-6-35</a></span> (a), which lists cases requiring application for appeal; subsection (a) (10) requires an application for appeals of an award of attorney fees only under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> and does not require OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) to come under such discretionary appeal procedure, even though it involves the same trial procedure. The General Assembly, by enacting Ga. L. 1988, p. 1357,  1, created OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/35/index.html">5-6-35</a></span> (a) (1) through (10), but the General Assembly neither amended the statute in 1989 when OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) was passed, nor did it choose to include OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. in Ga. L. 1991, p. 412,  1, or Ga. L. 1994, p. 347,  2, when OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/35/index.html">5-6-35</a></span> was further amended. Such omission of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. from discretionary appeals clearly expresses the legislative intent that this substantive new cause of action should have a right of direct appeal whenever a final judgment has been entered. An award under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span> (b) of attorney fees is an award of damages without a jury trial on the merits and constitutes a final judgment that is directly appealable.</div><div class="casepar">To award attorney fees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (a) requires the same findings as under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. so that there exists an appeal which otherwise would be discretionary under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span>, but "may be reviewed on direct appeal, when it is appealed as part of a judgment directly appealable." Haggard v. Bd. of Regents &amp;c. of Ga., supra at 526 (4) (a); Rolleston v. Huie, supra at 52. Therefore, the award of attorney fees under both OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (a) and (b) is reviewable on direct appeal along with the judgment under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/83/index.html">51-7-83</a></span>, and this Court has jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">The motion to dismiss is hereby denied.</div><div class="casepar">1. Since appellant's right to a direct appeal rests upon an appeal from a judgment under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq., then the applicable enumeration of error will be dealt with first. The trial court is alleged to have erred in the granting of attorney fees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq., and we agree.</div><div class="casepar">The threshold issue is whether or not an action under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. was ripe at the time the trial court entered a judgment based upon such statute. Had the trial court not voided the order dismissing the action with prejudice, such order would have acted as an adjudication on the merits, a "final termination" of the case. However, the trial court vacated such order and substituted for it a dismissal without prejudice, which was not a "final termination" of the case. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/41/index.html">9-11-41</a></span> (b). Since OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/80/index.html">51-7-80</a></span> et seq. is a statutory cause of action in derogation of common law, then it must be strictly construed against the party seeking to assert the statute. See Heard v.

Such judicial determination is substantially the equivalent to the denial of a motion for summary judgment, so that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (a) does not apply under Porter v.

Haggard v. Bd. of Regents &amp;c. of Ga., supra at 527.</div><div class="casepar">3. The appellant's next enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in granting attorney fees to the appellees under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (b) upon a finding that the appellant unnecessarily expanded the proceedings by improper conduct, because there existed ample evidence to show that any delays caused in the prosecution of the appellant's case were not the result of improper conduct by appellant or her counsel.</div><div class="casepar">776, 778 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../347/84/index.html">406 SE2d 121</a></span>) (1991).</div><div class="casepar">While appellant has submitted conflicting evidence, the trial court is to determine weight and credibility of the evidence. The alleged misconduct occurred after the grant of the interlocutory injunction so such order provides no defense.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing attorney fees in some amount within OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (b).</div><div class="casepar">4. The appellant's last enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in granting attorney fees because the evidence was insufficient to enable the trial court to assess the attorney fee award.</div><div class="casepar">The General Assembly mandated, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (f), that "[a]n award of reasonable and necessary attorney's fees or expenses of litigation [as a sanction] . . . shall be determined by the court." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/15/14/index.html">9-15-14</a></span> (d) limits such award so that the award "shall not exceed amounts which are reasonable and necessary for defending . . . the rights of a party." This imposes an affirmative duty upon the trial court to hear evidence and allow the cross-examination of counsel as to the necessity, reasonableness, and amount of work done by counsel by the opposite party prior to the imposition of an award related to the basis for the sanction. In the case sub judice, the trial court failed to hold a hearing and allow movant to be cross-examined regarding such fees. Appellees' counsel merely submitted an affidavit filled with hearsay and conclusions and devoid of facts upon which the trial court must exercise its sound discretion in making an award. Counsel did not state the total hours worked by each lawyer on each issue which authorized the imposition of sanctions; provide the hourly billing rate for each counsel; testify that the rates were the normal rate; specify what work was performed; or explain why, in a case where there had been no discovery done and only a two-day hearing over approximately one year's time that the total fees exceeded $42,045 and expenses of $2,195.13, particularly when the initial sanction for discovery abuse requested had been an award of only $1,250. Under the circumstances, ordering an award without conducting a hearing and without important evidence, such as the billing records, constituted an abuse of discretion by the trial judge and lacked evidence upon which to exercise the sound discretion of the court in imposing a reasonable sanction.</div><div class="casepar">"The record does not show [that the non-movant] was afforded such opportunity [of a hearing on the award of attorney fees where the movant's counsel could be cross-examined], and the judgment must be reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine an amount for reasonable and necessary attorney fees."

The court held that an affidavit of an attorney with billing statements attached which told what two lawyers and the paralegal had done was hearsay as to what anyone did other than the affiant. Id. at 31. " 'A determination of the amount of an award of attorney fees cannot be based upon guesswork. [Cit.]' [Cit.] Such an award must be based on competent evidence, not inadmissible hearsay. [Cits.]" Mitcham v. Blalock, supra at 32. "Nor did the process of allowing [movant] to submit edited time [sheet] records and affidavits adequately afford [the non-movant's] attorney the opportunity to cross-examine [movant's] attorneys either on the issues of reasonableness and value or on the allocation of time and expenses among the various claims. A determination of the amount of an award of attorney fees cannot be based on guesswork." Southern Cellular Telecom v.
