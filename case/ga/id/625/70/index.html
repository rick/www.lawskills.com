Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Etheridge.</div><div class="casepresiding">DEEN, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, made and granted in a jury case at the close of the plaintiff's evidence where the trial judge certified that he considered both pleadings and evidence in entering the order, is considered as a motion for directed verdict.</div><div class="casepar">2. Where the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff shows that a partnership between the plaintiff and the defendant existed, in fact, that it sustained losses, that it ceased to do business prior to the filing of this action, and that nothing remained to be done except for an accounting and winding up of the partnership affairs, it was error to dismiss an action for contribution against the defendant as to sums properly paid out on behalf of the partnership by the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">3. The dismissal of the co-defendant employee, Norma Waddell, as a party to this suit is without error.</div><div class="casepar">Todd brought an action in the Superior Court of Fulton County against Waddell and his wife alleging that he and Waddell had entered into an oral partnership agreement on September 1, 1965, to be known as Todd &amp; Waddell Forklift Co. for the purpose of servicing, repairing and selling forklifts; that they agreed to share equally in profits and losses; that it was agreed that plaintiff would contribute the money to commence business which would constitute a loan to the corporation repayable by it but borrowed by plaintiff personally and Waddell would furnish his full time and special knowledge to the business and be reimbursed by a salary of $600 per month; that the partnership executed a five-year lease and began to do business in September, 1965; that from time to time it became obvious that the business could not proceed without more capital, which the plaintiff obtained for it, all of the money for this purpose having been borrowed by the plaintiff on his personal credit, and payments made out of partnership funds during the time it was doing business; that the firm name was changed in May, 1966, to Ponce de Leon Equipment Company; that the defendants prevented him from examining the partnership books, were guilty of certain acts of fraud, and that on October 28, 1966, he was informed that the partnership was insolvent; that Waddell has refused to participate in marshaling assets or winding up the business and has publicly disavowed any interest therein, but has proceeded to commingle his equipment with that of the partnership and to carry on his individual business with partnership funds. Plaintiff has paid partnership debts out of personal funds in the sum of $5,457.19. He initially prayed for a decree of dissolution of the partnership, receiver, production of partnership records, a money judgment, accounting, and injunction. During the trial of the case he added by amendment without objection prayers for (a) 50% of all sums found to have been fraudulently diverted by the defendants from the partnership and (b) 50% of sums paid out by the plaintiff for partnership debts and operating capital.</div><div class="casepar">The petition was filed in November, 1966. When the case was called for trial in January, 1969, the plaintiff testified substantially in accordance with the allegations of the petition. The defendant was called for cross examination. He agreed with the plaintiff that the parties had in fact entered into an oral partnership on an agreement that he would give full time to the business, receiving $150 per week, that he had testified in a deposition that the agreement was "50-50 as far as profits were concerned"; that there had been no discussion of losses; that the plaintiff put money in the business which he considered to be the plaintiff's individual contribution, although the partnership paid the notes to the bank while it was operating; that two invoices to other companies during the time the partnership was in existence were paid after the partnership was dissolved, and that he placed these payments in a personal account but used them to pay salary or other partnership debts. He further testified, as did the plaintiff, that the partnership ceased to function after October 28, 1966.</div><div class="casepar">At the close of the plaintiff's evidence the court on motion entered an order dismissing the case "for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted," certifying that his decision was based upon a consideration of both pleadings and evidence. From this judgment the plaintiff appeals.</div><div class="casepar">2. The partnership not being in dispute, each partner is liable for the business losses of the firm. Code  75-206. A partnership at will may be dissolved by the giving of three months' notice to the partner (Code  75-106) or it may be dissolved immediately by mutual consent or by the extinction of the business for which it was formed. Code  75-107. Dissolution may occur although there has been no prior accounting and although a general windup of the business affairs is still necessary. Code  75-109. Third persons, However, have generally a right to look to the firm until notice of dissolution or dissent or until the commencement of a legal action for dissolution. Code  75-302. Dissolution of the partnership as such, however, as between the partners, may be implied from their acts and conduct (Johnson v. Inman, 223 Ala. 513 (137 S 293)) and here, where it appears without dispute that by October, 1966, one partner had taken steps to eject the other from the property and the other had commenced carrying on an individual business, it is fairly clear that nothing remained of the partnership business as such except a determination of losses, payment of debts, and other like acts involving a general accounting and winding up of the business. Therefore, those cases holding that during the pendency of the partnership "one of the partners can not maintain against the other an action at law" do not apply here. See Miller &amp; Son v. Freeman, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 654 (1)</span> (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 961</span>, 51 LRA 504). At the least, the affairs of the partnership must be in a position where the jury can ascertain what is justly due as a balance by one partner to the other. Paulk v. Creech, <span class="casemissing">8 Ga. App. 738 (5) (70 SE 145)</span>. The difficulty so far as the trial of this case was concerned appears to be that the allegations of the original petition suggested a situation where the partnership still existed as a business concern whereas the proof showed without dispute that it had in fact ended over two years before the trial. The amendment offered by the plaintiff during the trial seeking a money judgment for one half of the business losses which had actually been paid by him personally was relevant to the facts as the plaintiff's evidence showed them to be. After payment of the partnership debts, the petitioning partner is entitled to an accounting without the necessity of showing any exact amount as due, if he alleges and shows 'facts sufficient to indicate that something will be found to be due him'; and he is entitled to a personal money judgment against the indebted partner for such amount as may be shown by the proof. Bowman v. Chapman, <span class="casemissing">179 Ga. 49 (2) (175 SE 241)</span>; Ferrell v. Wight, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 360</span>, 367 (<span class="casemissing">200 SE 271</span>); Gould v. Barrow, <span class="casemissing">117 Ga. 458 (43 SE 702)</span>." Johnson v. Townsend, <span class="casemissing">192 Ga. 522</span>, 524 (<span class="casemissing">15 SE2d 790</span>). The pleadings and evidence made a jury question here at the very least as to certain admitted partnership debts which had been paid by the plaintiff and for which he was entitled to reimbursement of one half of the payment from the defendant partner.</div><div class="casepar">3.
