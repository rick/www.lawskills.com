(a) Where the evidence authorized the jury to find that the defendant in a criminal case intended to commit a particular act, the requirement of Code  26-201 that there must be a union or joint operation of the act and intent is met. It is not necessary for the State to show, in order to meet this requirement, that the defendant also intended to violate the law.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Although a written request to charge the jury is properly adjusted to the evidence, it may still be refused where the matter contained therein has been sufficiently covered by the general charge.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Where the court charges the jury generally to consider all the evidence and base their verdict thereon, it is not necessary, even when requested, to point out specific evidence offered in behalf of the defendant and charge the jury particularly to consider such evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(d) It is not error for the trial court to refuse to give in charge to the jury a request which is imperfect and fails to state an accurate principle of law properly adjusted to the issues of the case on trial.</div><div class="casepar">Toby Balark, Richard Frazier, Harry Rowe and Marion White, the respective plaintiffs in error in these cases, were tried and convicted in the City Court of Savannah for a violation of Code  45-512, which provides in part as follows: "The use of all nets except hand drawn nets in the inside salt water rivers, creeks and estuaries, is hereby prohibited . . . during the months of March, April, May, June and July of each year. The boundaries of the sounds are as shown in Bulletin 19 of the United States Geodetic Survey. Outside salt waters are defined as those waters from the outermost part of the coast line to the limit of the three-mile jurisdiction, and embrace that part of the Atlantic Ocean under the jurisdiction of this State. Inland salt waters not included in outside salt waters include all sounds, estuaries, salt water rivers and creeks." The men were arrested on May 9 at approximately the same time, in separate boats, charged with being inside the waters of Ossabaw Sound, an estuary approximately two miles long and three and a half miles wide between Wassaw and Ossabaw Islands. The undisputed testimony established the line dividing the inside from the outside waters as an imaginary line projected from two markers located on the north tip of Ossabaw Island, and running 220 feet to the land side of a buoy located in the channel, which line was actually somewhat inside the actual projection of a line between the outside shores of the two islands. Captain Bell, an employee of the State Game and Fish Commission and a witness for the State, testified substantially that his boat was located in Bradley Creek on Ossabaw Island when he saw the boats heading in towards the prohibited area; that he went into the sound to a point where he could line up the range with the buoy; that the first boat was one and, one-half miles away and within the prohibited area; that visibility was good and the boats moving very slowly; that he went on up and west into the sound and as he got back to the line the boats were coming out; that Rowe's boat was operating approximately on the line but his net was still on the inside; that White's boat was about 300 yards inside; that Frazier's boat was inside following Rowe's, and that Balark's boat was approximately a mile inside. This testimony was confirmed by another employee, J. C. Mikell, who was in the boat with Bell and who stated that Rowe and White were "approximately on the line." As to the "Pocahontas," Rowe's boat, he stated, "We had watched that particular boat coming in because we could see it, and I kept my eyes on that. Anyhow, I watched that particular boat to see if we could get to him before he got across and we got to him just about the time that he was coming across the line and we were coming in and he was coming out." The third witness, who was patrolling the area with an airplane at that time, identified the boats of Balark, White and Frazier as being in the prohibited area but made no mention of Rowe's boat. Rowe in his statement placed his boat as outside that of the other defendants, and this was never denied. All the defendants made statements denying that they were inside the prohibited area.</div><div class="casepar">To the judgments based on the verdicts of guilty the defendants filed identical motions for new trials on the general grounds, which were later amended by adding 12 special grounds numbered 6-17 inclusive, and the overruling of these motions as amended is assigned as error. Identical briefs were filed in each case, and they are here considered together.</div><div class="casepar">Ground 12 contains a similar request to charge that the de fend-ants would not be guilty if they simply drifted into the inside waters. The request in ground 13 refers to lack of intention in case the defendants crossed the line through inadvertence "with no intention of fishing deeply into the sound."</div><div class="casepar">The intent referred to in Code  26-201 is intent to do a specific act in violation of law, rather than an intent to violate the law itself, or an intent to violate it in one degree but not in another degree. The evidence here authorized the jury to find that the defendants Balark, White and Frazier were actually over the line that divided the outside waters from the inside waters and that at the time they were in the inside waters they were operating their power-driven craft with their nets in fishing position. The evidence authorized the jury to find that these defendants intended to commit these acts. These acts are in violation of Code  45-512. In Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Carroll, <span class="casemissing">169 Ga. 333</span>, at page 343 (150 S. E. 208), it is held that "The conscious and intentional violation of a penal statute which constitutes wilful misconduct of the employee, is the conscious or intentional doing of an act which violates the statute, though he be not thinking of breaking it."</div><div class="casepar">The charges were not adjusted to the issues of the case and for that reason were properly refused by the trial court. See Ward v. State, <span class="casemissing">199 Ga. 203 (2)</span> (33 S. E. 2d, 689). The court did charge that, "Mere presence at the time and place that the crime is committed is of course wholly insufficient of itself to show active participation in the crime." This, together with other charges on this subject, fully and fairly covered the element of intent. Special grounds 6, 12 and 13 are therefore without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Special ground 16 complains of the refusal of the following request to charge: "You must look into all the circumstances surrounding this incident and determine from such circumstances if the defendants had any intention to violate the law." Code  26-201 and 26-202 are cited as authority for this request. Assuming, but not deciding, that this charge was properly adjusted to the issues of the case, these sections were charged in the exact language of the Code, and covered the subject matter of this request. A written request to charge may be refused where it has been covered by the general charge. Loeb v. State, <span class="casemissing">6 Ga. App. 23 (3)</span> (64 S. E. 338); The trial court is not compelled to adopt the precise language of counsel contained in the request if the charge given sufficiently covers the principles of law involved. Smith v. Wolf, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 19</span> (176 S. E. 889). It is not error, even with request, to fail to charge that "In the commission of a crime or misdemeanor there must be a union or joint act and intention or criminal negligence" where the court charges fully on the essential elements of the crime with which the defendant is charged. Bennett v. State, <span class="casemissing">49 Ga. App. 804</span> (176 S. E. 148). Special ground 16 of the amended motions for new trials is therefore without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Grounds 7, 8, 9 and 15 are requests to charge on the condition of the bottom over which the defendants were accused of drawing their nets. Ground 7 contained the following request: "If you shall find that the inside waters west of the dividing line of Ossabaw Sound contain on the bottom thereof mud and silt, which would break up the fishermen's nets, you may consider such evidence in determining whether or not it was practical to fish inside and you may therefore in your province as jurors, if you see fit, determine that the defendants would not fish inside in view of such impractical circumstances." Ground 8 assumes that the waters are muddy and silty. Ground 9 contains an expression of opinion that the defendants' statements are plausible. Ground 15 contains an assumption that there is no point in large vessels entering the prohibited area All these requests, had they been given by the court, would have pointed out specific evidence on behalf of the defendant for the jury to consider in reaching a verdict. Construing the charge of the court as a whole, it was made clear to the jury that the defendants were presumed to be innocent until the evidence showed them to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; that the jurors were the judges of both the. law and the facts; that they were to take the law as given them in charge by the court and the facts from the witnesses who testified and from such evidence as was introduced and admitted and from the statements of the defendants. From the charge as a whole it was made clear to the jury that they were to consider all of the evidence. It was therefore not incumbent upon the trial judge, even after request, to specifically point out particular evidence in behalf of the defendants which the jury should specially consider. As was stated in Lewis v. State, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 755</span> (27 S. E. 2d, 659): "A request to charge the jury must be correct and even perfect; otherwise refusal to give it is not error. It must be legal, apt, and precisely adjusted to some principle involved in the case, and be authorized by flee evidence." The imperfection inherent in the argumentative character of these requests, which are more adjusted to the exhortation of counsel than to the impartial clarity which should characterize the instructions of the court, is sufficient reason for their refusal. Special grounds 7, 8, 9 and 15 of the amended motions for new trials are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Special ground 17 includes all the grounds contained in special grounds 6-16 inclusive, and since those grounds show no cause for reversal of these cases, special ground 17 is likewise without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(2) The undisputed testimony shows that the State's witnesses determined the line dividing the outside Waters from the prohibited area of the sound by sighting between the range (the two targets placed one behind the other on Ossabaw Island) and the buoy some distance away; that actually this projection was about 220 feet out of line, and that, considering the distance and ordinary difficulty of visibility of such objects on or close to the Water, the eye could not establish the line With absolute certainty. As to the defendants Balark, Frazier and White, the testimony of the three Witnesses for the State places their boats far enough within this imaginary line to have authorized the jury to find that they were fishing in the prohibited area. As to Rowe, however, one witness does not include him at all, and the two other witnesses place him "approximately on the line but with his net still on the inside." Considering the distances involved, the angles of observation, and the fact that a previous effort to line up the two targets with the buoy, at the time they were first placed, was in error by a distance of 220 feet, and that it was this line rather than the true line which Rowe was "approximately on," we do not find competent evidence in the record sufficient to convict the defendant Rowe. The judgment as to him is therefore reversed on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed as to cases 33006, 33007 and 33009, and reversed as to the defendant Rowe, case No. 33008.
