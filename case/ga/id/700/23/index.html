Watkins Company, Inc., filed suit against Harold A. Strickland, R. H. Horne, William R. Simpson, and Elmo Brown, the administrator of the estate of Matthew A. Brown. The suit was based on a contract between J. R. Watkins Company, Inc., and Harold A. Strickland, the principal and purchaser, and the other named parties, whom we shall designate as the sureties. It was a contract joint and several against all parties. The provision of the contract was to the effect that J. R. Watkins Company, Inc. (hereinafter called the plaintiff) , was to sell to Strickland certain of its goods at a stipulated price, which goods Strickland was to sell or return. We will not go into detailed terms if the contract, for they are undisputed. It is alleged that the plaintiff fully complied with the terms if the contract. The suit was brought fair an alleged balance due of $778.53, besides interest.</div><div class="casepar">"1.

Through the action, negligence and laches of plaintiff, defendants have been injured and their risk, severally, increased in that the right of each to contribution from their co-surety has been lost.

Strickland reads:</div><div class="casepar">"Now comes Harold Ardel Strickland, defendant in the above styled matter within forty-five (45) days subsequent to the service of plaintiff's petition and having paid all accrued cost in said case, and subject to any pleas and demurrers heretofore filed, files this his answer to plaintiff's petition as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"1.

This defendant denies paragraph four (4) in the manner and form in which same is alleged and expressly denies the allegation that a balance of $778.53 is due from this defendant to plaintiff and demands strict proof thereof. Defendant further says that he is not indebted to plaintiff in the amount of $778.53 or any other amount and that said account has been paid in full by cash and the return of merchandise, either one or both.</div><div class="casepar">"3. This defendant admits the allegations of paragraphs seven (7) and eight (8).</div><div class="casepar">"Having fully answered, this defendant prays that he be hence discharged without cost on him, that all cost of these proceedings be taxed against plaintiff and of this defendant puts himself upon the country."</div><div class="casepar">The case proceeded to trial and the jury returned a verdict for $200, besides interest, in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. This motion was denied, the plaintiff alleging that the verdict for $200 was without evidence to support it, and that the verdict should have been for $778.53.</div><div class="casepar">Thereafter Strickland was called and testified as follows: "I do not know how much I owe them (plaintiff) -- in moving I lost all of my records. I think I owe them about $200.00 -- I don't know exactly. Cross-examination: 'I received (that) letter (plaintiff's exhibit 43) demanding payment of $778.53, balance owing them. (on being shown plaintiff's exhibit 2) I guess I signed that letter. I did not deny that I owed (plaintiff) $778.53 and promised to pay them -- . I sold merchandise on credit -- I still have about $200.00 owing me -- I think I owe them (plaintiff) about $200.00 -- I do not know exactly -- I (also) lost the records of accounts due me. So far I know I received credit for all payments made and all merchandise returned. I account for the difference, because the people I sold to owe me about that much. My customers owe me about $200.00. I received numerous letters from Watkins (plaintiff) saying I owed them $778.53. I did not write them denying that I owed that amount, I promised to pay them without denying the amount stated in their letters. I promised to pay on several occasions."</div><div class="casepar">After the verdict counsel for both parties stipulated and agreed as follows: "For plaintiff: (1) Original complaint filed 25 October, 1954; and (2) the amendment thereto filed 20 December, 1954; (3) ten days notice of intent to examine witnesses without commission with service thereon, filed 27 December, 1954; (4) motion for new trial, filed November 10, 1955; and (5) motion for continuance, with agreement of defendants' counsel and filed on January 21, 1956; (6) Motion for new trial, filed November 10, 1955; and (7) motion for continuance, hearing on motion for new trial, consent of defendants' counsel ad order of judge thereon, filed January 21, 1956.</div><div class="casepar">"For defendants: (8) The answer of defendants, William R. Simpson and Elmo Brown as administrator of the estate of Matthew A. Brown, deceased, filed 27 September, 1954; (9) the answer of defendant, R. H. Horne, filed 5 October, 1954; and (10) the answer of defendant, Harold A. Strickland, filed 5 October, 1954.</div><div class="casepar">"It is further agreed that all pleadings filed in captioned cause, other than the above listed, be and they are hereby stricken, so as not to encumber the record in said cause; and</div><div class="casepar">"That said cause proceed, as to motion for new trial and any proceedings subsequent thereto on the above listed pleadings only."</div><div class="casepar"> This record does not sustain the verdict of $200. Strickland, the only witness for the defense who attempted to establish the amount owed the plaintiff, stated positively in his testimony that he did not know know much he owed the plaintiff; that he lost his records in moving; that he believed it was about $200. The evidence of the plaintiff showed in detail the status of the account, and that amount was $778.53. The plaintiff carried the burden of proving this amount and was entitled to a verdict, according to this record. A verdict which is not supported by any evidence is an unlawful verdict and cannot be permitted to stand. There is no evidence to sustain the contentions of the sureties in their several pleas.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
