The evidence amply supports the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">2. The charge of the court of which complaint is made in the special ground was error in the respect pointed out in the opinion, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed with direction as given in the opinion.</div><div class="casepar">J. D. Norred, t/a Fayetteville Plumbing Company (now one of the defendants in error, hereinafter called the plaintiff), filed his suit on an oral contract against J. B. Bailey (hereinafter called the defendant), in the Civil Court of Fulton County, alleging that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of $315.85; that the defendant became obligated to pay the plaintiff $775.85, in consideration of the plaintiff performing the following services, to wit, the installation of plumbing and the furnishing of the necessary pipes and fixtures in certain identified buildings; that the plaintiff performed his said contract, and there is a balance of $315.85, for which the plaintiff brought suit, praying for a general judgment against the defendant, as well as a special lien on the said real estate.</div><div class="casepar">To the petition the defendant filed his answer and jury demand and demurrers, wherein the defendant denied the indebtedness.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff filed and amendment to his original petition, alleging that the original contract price was $650, instead of $775.85 as set out in his original petition, the difference being for extra work and materials the plaintiff sought to charge the defendant for in connection with the transaction.</div><div class="casepar">Cameron as co-plaintiff, and showing that Cameron was a partner of the plaintiff. At this stage of the proceedings the plaintiff admitted in open court that the total contract price was for $650, and that the difference of $125.85 was for extras. Upon a hearing, the trial court denied the motion on each and every ground. To this judgment the defendant excepts.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant denied every material allegation of the petition. The plaintiffs introduced evidence in substantiation of their allegations, and the defendant introduced evidence in substantiation to his defense, to the effect that the contract was not substantially complied with because the plumbing was defective in practically every particular, and in addition thereto the defendant had advanced $10 to one of the employees of the defendant, and $20 more to this same employee or some other employee of the defendant. So it is that the defendant introduced evidence that the work performed did not entitle the plaintiffs to recover anything on the contract and he is not indebted to the plaintiffs in any amount. After the charge of the court, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $295.85. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial and thereafter added one special ground. The court denied the motion for a new trial as amended. It is to this judgment that error is assigned here.</div><div class="casepar"> J. 1. As to the general grounds, while the evidence is conflicting on all material issues, it is sufficient to sustain the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">2. There were no special requests to charge. The special ground assigns error on the following excerpt from the charge of the court: "There is an issue in the case with respect to an alleged payment on the part of the defendant to someone for the plaintiff's of an additional $20. You remember that there was a pleading in the case, and evidence on the part of the plaintiff's that $10 was paid to one of the employees. The defendant contends that an additional $20 was paid either to that employee or to another employee, and in that respect, you gentlemen will have to determine an issue of payment. Now that is the only way in which you might adjust an amount in the event you determine that for the defendant and find in favor of the plaintiffs otherwise. [Italics ours.] "If you determine you find in favor of the defendant in the case, there will be no amount of money involved at all, so you won't need to go into that issue. Under the circumstances, if you should find in favor of the plaintiffs in the case, your verdict will either be in the maximum amount sued for, or in that amount less $20.00, which is the maximum amount of that contention on the part of defendant, with respect to payment, which would be $295.85."</div><div class="casepar">The movant avers that the charge is erroneous and was injurious because it was misleading and confusing to the jury for the following reasons: "That plaintiffs' original petition showed in paragraph one that the original contract price was the sum of $775.85, which defendant denied.</div><div class="casepar">"That plaintiffs' amendment later sets out the original contract price of $650.00, setting out certain other items as extras making a total price of $775.85. Defendant denied that he contracted to pay for the extras. The evidence showed on page 4, (Norred) that the original contract price was for $650.00 plus the extras.</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant denied in paragraph 2 of his answer that the sum of $315.85 was due plaintiff. Evidence was brought out on page 4 of report of the trial (Norred) that the defendant refused to pay for the extras and the balance of $315.85 which includes the extras.</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant avers that there was and is no contention or dispute as to the original purchase price of $650.00 but that defendant did dispute the bad workmanship, the extra labor, the extra materials, and the sum of $20.00 the defendant paid an employee of plaintiffs at one of the plaintiffs' request.</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant verily believes and avers that the court erred in its aforesaid charge in that same was confusing and misleading to the jury and injurious to defendant, that same was an unsound abstract principal of law, that the court erred in giving such charge (<span class="casemissing">135 Ga. 357</span>).</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant avers that he was entitled to have submitted to the jury his denial of the fact that he entered into an additional substitute agreement to pay for the extras. Defendant avers that he did not enter into such an agreement that evidence was introduced to show that same was in dispute, which the record shows beginning on page 4 of the report of the trial (Norred) and continuing throughout the trial.</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant avers that he was entitled to have this question as to the extras and substitute agreement submitted to the jury and by the charge of the court and the wording of the charge heretofore referred to and more specific the portions of the charge that is underlined, the defendant avers that said charge were prejudicial and injurious to him in that had the jury been able to consider the question of whether or not an agreement was made to pay for the extras, or whether or not same was a part of the original contract then their verdict could have possibly been very different. Calling the court's attention to plaintiff's amendment which shows the original contract price as $650.00 and certain extras amounting to $125.85 plus the payments made by defendant. Defendant avers that there is no dispute between the evidence and the pleadings that plaintiffs sought to have charged the defendant with certain extras, which defendant denied that he agreed to pay for, but that same was covered in the original contract.</div><div class="casepar">"This is a question of fact which should have been submitted to the jury. The court's charge prevented this question of fact from going to the jury and defendant avers that same was injurious to him; that the verdict possibly could have read some $125.85 less had this question been considered by the jury."</div><div class="casepar">We have read carefully the contentions of both parties regarding the charge of the court on this special ground, and we have read carefully the charge as a whole. From the record as a whole, we can discern no error in this special ground that would be cause for a reversal. The court in another portion of the charge instructed the jury that they would be obliged to consider the testimony on the allegations of the defendant to the effect that the $10 abode mentioned had been advanced and also $20 had been advanced as a payment to the same employee or another employee. Therefore, the record, according to our way of thinking, shows that the $10 payment stands on the same footing as the $20 payment. Nevertheless, the court instructed the jury that if they found that the plaintiffs here entitled to recover the recovery would be either $315.85 or $20 less than that amount. Just why the court did not, in this same connection, include the $10 payment as well as the $20 payment, we do not know, but the only error which we can find in regard to this special ground, in view of the whole charge and in view of the evidence, is that the court did not include the $10 payment as well as the $20 payment. If the court had done this, the only detriment which could have been inflicting upon the defendant is a credit of $10 which would reduce the payment by that amount. Under the whole record we are not of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed, but we are of the opinion that the defendant is entitled to get credit for the $10 payment. Counsel for both parties have submitted numerous authorities regarding this special ground, but as we view the case the defendant is not entitled to a new trial provided the plaintiff will write off the $10 credit from the judgment returned before the remittitur is received in the trial court. Otherwise, a new trial is granted.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed with direction.
