L. Council sued Sleep's Helpy-Selfy Laundry, Inc., for damages allegedly caused by defendant's negligence. The petition alleged in substance: that on September 1, 1955, plaintiff went to defendant's establishment for the purpose of laundering clothes and for which privilege plaintiff was to pay defendant; that defendant operates a self laundry furnishing said services for a consideration to be paid by persons using the defendant's facilities, and that upon this occasion plaintiff was an invitee of defendant; that defendant, in addition to furnishing washing machines for the laundering of clothes, also furnishes wringers for the purpose of drying clothes, which said wringers are dangerous instrumentalities, there being no way to shut them off except by use of a chain or string which hangs down behind the person using them; that said wringers have no switch on the machine itself with which to cut them off, and defendant on the occasion herein complained of did not keep some person close by the machine to assist anyone whose hand or arm might get caught in the machine; that, while operating said wringer in attempting to wring a piece of laundry, plaintiff's fingers were caught in the machine, and her whole arm was dragged through the machine before an employee of defendant finally shut off the machine; that as a result plaintiff was injured in enumerated particulars; that defendant was negligent in particular as follows: in failing to furnish an instrumentality that was in reasonably good condition and reasonably suited for the uses intended; in failing to inspect the machine and seeing that it was in good condition and safe for customers to use; in failing to have a switch or some means on the machine by which it could be stopped in an emergency; in failing to warn plaintiff of any dangers incident to its use or any defects in the machine; in failing to discover the dangers and defects in the machine and to correct them before allowing customers to use them; in failing to have someone to keep a sharp lookout while plaintiff and others were using said machine, so that it could have been stopped without injury to plaintiff once her fingers were caught in the machine.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff amended her petition by adding the following allegations: "That plaintiff had used said machines and wringer only once prior to the date of her injury and was unfamiliar with this type machine and wringer. That an employee of the defendant, who is unknown to the plaintiff but is well known to the defendant, started the washing machine and wringer for the plaintiff and the same employee showed plaintiff a lever on the left hand side of the wringer and told plaintiff that if the clothes became wrapped around the wringer roller that she could turn the lever and this would reverse the rollers so that the clothes would come back off the roller. That said employee in starting the machine and wringer pulled a cord which was behind the plaintiff as she operated the wringer. That the defendant's employees gave her no other instructions with reference to the operation and stopping of the wringer other than to tell her that by turning the lever the motion of the rollers would be reversed. That as plaintiff was drying her clothes two sheets came up to the wringer together and pulled her fingers into the rollers and as soon as this happened, plaintiff tried to turn the lever which had been pointed out to her but with the pressure of her hand on the roller she was unable to turn the lever and reverse the rollers so as to release her fingers. That plaintiff was also pulling her hand and arm trying to release them from the rollers but the great pressure of the hard rollers gradually drew her hand and arm into and through the rollers of the wringer as plaintiff cried for help. That defendant was on notice of the dangerous and defective nature of said wringer for the reason that there had been numerous other incidents where customers had their hands and arms caught in the same manner and defendant failed to provide its customers with any means of automatically or manually stopping the motion of the rollers of the wringer when a human hand became engaged therein." Such amendment added the following specification of negligence: in that the defendant failed to provide an automatic method of stopping said wringer when a human hand became engaged therein; in failing to adequately instruct the plaintiff in the operation of said wringer, so that she could have avoided the injury to her arm; in failing to promptly stop said wringer when the hand of the plaintiff was caught therein.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant's general demurrer to the petition was sustained, the action was dismissed, and the plaintiff excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> J. The plaintiff does not allege that her hand was caught in the rollers of the wringer due to some defect in the rollers or the machine. The only "defect" alleged was that there was no "means of automatically or manually stopping the motion of the rollers of the wringer when a human hand became engaged therein." The purpose of the lever on the wringer as alleged and as instructed by the defendant's employee was to reverse the direction of the rollers in case clothes became wrapped around the rollers. If the machine was defective and if the defendant was negligent, it was because there were no "means of automatically or manually" stopping the machine. On general demurrer the petition must be construed to mean that the defendant was negligent in not furnishing some manual means of stopping the wringer. The plaintiff alleged that the machine was turned on and off by the use of a string or chain which hung behind the operator of the machine. It is not alleged that such method of stopping the wringer was ineffective or that the plaintiff could not reach or use this means of stopping the machine when her hand became caught in the rollers. In the absence of an allegation that this method of stopping the wringer was defective or ineffective, or that she could not reach the string or chain when her hand became caught, she fails to allege that there was no means of manually stopping the macine. In the absence of such allegations, the other allegations of negligence are without merit because such acts or omissions could have been negligent ones only if the plaintiff could not have stopped the machine by use of the chain or string provided for that purpose.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer to the petition and in dismissing the action.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
