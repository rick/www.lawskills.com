February 24, 1955.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, P.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The court erred in denying the motion for a new trial for the reasons given in the opinion.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs in error (hereinafter referred to as plaintiffs) filed a petition against the defendants in error (hereinafter referred to as defendants), in which they asked for damages against the defendants in the sum of $13,000, for alleged wrongful interference with the plaintiffs' right to occupy and use certain premises located in the City of Atlanta, and other wrongful acts of the defendants.</div><div class="casepar">The petition as amended alleged: that the premises involved were leased by Naomi P. Estroff and Maxwell J. Estroff to Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., for a period of two years beginning April 1, 1952, and ending March 31, 1954; that the defendants purchased the property occupied by Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., and the plaintiffs purchased the business of Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc.; that the plaintiffs paid rent of $125, for the right to use and occupy the premises for the month of July, 1953, to Allan-Grayson Realty Company, agent of the defendants; that the plaintiffs were in the business of regraining zinc plates for off-set printers; that the defendants damaged the plaintiffs by negligently causing or permitting water to enter a portion of the premises occupied by the defendants, and thereby damaged certain zinc plates, the property of the plaintiffs; that the defendants damaged the plaintiffs by cutting off the water and electricity to the premises occupied by the plaintiffs; that the defendants refused to admit employees of the Georgia Power Company to enter the premises to restore electricity to the premises, and the water was not restored to the premises; that the defendants without authority entered the premises while the plaintiffs occupied them and seized and carried away a typewriter, the property of the plaintiffs; that they were in the process of selling certain machines installed on the premises by their predecessors, Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc.; and that there were no local buyers for the machines located in the premises, and it was necessary to obtain prospective buyers from distant localities. The petition alleged that, as a part of the purchase agreement between the plaintiffs and Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., the plaintiffs agreed to complete the work of regraining certain plates for customers of Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc.; that it was to the advantage of the plaintiffs to show the machines in operation to the prospective buyers, and they were attempting to do this; that the wrongful acts of the defendants in cutting off the water and electric current prohibited the plaintiffs from showing the machines in operation, and prohibited the plaintiffs from completing the work which they had agreed to do for Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc.; that the wrongful acts of the defendants in cutting off the water and electricity damaged the plaintiffs by preventing them from getting the full market value of the machines; and that they were damaged by being denied the use of the machines in production.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs further alleged that, after they occupied the premises, the defendant, W. M. Teem, Jr., came to the plaintiff, Syl. S. Schloemer, and requested that the plaintiffs move and vacate the premises, and at that time the plaintiff informed the defendant, W. M. Teem, Jr., that the plaintiffs had purchased the business of Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., and had paid rent to Allan-Grayson Realty Company for rent on the premises; that the plaintiffs informed the defendant, W. M. Teem, Jr., that the plaintiffs were attempting to liquidate the business of Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., and dispose of the machines, and the plaintiff estimated they would be able to do this in about forty to sixty days, and the plaintiffs would then vacate and move from the premises; that the defendant, W. M. Teem, Jr., did not disapprove of the plan; that the plaintiffs acted in good faith and attempted to carry out the agreement to vacate the premises in a period of time from forty to sixty days from July 1, 1953; that the wrongful acts of the defendants in cutting off the water and electricity damaged the plaintiffs by depriving the plaintiffs of the right to continue operation of the machines for the necessary period of time to finish the work the plaintiffs had agreed to complete for Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., and the plaintiffs were denied the use of water and electricity in disposing of the machines.</div><div class="casepar">The petition prayed for damages to the zinc plates; for the loss of services of the machines; damages for the difference in market value of certain machines in operation and without being in operation; damage for the loss of the typewriter; and punitive damages because of the aggravating circumstances described.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants answered the amended petition by denying most of the material allegations, but admitted that they had purchased the premises while Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., occupied the premises involved; that the plaintiffs occupied the premises during a part of the month of July, 1953; and that the water and electricity were cut off on July 25, 1953, to the premises occupied by the defendants. The defendants alleged that water and electricity were restored on July 27, 1953, at approximately 12 o'clock noon. The defendants, by way of further answer, prayed for damages in the amount of $707.10, and alleged that the plaintiffs damaged them by damaging the premises in moving heavy machinery therefrom, and that they were damaged by the plaintiffs leaving debris and trash in the premises. The defendants alleged that the plaintiffs failed to pay a water bill in the amount of $14.80, and that the plaintiffs owed rent in the amount of $32.24, from August 1 to August 8, 1953. The amended answer of the defendants asked for punitive damages in the amount of $500.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence discloses without dispute that the defendants were the owners of the premises which the plaintiffs occupied for a part of the month of July, 1953. It was undisputed that</div><div class="casepar">Allan-Grayson Realty Company was the authorized agent of the defendants to receive the monthly rent for the premises; that the plaintiffs purchased the materials, equipment, and machines of Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc.; that the plaintiffs contacted Allan-Grayson Realty Company, agent of the defendants, for permission and authority to occupy the premises involved, and Allan-Grayson Really Company authorized the plaintiffs to occupy the premises; that the plaintiffs paid Allan-Grayson Realty Company $125 as rent for the premises for the month of July, 1953; that the defendants received, accepted, and retained from their agent, Allan-Grayson Realty Company, rent for the premises for the month of July, after the defendants knew that the rent had been paid by the plaintiffs, and with knowledge on the part of the defendants that the plaintiffs were in possession of the premises; and that the plaintiffs were using the same machines which Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., had installed and used in the building, and the plaintiffs were performing the same work which their predecessors had performed. The defendant, Mr. Teem, testified that it was July 6, 1953, before he knew that Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., had sold their business, and that he discovered this fact by going to the premises in search of Mr. Allen, and on the premises was informed that Mr. Allen was no longer there. The vacating of the premises by Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., and the occupation thereof by the plaintiffs was done with such little change that the defendants did not know of the change for a period of approximately three weeks, from June 22, 1953, to July 6, 1953, even though the defendants occupied a part of the same building that the plaintiffs occupied.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence to show that the plaintiffs were operating a business of regraining zinc plates used by off-set printers, and were engaged in a business of this nature at another location in the City of Atlanta.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence to show that the plaintiffs were trying to sell the machines they had purchased from Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., that the plaintiffs were unable to show the machines in operation to prospective buyers because the defendants had cut off the water and electricity; that the machines in operation were graining 500 to 550 plates per day, and the plaintiffs' profit for the work was 30 to 33 cents per plate; that the defendants negligently permitted water to come in contact with zinc plates, the property of the plaintiffs, while the employees of the defendants were taking down water pipes at the premises occupied by the plaintiffs; that the defendants negligently permitted water to enter the premises occupied by the plaintiffs from water pipes upstairs over the premises occupied by the plaintiffs, and that the water caused damage to the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs never received any notice of any kind from the defendants, specifying a particular date on which the plaintiffs were to vacate the premises; that the defendants took a typewriter from the premises occupied by the plaintiffs and left a note stating that the typewriter was being held for the payment of a water bill for which no demand for payment had been made.</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Schloemer testified that, during the first week in July, 1953, he told Mr. Teem that he had paid the rent for the month of July; that he would vacate the premises, but it would take him from forty to sixty days to dispose of the machines or find some place to move them. Mr. Teem testified that on July 6 Mr. Schloemer told him that he had paid the rent for the month of July; that he told Mr. Schloemer he would not permit him to be a tenant, and that he wanted him to move and vacate the premises just as soon as it was convenient for him to do so; that he informed the employees of Georgia Power Company that he would contact Mr. Schloemer concerning the electricity having been cut off.</div><div class="casepar">No evidence was introduced to show that the defendants at any time offered or attempted to refund the rent paid by the plaintiffs for the use of the premises. On the contrary, the defendant, Mr. Teem, testified that he did not attempt to refund the money. There was evidence to show that the defendants not only ratified the act of their agent in accepting rent from the plaintiffs by accepting and retaining the same from the agent with the knowledge that it came from the plaintiffs, but expressly informed their agent that the plaintiffs had vacated the premises, and that the defendants were holding Southern Plate Graining &amp; Supply Company, Inc., to the obligations under the lease.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and the court entered judgment thereon. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial, which was later amended, and the trial court denied the motion. The plaintiffs have brought the case to this court to review that decision.</div><div class="casepar"> J. Since the judgment denying the motion for a new trial is to be reversed on special grounds, we will not discuss the general grounds, as the evidence may be entirely different on another trial.</div><div class="casepar">1. Special ground 1 assigns error on the following: "The movants contend that a new trial should be granted for the reason that, while Mr. Woodrow Tucker, a witness for the defendants, was on the stand on direct examination, the following occurred: By Mr. White: Q. 'I want to ask you this hypothetical question, Mr. Tucker: In this particular law suit where the plaintiffs are seeking approximately $13,000 in damages for several items of damage, consisting of loss of earnings or profits, loss on the sale of machinery, water damage to zinc plates, damages for taking and holding a typewriter, and punitive damages, and where it has been necessary to file defensive pleadings, including demurrers and it has been necessary to take the deposition of the plaintiff, Mr. Syl. Schloemer, and where it has been necessary to prepare the case for trial and to try the case for 1 1/2 or approximately 1 1/2 or approximately two days; what, in your opinion, would be a reasonable amount for attorneys' fees for representing the defendants in that suit?'</div><div class="casepar">"Mr. Fine: 'Objection, Your Honor; on the ground that that hypothetical question is irrelevant and immaterial for the reason that in order to proceed--'</div><div class="casepar">"The Court: 'Speak a little louder.'</div><div class="casepar">"Mr. Fine: (Continuing) '--to recover attorney's fees by a defendant's attorney, or a plaintiff's attorney, you must show that the litigation has been occasioned by reason of the other party being stubborn and litigious. There is no evidence in this case to this point that the plaintiff has been stubborn or litigious.</div><div class="casepar">" 'On the contrary, the only evidence that this court has before it, up until this time, is that the defendant did certain acts to force the plaintiff to vacate the premises and that under the testimony as it is right now, and as admitted by this defendant on the stand, that this defendant accepted rent for the month of July from this plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">" 'Now I say to Your Honor that that hypothetical question is irrelevant and immaterial, and there has been no evidence to this point leading to that point being brought into the case, and there has been no foundation laid for it.</div><div class="casepar">" 'Now I would go with my brother that he has alleged certain things in his petition. He has sued for it. But the proof is lacking as to the allegation.'</div><div class="casepar">"The Court: 'I am not at all certain at this stage of the case that I will submit to the jury the question of attorney's fees on either side of the case, but in the even such question does come before the jury, it would be necessary that there be evidence in the case on which, in the event attorney's fees were allowed, on either side, that the jury would have something on which to base the amount of the attorney's fees; so I will let the testimony into the record, though I may or may not, in the final instructions to the jury, submit that question of attorney fees on either side. By admitting the testimony at this time I am not stating that I consider that attorney's fees are a part of the case, but since they have been pled, and since the question may be in the case, I will permit the testimony to be admitted at this time.'</div><div class="casepar">"By Mr. White: Q. 'Mr. Tucker, will you go ahead, then, and express your opinion?' A. 'Mr. White, as I stated a few moments ago, I am in my fourth year of law practice and I would say that in a situation of this kind or in a case of this kind, that the attorney's fees would be worth anywhere from $400 to $450; somewhere in that neighborhood.'</div><div class="casepar">"The movants contend that it was error on the part of the court to admit the testimony relating to the reasonable amount of attorney's fees when no evidence had been introduced to show that the plaintiffs had been stubbornly litigious and there was no evidence to show that the defendants were entitled to any damages for attorney's fees.</div><div class="casepar">"The movants contend that the statement by the court was error for the record shows that the plaintiffs had not prayed for attorney's fees and, therefore, had no reason to introduce evidence before the jury as to reasonable attorney's fees and that the statement by the court was prejudicial and harmful to the plaintiffs for the reason that it was misleading and confusing to the jury for it led the jury to believe that the plaintiffs had prayed for attorney's fees and had failed to prove their case.</div><div class="casepar">"The movants further contend that the statement by the court was error for the reason that it constituted a prejudicial comment on the case by the court that was misleading and confusing to the jury for it led the jury to believe that if the court did not know whether or not attorney's fees were a part of the case, then how would the jury be expected to know.</div><div class="casepar">"The movants contend that the admission of the evidence over the objection of the plaintiffs made at the time that same was admitted and the statements by the court in ruling on the admission of the evidence was, and is, contrary to law, harmful and prejudicial to the plaintiffs and error is assigned on the same for each of the reasons pointed out herein and because of the error thus committed, a new trial should be granted."</div><div class="casepar">The assignment on this special ground shows reversible error.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 2 sets forth a conversation between counsel for both sides and the court's opinion as to attorney's fees or punitive damages to be considered in the case. There may be alleged in this special ground some inaccuracies concerning whether or not the court erred in stating that the pleadings did not show any grounds for recovery of attorney's fees, but might show some tentative pleadings and evidence may be alleged regarding punitive damages. We do not agree that the court said anything or did anything prejudicial to the movant on this question. We will not discuss the further question because it is not likely that the basis for the allegations of this assignment of error will recur on another trial.</div><div class="casepar">3. The gist of the assignments of error set forth in special ground 3 is to the effect that the court charged the jury there was no issue as to whether or not the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants was that of landlord and tenant; that is, whether or not the plaintiffs were tenants of the defendants. The court charged that this was not a question for the jury to decide, but that in the court's opinion the relationship of landlord and tenant was a matter of law for the court to decide under the record of this case, and the court instructed the jury positively that the plaintiffs were not tenants of the defendants, and error is assigned on this excerpt from the charge. In this regard, under all the pleadings and the evidence the court committed reversible error, because such question was a question of fact for the jury to decide and not a question of law for the court to determine.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special ground 4 assigns error because the court refused to give a special request to charge, to the effect that it was a jury question as to whether or not the relationship of landlord and tenant existed between the parties, because the evidence showed that the plaintiffs accepted the rent through their authorized agent during the period when the contract of rental between the landlord and the agent was still of force. Under the record of this case, such refusal to so charge requires a reversal. This was a question to be decided by the jury and not a question of law to be determined by the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">5. Special ground 5 is so nearly akin to special ground 4 and our ruling thereon, we think it unnecessary to go into further detail regarding special ground 5. Substantially, special ground 5 assigns error in that the court determined as a matter of law that the relationship of landlord and tenant did not exist, and did not submit this to the jury for determination on the facts. This special ground shows reversible error requiring a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">6. Special ground 6 is so closely related to special grounds 4 and 5 it seems to us that it would be useless to discuss it further. The trial court tried the case on erroneous ideas that the questions involved were questions of law which the court should determine rather than questions of fact, which it is the exclusive province of the jury to determine. The assignments of error on this special ground are meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">There are 12 other special grounds closely related, which we will not discuss in detail, but we are required to pass on each assignment of error and so will discuss each one generally.</div><div class="casepar">7. Special ground 7 assigns error because the court refused to give, under a proper request, a charge regarding tenancy at will.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 8 assigns error because the court refused to give in charge, on a timely written request, the principle of law concerning tenancy at will and notice required of all parties to terminate same.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 9 assigns error because the court refused to give in charge, after a special request, the principle of law as to the remedy given a landlord upon failure of the tenant to deliver possession of property at the expiration of his leasehold.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 10 assigns error because the court refused to give in charge, after a special request, the principle of law that a landlord may demand possession of property after the expiration of a leasehold, and the process for the landlord to follow to legally gain possession of the property.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 11 assigns error because the court refused to give in charge, after a timely written request, the principle of law as to the procedure to be followed by the landlord to gain possession of the property held illegally by an alleged tenant.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 12 assigns error because the court failed to charge, after a proper written request, the principle of law that, should the landlord enter upon premises held under a leasehold and perform negligent or wrongful acts which would render the premises unfit for occupancy, such acts amount to eviction.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 13 assigns error because the court failed to charge, after a timely written request, that physical force is not necessary to constitute eviction, but that duress and intimidation constitute an eviction, and further that the relinquishment of premises under such duress or intimidation does not constitute voluntary relinquishment of the property.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 14 complains because the court refused to give in charge, after a timely written request, the principle of law relative to the measure of damages in such instances.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 15, properly requested in writing but refused by the court, also goes to the measure of damages.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 16 assigns error because the court refused to give in charge, after a timely written request, the principle of law that payment of rent to an agent amounts to payment to a principal.</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 17 assigns error because the court charged as follows: "Now, members of the jury, as I instructed you earlier, and before argument began in this case, the court is of the opinion that there is no evidence in the case to submit to the jury on certain issues, and I am removing those issues from your consideration. In the first place, the court is of the opinion, and so instructs the jury, that the evidence in this case does not permit the presumption or the finding that the plaintiffs in this case were tenants of the defendants. In the opinion of the court, and the court so instructs the jury, the plaintiffs were intruders or trespassers in this property. Allan-Grayson and Company had no right, if they did, to permit the plaintiffs to come into this property, and the plaintiffs came into this property as intruders or trespassers and without permission of the defendants, and without complying with the lease which the plaintiffs' predecessor, the Southern Company, had with the defendants, and therefore since the defendants, Mr. Teem and Mr. Zell, made no agreement to permit the plaintiffs to come into this property and did not accept them as tenants, and--that therefore the relationship of landlord and tenant as between these parties never existed. And so a great deal of the plaintiffs' petition thereby will fall, and the court directs you not to consider that in rendering your verdict."</div><div class="casepar">Special ground 18 assigns error on the following excerpt from the charge: "Item 'b' for the loss of sale of two machines which the plaintiffs could not show in operation and production: That item is being removed from the consideration of the jury by the court, the court being of the opinion that since the relationship of landlord and tenant did not exist between these parties, that there was no duty on the part of the defendants to permit the plaintiffs to operate the machines at all, and that the cutting off of the lights or the cutting off of the water therefore could not in any way have damaged the plaintiffs. And so that item is being removed from your consideration. Item 'c': For the loss of the services of the machine in the amount of $6,000.00 is likewise being removed for the same reason. And Item 'd': For the difference in market value of the two machines of $4,500.00 is likewise removed."</div><div class="casepar">Special grounds 7 through 16 inclusive go to the failure of the court to charge, under such request as shown hereinabove. Special grounds 17 and 18 assign error on certain excerpts from the charge, as shown hereinabove. These special assignments of error are based on the fact that the distinguished trial judge tried this case on the theory that the case was entirely based on questions of law which the court should decide, rather than on questions of fact which the jury should determine. In this view we are of the opinion that the court erred in failing to charge, as requested in special grounds 7 through 16 inclusive, and erred in charging as shown in special grounds 17 and 18.</div><div class="casepar">We have studied this case carefully and we have no doubt that, under all the record of the case, the questions presented are questions of fact and not questions of law. Therefore, we have reached the conclusion that the case should be remanded for another trial. The court erred in denying the amended motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
