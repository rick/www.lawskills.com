December 3, 1954.</div><div class="casepresiding">QUILLIAN, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The verdict was not without evidence to support it.</div><div class="casepar">Thomas McDonald Corporation sued Roy Broughton, Elb Cartwright, and E. L. B. and A. Corporation in the Civil Court of Fulton County for breach of a contract.</div><div class="casepar">The petition was in two counts. In the second count it was alleged that the defendants jointly contracted with the plaintiff transferor and one Thomas McDonald to pay him the sum of $2,500 commissions for his services as a business broker in negotiating a trade between them, by the terms of which the defendant Broughton was to exchange his farm for the hotel business of E. L. B. and A. Corporation; that the defendants, after the plaintiff had brought them together, secretly consummated the trade between themselves, entirely excluding the plaintiff's transferor from the transaction; that Thomas McDonald was a licensed business broker at the time the contract was entered into; that Thomas McDonald transferred to the plaintiff all of his assets and choses in action, including this right to sue for the breach of the alleged contract. The prayers of the first count of the petition were for process, the recovery of $2,500 for breach of the contract, and $500 attorney's fees. The first count of the petition was substantially the same as the second, except that in the first count it is alleged simply that the defendants jointly agreed to pay Thomas McDonald for the services rendered them, that the transaction involved $2,500, and the usual and customary fees of a business broker handling such transactions was ten percent of the amount involved.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence showed that Thomas McDonald, operating a licensed business brokerage in Atlanta, advertised that he had a hotel for sale. In response to this advertisement the defendant Broughton called upon him and inquired about the hotel; it did not meet Mr. Broughton's requirements and there was no sale of the property. However, Mr. Broughton told an employee of Mr. McDonald that he was desirous of swapping a farm that he owned in Wilcox County for a hotel, and asked the employee to obtain one for him. Mr. McDonald, acting through the employee, contacted the defendant Elb Cartwright, offices of the E. L. B. and A. Corporation that own a hotel business located at a stated address and known as the Capitol Hotel. The corporation did not have title to the building in which the hotel business was located, but did own a lease of the building extending over a period of years and furnishings of the hotel. In the meantime, the defendant wrote a letter to McDonald describing the Wilcox County farmland also stating that he owned a farm in Crisp County. In reference to the Crisp County farm he wrote: "Cordele Georgia Dec. 15-53</div><div class="casepar">"Dear Mrs. Mulkey:</div><div class="casepar">"The farm I have talked to you about is not about close to Cordele--it is some 20 mi. off close to Rochelle in Wilcox Co--a little less than 400 acres--the balance 161 acres plow lands and the rest very fine pasture and wood lands. 3 acre lake--the pasture is watered by spring that always have water, this place was know as a Blue Ribbon farm, it is well fenced there are two good tenant houses--two poor tenant houses and good barn, it is mostly clay and sand loam--considered the best soil, has electricity and on good road with mail and school bus service It can be iregated from lake or springs.</div><div class="casepar">"This is a good farm for anything and is worth more than the hotel but I will trade but would not pay any difference.</div><div class="casepar">"I have 400 acres where I live--3 miles from Cordele--just back of the State Market, on paved road but I would have to have $35,000 for it this is a fine place with a half finished 50 x 40 house in a pecan grove, it has a pond and a large creek through it. Two good tenant houses--good barn etc on a main road. I paid $25,000 for it and have spent some $10,000 on it</div><div class="casepar">"After he reads these facts and wishes to come and see I will meet him any time. Yours, Ray Broughton."</div><div class="casepar">The evidence was in conflict as to whether McDonald undertook to bring Broughton and Cartwright together in reference to the trade of the Crisp County farm. In this connection McDonald testified that he did inform Cartwright that Broughton owned the Crisp County farm; that they discussed among themselves the trade of that property for the hotel; and that Mcdonald told him that he would pay him $3,000 if the exchange was made. Cartwright testified that there was no such agreement, and that throughout the transaction it was understood that McDonald did not represent him and was to receive no fees from him. He further testified that he did not recall McDonald mentioning the Crisp County farm, and that he did not undertake to negotiate any trade involving the Crisp County farm. Cartwright obtained from McDonald two written statements reading: "12/19/53. If Elb Cartwright signs contract he is not liable for any agent commission. Thomas McDonald." "12/19/53. If Broughton &amp; Cartwright deal is signed contract on Broughton farm &amp; swaps Capitol Hotel Cartwright is not to pay any commission. Thomas McDonald." McDonald explained these receipts by testifying that they were to apply only to the trade involving the Wilcox County farm; Cartwright positively denied this explanation.</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Broughton denied that he had agreed to pay McDonald commissions, but admitted that, had the trade of his Wilcox County farm for the hotel been accomplished through McDonald's efforts, he would have been obliged to pay him for his services. He positively denied that he had employed McDonald or any employee of his to sell or trade the Crisp County farm. His evidence was unequivocal that McDonald was not in any way concerned with the exchange of that farm for the hotel.</div><div class="casepar">The record contained no evidence of any contract having been entered into by the defendants jointly to pay McDonald fees. There was evidence that the right of McDonald to sue for breach of the alleged contract had been transferred in writing to the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar"> The plaintiff (plaintiff in error here) expressly abandoned all of the grounds of its motion for new trial except that the verdict was without evidence to support it. The ground is without merit; there was sufficient evidence to authorize the verdict--indeed, the verdict was demanded by the evidence. The plaintiff pleaded as a cause of action a joint agreement of the defendants to pay commissions for certain services alleged to have been rendered by its transferor to them all. Their proof tended only to show several agreements of the defendants to pay commissions for these services. It is elementary that one contract cannot be declared upon and recovery had on proof of an entirely different contract or contracts.</div><div class="casepar">The motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is predicated upon the contention that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on a quantum meruit. Suit cannot be brought for the breach of a contract and recovery be had on the quantum meruit. The court did not err in denying the motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Felton, C.
