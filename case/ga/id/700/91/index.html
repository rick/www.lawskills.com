J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The court did not err in overruling the demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">By special presentment the grand jury of Lamar County indicted James Hughes (whom we shall call the defendant). The grand jury charged "James Hughes of the county and State aforesaid, with the offense of--felony for that the said James Hughes on the 8th day of July in the year nineteen hundred and fifty-four, in the State and county aforesaid, did then and there unlawfully with force and arms did run and drive and operate a certain motor vehicle to wit: a Chevrolet pick-up truck, over and along a public road and highway in said county, to wit: the Barnesville, Ga. to Coggans, Ga. road, and upon meeting another automobile and motor vehicle occupied by Boyd Gardner on said road and highway, did fail and refuse to drive his said motor vehicle on his own right-hand side of said road and highway and did drive and run his said automobile onto and against the automobile occupied by the said Boyd Gardner, in wanton, utter and reckless disregard of the rights of said Boyd Gardner while said Boyd Gardner was on his right side of said road, and by the wanton and reckless manner in which he, the said James Hughes, drove and operated his said automobile, and while so doing, as a natural consequence of said accused's manner of driving as aforesaid, the accused, James Hughes, without any intention to do so, killed and murdered Boyd Gardner, a human being, so that as a result of the wanton and utter reckless operation of said motor vehicle by the accused said vehicle being a weapon likely to produce death, was then and there driven by the accused upon and against the automobile in which Boyd Gardner was riding did thereby injure and inflict mortal wounds upon the said Boyd Gardner from which the said Boyd Gardner died, contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof." The indictment is denominated on its back "Manslaughter."</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the defendant, before pleading to the merits, demurred to the indictment as follows: "1. The allegations contained in said indictment do not set out a crime against the defendant under the laws of the State of Georgia. 2. The allegations in said indictment do not set out the crime of voluntary manslaughter against defendant. 3. The allegations in said indictment do not set out the crime of involuntary manslaughter against defendant and said indictment should be quashed. 4. The allegations in said indictment do not set out any unlawful acts on the part of the defendant that would form the basis of the charge of involuntary manslaughter and said indictment should be quashed. 5. The following language contained in said indictment, to wit: 'in wanton, utter and reckless disregard of the rights of said Boyd Gardner' is demurred to specially on the ground that the same is a conclusion of the pleader and should be stricken. 6. The following language contained in said indictment, to wit: 'by the wanton and reckless manner in which he, the said James Hughes, drove and operated his said automobile, and while so doing, as a natural consequence of said accused's manner of driving as aforesaid, the accused, James Hughes, without any intention to do so, killed and murdered Boyd Gardner, a human being, so that as a result of the wanton and utter reckless operation of said motor vehicle by the accused' . . . is demurred to on the ground that the same is a conclusion of the pleader and no facts are alleged on which such a conclusion could be predicated; and further this allegation not being based on any alleged facts is inflammatory and highly prejudicial to the rights of this defendant and said language should be stricken from the indictment. 7. The following language contained in said indictment, to wit: 'and murdered Boyd Gardner' is demurred to on the ground that the same is a conclusion of the pleader and no facts are alleged on which to predicate this charge, and this language not being in an indictment for murder is highly inflammatory and strongly prejudicial against the rights of this defendant who is not charged with murder and who under the laws of this State is entitled to a fair and impartial trial, and said language should be stricken and the indictment quashed. 7A. Defendant demurs specially to the following allegation. Said vehicle being a weapon likely to produce death as same is a conclusion of the pleader, an automobile not being an instrument likely to produce death and this allegation should be stricken and the indictment quashed. 8. The indictment in this case is</div><div class="casepar">further demurred to on the ground that the same is so vague and indefinite that it is impossible for the defendant to ascertain the charges against which he is to be called on to defend and the same should be quashed. 9. The indictment in this case is further demurred to on the ground that it is duplicitous to the extent that defendant cannot ascertain the charges he is to be called on to defend." The court overruled the demurrers. The defendant excepts to this judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the defendant call our attention to Locke v. State, <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. 534</span>, 539. It is plain from reading that case that the only issue there was that under the bastardy statute, an indictment which fails to allege that the accused was the father of the child, was fatally defective; that issue has nothing to do with the facts in the instant case. Our attention is called to Franklin v. State, <span class="casemissing">85 Ga. 570</span>, 572 (11 S. E. 876). The only question involved in that case was, that the accused had been indicted for a simple assault, and after he had been put in jeopardy, the State without the consent of the accused entered a nolle prosequi on that indictment and reindicted the accused on the same state of facts for aggravated assault. The court held that, since the first charge for simple assault was nol. prossed after the defendant had been put in jeopardy, and that charge for simple assault was nol. prossed without the consent of the accused, the accused could not be indicted, tried, and convicted of an aggravated assault because it was the same transaction. Our attention is called to Johnson v. State, <span class="casemissing">90 Ga. 441</span> (16 S. E. 92). The indictment in that case was held insufficient because it did not set out the manner in which the poison was used. Neither of the above-cited cases has any application to the instant indictment. Counsel for the defendant take up in detail and argue for their contentions that the indictment in the instant case was insufficient as a matter of law. They call our attention specifically to that portion of the indictment which alleges that the automobile in question was a deadly weapon. In support of this contention, they call our attention to Huntsinger v. State, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 127</span>, 134 (36 S. E. 2d 92). During the course of its opinion the Supreme Court in that case stated: "An automobile is not per se a deadly weapon." In that case the defendant was charged with murder. The court held that, since an automobile was not per se a deadly weapon, malice, the deliberate intent unlawfully to take human life, will not be presumed as a matter of law. The defendant was convicted of murder, and the Supreme Court reversed the case, we think, properly. Counsel for the defendant call our attention to Henderson v. State, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 1148</span>, 1149 (39 S. E. 446). The only issue in that case was that the crime was charged in the alternative. There are no alternative charges in the special presentment in the instant case. Counsel for the defendant call attention to Cole v. State, <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. App. 179</span> (22 S. E. 2d 529). In that case this court said: "An indictment seeking to allege the offense of murder as defined in Code  26-1009, which alleges there was no intention to kill, and yet alleges that the involuntary killing happened 'in the commission of an unlawful act which, in its consequences, naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being,' and in so alleging employs language which alleges the equivalent of implied malice, does not subject the indictment to the demurrer 'that while said indictment undertakes to charge the offense of murder against J. H. Cole and alleges malice in the commission of the homicide, it distinctly expresses negative matters by alleging that the said J. H. Cole had no intention of killing.' " In our opinion that case does not sustain the contentions of the defendant in the instant case. Our attention is called to Henley v. State, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. App. 595</span>, 597 (2 S. E. 2d 139), and Isom v. State, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. App. 803</span> (32 S. E. 2d 437). The facts in those cases do not apply here.</div><div class="casepar">The indictment before us, properly construed, sets forth one offense, and one only, and that is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, for that the defendant left his side of the road and ran into the deceased on the deceased's side of the road, inflicting injuries on the deceased without any intention to do so. The mere fact that it is alleged that the defendant killed and murdered the deceased is simply the misuse of words which could cause no harm to the defendant. There is no malice alleged and none implied. In fact, the allegations of the special presentment do not authorize any construction except that the defendant, in the commission of an unlawful act by unlawfully violating the rules of the road, killed the deceased without any intention to do so. It is elementary that the criminal action and the name given do not determine the crime. It is the facts alleged that determine the crime. It is also elementary that words foreign to the clear allegations of fact may be construed as surplusage. Under the allegations of fact in this special presentment, reasonably construed, the crime of involuntary manslaughter is set forth, the acts alleged causing death without any intention to do so. We conclude that the indictment could easily have been drawn without using some of the expressions therein, but we can discern no harm which could result on a trial before a jury, with proper instructions from the court.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
