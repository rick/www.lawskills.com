Where both of two defendants in a given case demur separately to a petition brought against them, the demurrers are overruled, and, in a joint bill of exceptions filed in this court, they assign error upon the overruling of their separate demurrers, but it is made to appear to this court that, since the ruling to which exception is taken, a jury has found in favor of one of the defendants' plea to the jurisdiction, the assignment of error in the bill of exceptions, as to that defendant, is moot, and will not be considered by this court, and the writ of error will be dismissed as to that defendant. Almand v. Northern Assurance Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../712/48/index.html">87 Ga. App. 193</a></span> (73 S. E. 2d 101)</div><div class="casepar">2. A defendant may require, by special demurrer, that the plaintiff plead his case with such reasonable certainty and clarity as the status claimed by the plaintiff is susceptible of, and a petition which is defective in that respect is subject to special demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">On April 26, 1955, Mrs. John Oakes sued out an attachment against J. A. Wingfield and P. B. Wingfield, returnable to the August term of Superior Court of Jackson County. In her affidavit and in her declaration in attachinent, she alleged that the defendants were indebted to her in the sum of $1,000; that P. B. Wingfield resides out of the State, and J. A. Wingfield resides out of the county.</div><div class="casepar">The other material allegations of her declaration in attachment are substantially as follows: On December 4, 1954, P. B. Wingfield agreed to sell Clarence Simpson certain described realty together with the improvements thereon in Jacksoii County, Georgia, and Simpson went into immediate possession of the property. On January 24, 1955, Clarence Simpson agreed to sell the land to the plaintiff. The defendants, P. B. Wingfield and J. A. Wingfield, had taken out a policy of insurance with Continental Insurance Company in the amount of $1,000. This policy, No. S-4117, covered insurance on a shed located on the property in question. On or about February 18, 1955, this shed was destroyed in a windstorm and was a total loss under the terms of the policy. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendants had received the full purchase price agreed upon for the described land, P. B. Wingfield claimed the money that was due under the policy. The plaintiff and Clarence Simpson notified P. B. Wingfield that the proceeds due under the police belonged to the plaintiff, but P. B. Wingfield still refuses to relinquish his demand and claim on such proceeds under the policy. In order to force collection of the proceeds under said policy, the plaintiff on April 29, 1955, sued out a garnishment in attachment against J. A. Wingfleld and P. B. Wingfleld, which was served upon the Continental Insurance Company, through its authorized agent in Jackson County. The garnishee answered admitting the indebtedness to the defendant under the terms of the policy. The plaintiff prayed that she have judgment for her debt, that the proceeds due under the policy be applied to the payment and satisfaction of the debt, and that she have such other and further relief as to the court seems equitable and just.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants, J. A. Wingfleld and P. B. Wingfleld, demurred to the declaration upon various grounds. The demurrers were overruled, and they have brought the present writ of error to have that judgment reviewed.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the plaintiff in their brief of file in this court submit that, since the judgment of which complaint is made, a plea to the jurisdiction on the part of J. A. Wingfield has been sustained, and that, consequently, any question as to his liability is moot.</div><div class="casepar">1. Headnote 1 requires no elaboration.</div><div class="casepar">2. In this declaration in attachment, brought by Mrs. Oakes against the defendant, P. B. Wingfield, it is alleged, without setting out any of the terms of the agreement between them, that on December 24, 1955, Wingfield agreed to sell certain described realty, together with the improvements thereon, to Clarence Simpson, and Simpson immediately thereafter went into possession of the property. Without setting forth any of the terms of the agreement between them, it is alleged that on January 24, 1955, Simpson agreed to sell the land to the plaintiff, Mrs. Oakes. It is alleged further that P. B. and J. A. Wingfield had taken out a policy of insurance with Continental Insurance Company in the amount of $1,000 on a shed located on the property; that on February 18, 1955, the shed was destroyed by windstorm, and there was a total loss under the terms of the policy; that, notwithstanding the fact that P. B. Wingfield and J. A. Wingfield had received the full purchase price agreed upon for the property, P. B. Wingfield claimed the money due under the terms of the policy; and, that, although Mrs. Oakes and Simpson notified him that the proceeds due under the policy belonged to Mrs. Oakes, he refuses to relinquish his demand for, and claim to, such proceeds. It is further alleged that Mrs. Oakes sued out a garnishment which was served upon Continental Insurance Company through its agent; and that the insurance company answered admitting an indebtedness to the defendant, P. B. Wingfield, of $1,000 under the terms of the policy. In Bruce v. Jennings, <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 618</span>, 620 (10 S. E. 2d 56), the Supreme Court held: "It is the general rule that, where the purchaser goes into possession under a binding executory contract for the sale of improved realty which the seller is able to convey, but where, before the transfer of the legal title is consummated, the improvements are destroyed by fire without the fault of either party, the loss falls on the purchaser as the owner of the equitable title. Mackey v. Bowles, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 730</span>, 734 (25 S. E. 834); Bispham's Equity (5th ed.),  364; 27 R. C. L. 556; 66 C. J. 1052, 1053. If in such a case the property was insured by the seller, he holds the insurance money which he may collect on the bargained property as trustee for the purchaser, subject, however, to his own claims for any unpaid purchase-money plus the insurance premiums. Phinizy v. Guernsey, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 346</span>, 349 (36 S. E. 796, 50 L. R. A. 680, 78 Am. St. R. 207); Brady v. Welsh, 200 Iowa 44 (204 N. W. 235, 40 A. L. R. 603, 605), and cit. Godfrey v. Alcorn, 215 Ky. 465 (284 S. W. 1094, 51 A. L. R. 925); 27 R. C. L. 559,  298; 66 G. J. 1054, 1055 ( 815); Mehrtens v. Knight, <span class="casemissing">29 Ga. App. 390</span> (2b) (115 S. E. 506)."</div><div class="casepar">In Phinizy v. Guernsey, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 346</span>, 348 (36 S. E. 796, 50 L. R. A. 680, 78 Am. St. R. 207) it was held: " 'When a binding agreement is entered into to sell land, equity regards the vendor as a trustee of the legal title for the benefit of the vendee, while the latter is looked upon as a trustee of the purchase-money for the benefit of the former.' Bisp. Prin. Eq. (5th ed.)  364. This rule, however, is not applicable unless there is an ability as well as a willingness on the part of the vendor to convey, the purchaser not being considered as the owner from the date of the contract unless the vendor is prepared to convey a clear title and is not in default. 1 Warvelle, Vend. 195. In the case of Mackey v. Bowles, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 730</span>, it was held that if, after the parties had entered into a binding executory contract to sell, the property was damaged before the vendor was in a condition to convey, the loss fell upon the vendor and not on the purchaser."</div><div class="casepar">Under an application of those rules of law to the facts alleged in the petition, it appears that the plaintiff has not brought herself within the orbit of those rules. The terms of the agreement between Simpson and Wingfield for the sale and purchase of the property are not alleged. The terms of the agreement between Simpson and the plaintiff for the sale and purchase of the same property are not alleged. This information was called for by the special demurrers, and the defendant had a right to it, as the defendant may require the plaintiff to plead her case with such reasonable clarity and certainty as the status claimed to exist between them is susceptible of. Wright Contracting Co. v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../706/41/index.html">90 Ga. App. 548</a></span>, 552 (2) (83 S. E. 2d 232). The trial court, consequently, erred in overruling those special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">To come within the orbit of those rules, it must be shown that the purchaser went into possession of the property under a binding executory contract for the sale of the improved property; that the seller was willing and able to convey legal title; and that the loss occurred before the transfer of the legal title was consummated. This is necessary in order to determine whether the loss would have fallen upon Wingfield or Simpson, which in turn would be determinative of the question as to whom the insurance proceeds belonged. It is also necessary to know whether there were stipulations in the agreement between Wingfield and Simpson such as to vary the rules referred to above.</div><div class="casepar">As the case must be reversed because of the errors in overruling the special demurrers, the general demurrer is not now considered.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
