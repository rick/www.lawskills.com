Under such circumstances, the Medical Board established under Code  114-822 has no jurisdiction to pass on the medical questions arising under the claims. Code  114-819.</div><div class="casepar">The three claimants were injured by carbon monoxide poisoning inhaled over a period of a few hours while at their work on June 12, 1959. Agreements for compensation were entered into on the standard forms of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation, agreeing to pay each of them at the rate of $30 per week, which is the maximum allowable under the act for injury arising by accident. These agreements were approved by the State Board of Workmen's Compensation on July 21.</div><div class="casepar">On August 14 the insurer advised the board that it was stopping compensation payments as of that day, and requested that the cases be set for a hearing at the earliest possible date. On August 20 the State Board of Workmen's Compensation sent out notices for hearings. A hearing was held on all three cases, which were consolidated since they arose out of the same accident. The director announced at the hearing, ". . . the only thing to be determined then at this time is the disability." After this hearing, the State Board of Workmen's Compensation on January 6, 1960, issued a notice of award to all the parties at interest that the three cases "have been referred to the medical board for investigation and report as provided under the Workmen's Compensation Act of this State, Section 114-819." Pursuant to this notice, the hearing before the medical board was held on February 5, 1960, at which the parties appeared, previous evidence was reviewed by the counsel, together with the record of the previous hearing before the State Board of Workmen's Compensation. After further medical testimony, the medical board adjourned. The medical board rendered its opinion in each case on February 20, 1960, as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"The board finds evidence to confirm that the above claimant was exposed to and affected by carbon monoxide gas on June 12, 1959, at which time there were clinical manifestations of an acute carbon monoxide poisoning. He was treated medically for this condition.</div><div class="casepar">"The board has been unable to find medical evidence that the above claimant is now suffering from chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, or the residual effects from exposure to it."</div><div class="casepar">The discussion, attached to the opinion of the medical board, pointed out that the medical board could not find substantive evidence to support the contention that the claimants are now suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning; "The testimony mitigates against their having such a condition, and nothing whatsoever substantiates it.</div><div class="casepar">"Therefore, McCullough, Mintz, and Hopkins, according to the findings of the medical board, are not under the general provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Laws, 114-801: 114-803, in pursuing their claim to such disability."</div><div class="casepar">The claimants under Code  114-823 (3) then appealed the matter back to the medical board, contending that the medical board was without jurisdiction to enter a finding in the case, in that the injuries did not occur "as an occupational disease and the finding and conclusions of said medical board should be vacated and set aside. Said claim should be referred back to the hearing director for determination as by law provided." Pursuant to this appeal of the claimants, the State Board of Workmen's Compensation issued a notice that the medical board would have a further hearing on April 29, 1960. The defendant objected to the allowance of the appeal on the grounds that no legal grounds for appeal were shown as required under Code  114-823 (3), and that the claimant did not show wherein the decision of the medical board was erroneous, and that the appeal was grounded only on the question of jurisdiction, to which no objection had been made until this appeal was submitted. It was further charged that claimant acquiesced by joining the issue before the prior hearing on February 5th, to which no objection was made. The State Board of Workmen's Compensation overruled this objection to the appeal, and found that the medical board had jurisdiction of the case and that the deputy director did not err in referring it to the medical board for determination of the medical questions involved. The appeal to the medical board was heard on April 29, 1960, at which the parties appeared, the attorney for the claimants at that time reiterating his position that the board did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. Following this last hearing of the medical board, it issued the following report on June 25, 1960: "The medical board has been unable to find medical evidence that the above claimants are now suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning, or the residual effects from exposure to it."</div><div class="casepar">On July 1, 1960, the State Board of Workmen's Compensation, through the deputy director, issued a notice of award which, after reciting the prior agreement to pay compensation and the termination thereof, went on to find that upon consideration of the evidence submitted at the hearing it was determined that carbon monoxide poisoning and the residual effects therefrom is an occupational disease and is so named in Code  114-803. The findings went on to recite the finding of the medical board, and then concluded, "In accordance with Code Section 114-819 and the decision of the Court of Appeals in Griffith vs. Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Company, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../681/99/index.html">100 Ga. App. 157</a></span>, the Workmen's Compensation Board's only jurisdiction in this matter is to enter an award in conformity with the findings of the medical board.</div><div class="casepar">"Wherefore, based on the above and foregoing findings of the medical board, I find as a matter of fact that [the claimants] did on or about August 14, 1959, undergo a change in condition in that he [she] was no longer suffering any disability as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning or the residual effects from the exposure thereto on June 12, 1959."</div><div class="casepar">The claims for further compensation were denied.</div><div class="casepar">Following this the claimant appealed to the Superior Court of Fulton County, assigning forty-six grounds of error. After a hearing, the superior court affirmed the award of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation. To this ruling the claimants excepted on the ground that the overruling of each and every one of the forty-six grounds of assignment of error was contrary to "law, equity and good conscience, and the evidence."</div><div class="casepar">While forty-six grounds of error are assigned, the record reveals one which is controlling, and the only one which needs to be considered. The initial agreements between the parties for the payment of compensation found in the record and approved by the State Board of Workmen's Compensation are conclusive upon the issue of whether the injuries sustained by the employees fell under the Workmen's Compensation Law, Ch. 114-4, or the occupational disease statute, Ch. 114-8. These agreements were to pay compensation for an injury by accident, not for an occupational disease. Furthermore, from the facts in the record, it appears that the injuries sustained would have been governed by a prior decision of this court which held that disability to an employee caused by a disease which results from unusual, sudden, and unexpected inhalation of gas or fumes while performing the duties of his employment, where the disease causing the injury is not the natural result of existence of conditions necessarily incidental to the work being performed, is the result of an injury by accident and is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co. v. Lynch, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 530 (1)</span> (11 S. E. 2d 699). The facts here are very similar to those in the Lynch case, where the claimant inhaled welding fumes for several hours, resulting in edema of the lungs. Here, the claimants inhaled carbon monoxide for several hours resulting in claimed carbon monoxide poisoning from fumes of a gasoline compressor not ordinarily used. The compressor appears to have been used on this one occasion as a substitute for an electric compressor which would not exude the dangerous gas. Under the definition of an occupational disease as found in Code  114-801, the hazard in the present case was not due to causes and conditions which were characteristic of and peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, process, or employment of these employees. Code  114-803. The parties thus properly classified these as injuries by accident rather than as occupational diseases.</div><div class="casepar">Where an award of compensation is made under the Workmen's Compensation Act, whether by agreement of the parties approved by the board or by an award of the board, the sole provision of law for further consideration of the case is a review by the board based upon a change in condition. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Wilson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/61/index.html">215 Ga. 746</a></span> (113 S. E. 2d 611). "By entering into the agreement and allowing it to receive the approval of the board, the parties thereby preclude themselves from thereafter contradicting or challenging the matters thus agreed upon." Ibid, p. 752. Since the only further consideration in each case was limited to the possibility of a change in the award upon the finding of a change in condition, the statutory provisions for investigation by the medical board could not be invoked for the injuries of the claimants. The jurisdiction of the medical board extends only to claims for compensation for an occupational disease where medical questions are in controversy. Code  114-819. A reading of the final award shows clearly that the deputy director considered the findings of the medical board conclusive on the question of change in condition. This was error, since occupational diseases were not involved. The board's determination that its only jurisdiction in this matter was to enter an award in conformity with the findings of the medical board necessarily precluded the State Board of Workmen's Compensation from considering the other medical testimony in the case, some of which, if believed, might have resulted in a different conclusion.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Richard W.
