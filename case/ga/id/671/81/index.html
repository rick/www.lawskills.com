Peach Superior Court. Before Judge Long.</div><div class="casepresiding">JORDAN, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">W. Philip Mathews, as administrator of the estate of Audrey Kathleen Mathews, filed a petition in Peach Superior Court against Doc West seeking damages for the negligent homicide of Mrs. Julia Idena Pickard. The petition alleged "that on October 22, 1960, Mrs. Julia Idena Pickard, the mother of Audrey Kathleen Mathews, was killed in an automobile collision when the said Julia Idena Pickard was a passenger in the car driven by the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews and left surviving her one child, the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews. That the said automobile collision occurred in Houston County, Georgia, at about 3:50 p.m. and the said Mrs. Julia Idena Pickard was killed instantly. That the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews lived until 12:05 a.m. on October 23, 1960, when the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews died as the result of injuries received in said collision." The petition further alleged "that the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews had reached a point on U. S. Highway 41 about 5.9 miles south of the city limits of Perry and was proceeding north on the right-hand side of the road at a speed of between 50 and 55 miles per hour. As the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews reached the point on said highway above designated, the defendant, Doc West, who was approaching from the north toward the south at a speed of not less than 70 miles per hour, undertook to pass a car that was ahead of him going south and pulled out from defendant's right-hand side of the road and into and in front of the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews on Mrs. Mathews' right-hand side of the road and defendant's left-hand side of the road. That the left front fender and bumper of defendant's car struck the left front of the car of the said Audrey Kathleen Mathews and the impact being almost head-on; that at the time of the impact the defendant's car was approximately eight feet across the centerline on the wrong side of the road and was traveling at such a high rate of speed that the car of the defendant skidded 92 feet and 4 inches after the brakes were applied by defendant." The petition then alleged that Audrey Kathleen Mathews could not avoid the collision and that the sole and proximate cause of the collision and the injuries was due to certain alleged acts of negligence on the part of the defendant. The petition further alleged that W. Philip Mathews was the duly appointed administrator of both the estate of Audrey Kathleen Mathews and the estate of Julia Idena Pickard. To this petition the defendant filed general and special demurrers, the overruling of same by the trial court being assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar">The sole question presented in this case is as follows: When a mother is killed by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle and is survived by a daughter, and the husband of the deceased is dead, and there are no other children, and the daughter, who survived her mother, herself dies before she has opportunity to bring suit for the full value of her mother's life, is the administrator of the estate of the daughter, who survived her mother, entitled to recover for the full value of the mother's life?</div><div class="casepar">There can be no question but that when Mrs. Julia Idena Pickard died on October 22, 1960, her daughter Audrey Kathleen Mathews, then surviving, had a cause of action under Code  105-1306 for her homicide. Prior to 1952 this cause of action would clearly not have survived to her personal representative since the language of Code  3-505 applied only to actions which were pending at the time of the death of a party to such action. However, the General Assembly amended this section in 1952 (Ga. L. 1952, p. 224), to read as follows: "No action for a tort shall abate by the death of either party, where the wrongdoer received any benefit from the tort complained of; nor shall any action, or cause of action, for the recovery of damages for homicide, injury to person, or injury to property abate by the death of either party; but such cause of action, in case of the death of the plaintiff, shall, in the event there is no right of survivorship in any other person, survive to the personal representative of the deceased plaintiff, and in case of the death of the defendant, shall survive against said defendant's personal representative. However, in the event of the death of the wrongdoer before suit shall have been brought against him, the personal representative of such wrongdoer in such capacity shall be subject to suit just as the wrongdoer himself would have been during his life; providing that there shall be no punitive damages." The portion underlined above was added by this amendment and it was the clear intention of the legislature that not only an action but a cause of action would survive to the personal representative where there was no right of survivorship in any other person.</div><div class="casepar">In considering this amendment, the Supreme Court of this State used the following language: "Having held Ga. L. 1952, pp. 224, 225, constitutional as against the attack made, we come now to consider count 1 of the petition based upon said act. It is conceded, and of course it is true, that the deceased herself, had she lived, would have had a cause of action for pain and suffering resulting from her negligent injury by the defendant. But prior to the act of 1952, pp. 224, 225, this cause of action would not have survived her unless it had been commenced before her death. Frazier v. Georgia R. &amp; Bkg. Co., <span class="casemissing">101 Ga. 70 (28 SE 684)</span>; King v. Southern Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 794</span> (<span class="casemissing">55 SE 965</span>, 8 LRA (NS) 544); Stephens v. Columbus R. Co., <span class="casemissing">134 Ga. 818</span> [<span class="casemissing">68 SE 551</span>], supra. Under the above decisions and many more which could be cited, this court had held that only such actions under Code  3-505 as were pending when a person died survived to his administrator.</div><div class="casepar">"Clearly, the purpose of the amending act of 1952, pp. 224, 225, was not to create a new cause of action, as is contended by the defendant, but was to provide for the survival to the administrator of causes of action that existed in the deceased person before his death. We are of the opinion that the legislature could have had no other purpose in mind and that the effect of this amendment, as applied to the instant case, is to preserve the cause of action of the deceased, Mamie M. Floyd, and to permit an action thereon by her administrator." (Emphasis supplied). Complete Auto Transit v. Floyd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/68/index.html">214 Ga. 232</a></span>, 237 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/68/index.html">104 SE2d 208</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">This court has held that the 1952 amendment to Code  3-505 refers only to those cases where there is no right of survivorship. Keenan Welding Supplies Co. v. Bronner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../682/73/index.html">100 Ga. App. 400 (111 SE2d 140)</a></span>. The section is applicable in the instant case since there was no right of survivorship in any other person.</div><div class="casepar">We are therefore of the opinion that the cause of action which Audrey Kathleen Mathews had for the death of her mother Mrs. Julia Idena Pickard survived to the administrator of her estate, even though she survived her mother by only a few hours and was not living at the time the suit was filed.</div><div class="casepar">The right of action set forth in Code  105-1306 was created by the legislature in 1887. Code  3-505 was enacted two years later in 1889, and applied to all actions for damages for homicide or injury to person or property. The 1952 amendment to this section, while not creating any new cause of action, was clear in its intent that a cause of action once accruing to a person would survive to the personal representative upon the death of such person where there was no right of survivorship in any other person.</div><div class="casepar">The petition otherwise stating a cause of action, the order overruling the general demurrer must be affirmed.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Culpepper &amp; Culpepper, Geo.
