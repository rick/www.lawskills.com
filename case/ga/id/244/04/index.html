GM contended that it was entitled to freeport exemption as to such property from ad valorem taxation. However, the Fulton County Tax Commissioner ("Tax Commissioner") demanded that GM pay $510,379.99 in 1993 ad valorem tax on such returned property. GM paid the ad valorem taxes on such property. Subsequently, GM sought a refund for 1993 and 1994 and sued the Tax Commissioner under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span>. In the suit, GM also sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to freeport exemption in the future for such personal property.</div><div class="casepar">The Tax Commissioner answered, but did not raise an OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/19/index.html">9-11-19</a></span> defense of indispensable parties or the wrong defendant, in the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors, either in the answer or in an OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/12/index.html">9-11-12</a></span> (b) (6) or (7) motion.</div><div class="casepar">GM moved for partial summary judgment with supporting affidavits that the Tax Commissioner wrongfully denied GM freeport exemption from ad valorem taxes on the motor vehicles held at Atlanta Auto Auction for sale out-of-state. The Tax Commissioner presented no evidence in opposition and consented to the entry of partial summary judgment determining that GM was entitled to such freeport exemption.</div><div class="casepar">The case came on for trial on the issue of a refund for 1993 and 1994, and the parties announced in open court on February 7, 1995, that the case was settled. By trial court order, the case was removed from the trial calendar to effect settlement within 30 days. On March 23, 1995, the trial court entered a consent judgment refunding/granting a credit against future taxes based on certain ad valorem taxes for 1993 and 1994, and the Tax Commissioner was ordered to grant to GM freeport exemption from ad valorem taxation upon proper application for all motor vehicles at the Atlanta Auto Auction sold out-of-state in the future.</div><div class="casepar">On March 23, 1996, GM filed its freeport exemption application with the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/48.1/index.html">48-5-48.1</a></span> (a). However, on October 29, 1996, the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors gave notice of an ad valorem tax assessment on such property that GM contended was exempt under the consent judgment. Notwithstanding either the consent summary judgment or the consent judgment, the Tax Commissioner billed the ad valorem taxes upon such property, and GM paid the tax bill under protest.</div><div class="casepar">On April 11, 1997, GM brought an ancillary motion under the original complaint to enforce the consent judgment and for the award of attorney fees, with supporting affidavits. Subsequently, the Tax Commissioner raised by motion to set aside the judgments the issue that Fulton County could not be bound by the settlement, because the attorneys for the Tax Commissioner had no authority to enter into a settlement binding Fulton County The Tax Commissioner, for the first time, raised the issue that he was the wrong party and that the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors was the correct party.</div><div class="casepar">On October 13, 1997, the trial court entered an order of enforcement as to the binding effect and enforceability of the consent judgment as to the Tax Commissioner and denied the award of attorney fees to GM.</div><div class="casepar">The Tax Commissioner filed his application for discretionary appeal; the notice of appeal was filed on November 7, 1997, in A98A1694 when leave was granted. On November 12, 1997, GM filed its cross-appeal in Case No. A98A1695.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A98A1694</div><div class="casepar">The Tax Commissioner enumerates as error that the trial court granted GM's motion to enforce the consent judgment. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">1. After 1992, the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors were made the officials with whom the application for freeport exemption was required to be filed. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/48.1/index.html">48-5-48.1</a></span>; Ga. L. 1992, p. 2482,  1. For purpose of motor vehicles, their role in receiving the application is only ministerial as agents for the Tax Commissioner, who is the only official authorized to collect ad valorem taxes and to determine which property is exempt for the tax digest. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/103/index.html">48-5-103</a></span> (9); see generally Levetan v. Lanier Worldwide, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../233/7/index.html">265 Ga. 323</a></span>, 324 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../233/7/index.html">454 SE2d 504</a></span>) (1995).</div><div class="casepar">In Fulton County, the Tax Commissioner has the combined duties of the office of tax receiver, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/103/index.html">48-5-103</a></span>, and of tax collector, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/127/index.html">48-5-127</a></span>. In pertinent part, the Tax Commissioner has the ultimate discretion and authority to determine what property goes on the tax digest that he must prepare and submit to the State Revenue Commissioner for approval, and in doing so, he must ultimately decide what property shall receive ad valorem tax exemption on the tax digests. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/103/index.html">48-5-103</a></span> (9). The Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors acts as the agents for the Tax Commissioner in processing the freeport exemption.</div><div class="casepar">In appealing the wrongful assessment of motor vehicles, GM used the proper procedure against the Tax Commissioner to contest the assessment. See East West Express v. Collins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/8/index.html">264 Ga. 774</a></span>, 775 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/8/index.html">449 SE2d 599</a></span>) (1994); Blackmon v.

The Tax Commissioner stands in the shoes of the State Revenue Commissioner regarding assessment and valuation of motor vehicles. See Ga. L. 1967, pp. 91, 94,  2A; Ga. L. 1978, pp. 309, 491-492,  2; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/475/index.html">48-5-475</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors' ministerial duties in processing the freeport application as to motor vehicles are: (1) to determine if the application for freeport exemption was timely filed; and (2) to determine if the applicant falls into one or more categories for exemption. See Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. VII, Sec. II, Par. III (a); OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/48.1/index.html">48-5-48.1</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/48.2/index.html">48-5-48.2</a></span>; Apollo Travel Svcs. v.

App. 790</a></span>, 792 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../255/30/index.html">498 SE2d 297</a></span>) (1998); Committee for Better Govt. v.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span> provides that appeals from assessments as to motor vehicles are from the Tax Commissioner. See Apollo Travel Svcs. v. Gwinnett County Bd. of Tax Assessors, supra. Further, where the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors denied freeport exemption as to motor vehicles held for shipment out-of-state, this resulted in an assessment, and GM had the right of appeal directly to the superior court under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span>, which it did in the form of a motion to enforce the consent judgment. " 'Any owner who contests the value assessment of a motor vehicle . . . may appeal such assessed value as provided for in Code Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span>. . . .' OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span>. In subsection (e) of  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span>, provision is made for the county board of tax assessors to review the valuation of personal property and, in the event the challenge to the valuation is rejected, . . . [s]ubsection (f) of that section provides for an appeal to the superior court by the taxpayer[.] . . . Once that showing [of freeport exemption] is made, the taxing authority must make an appropriate [grant of exemption if the conditions of timeliness of the application and eligibility exist]. . . . [I]t is initially the county board of tax assessors and, in the event of continued disagreement, the [superior court] who must consider the taxpayer's showing and make appropriate [grant of freeport exemption if all conditions are satisfied]." East West Express v. Collins, supra at 775-776. "[I]t is the local taxing authority to whom motor vehicle owners must demonstrate [freeport exemption]." Id. at 777.</div><div class="casepar">The State Revenue Commissioner by law determines fair market value of all motor vehicles state-wide for "uniformity evaluation of all motor vehicles" and sets the assessment; the State Revenue Commissioner in turn sends suds prepared lists to the respective county tax collectors for collection, i.e., the Tax Commissioner. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/442/index.html">48-5-442</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/442.1/index.html">48-5-442.1</a></span>. "The statutory scheme for ad valorem taxation of motor vehicles provides that every vehicle owned in this state on January 1 is subject to ad valorem taxation (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/471/index.html">48-5-471</a></span>); that the State Revenue Commissioner shall prepare a uniform evaluation of vehicles for use as the taxable value of the vehicles (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/442/index.html">48-5-442</a></span>); and that the tax shall be at the assessment level and mill rate levied by the taxing authority for the previous calendar year. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/443/index.html">48-5-443</a></span>." East West Express v. Collins, supra at 775 (1). Therefore, a county board of tax assessors has no function or duty in assessing motor vehicles under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/299/index.html">48-5-299</a></span>, because this is done by the Revenue Commissioner state-wide. The only duty a county board of tax assessors has under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/299/index.html">48-5-299</a></span> is to investigate and to determine if motor vehicles are returned, returned in the correct county, returned in the correct state, or to apportion the ad valorem tax between states where the vehicle is used in interstate commerce. See East West Express v. Collins, supra; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/299/index.html">48-5-299</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/444/index.html">48-5-444</a></span> (a) (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/451/index.html">48-5-451</a></span>. None of such duties were applicable under the facts of this case. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/299/index.html">48-5-299</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/444/index.html">48-5-444</a></span> (a) (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/451/index.html">48-5-451</a></span>. Therefore, the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors had no duties in this case under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/299/index.html">48-5-299</a></span> in the original action in superior court.</div><div class="casepar">An assessment of personal property made in the manner prescribed by statute is indispensable to any proceedings to enforce the collection of ad valorem taxes. See Colvard v. Ridley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/34/index.html">218 Ga. 490 (128 SE2d 732) (1962)</a></span>; Hutchins v. Howard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../184/73/index.html">211 Ga. 830 (89 SE2d 183) (1955)</a></span>. "[A]ssessment when used in connection with the subject of taxation, includes all of the steps necessary to be taken in the legitimate exercise of the power to tax." Georgia R. &amp;c. Co. v. Redwine, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/89/index.html">208 Ga. 261</a></span>, 266 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/89/index.html">66 SE2d 234</a></span>) (1951). Thus, later, in sending the October 29, 1996 notice of tax assessment, the Fulton County Board of Tax Assessors acted ultra vires, because such ministerial function was placed in the hands of the Tax Commissioner by the State Revenue Commissioner by statute, and valuation and assessments were made by the State Revenue Commissioner. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/442/index.html">48-5-442</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/445/index.html">48-5-445</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/450/index.html">48-5-450</a></span> procedure provides a direct appeal to the superior court, avoiding the normal, slower appeal procedure for contested ad valorem assessments that now goes through the county board of equalization before going to the superior court, which factor of speed is a consideration in determining the applicability of tax appeal procedure. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span>; Ga.
