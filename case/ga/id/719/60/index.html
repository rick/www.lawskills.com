In the absence of fraud, a finding of fact that the injury, which arose out of and in the course of the employment, proximately contributed to the death of the employee, will not be disturbed where purported by competent evidence.</div><div class="casepar">2. In a contest between a regularly solemnized ceremonial marriage and a marriage founded on cohabitation and repute, the burden is on the one asserting the common-law marriage to prove every essential element thereof, including the fact that the parties were able to contract.</div><div class="casepar">3. Under Code  114-414, providing that a wife who has not voluntarily deserted or abandoned her husband at the time of the accident shall be conclusively presumed wholly dependent upon him for support, the fact that a wife, after abandonment by her husband, contracted a bigamous marriage with another does not in itself operate to exclude her from benefits under the act.</div><div class="casepar">These workmen's compensation cases, which were heard together, represent a contest between Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company and its insured employer, D. B. Thornton Co. and two claimants, Marion Reed and Pauline Eppenger Reed, each claiming to be the widow of the deceased. Willis Reed, the deceased employee, was involved in an accident on September 1, 1949, in the course of his employment when the truck he was driving hit a telephone pole. Reed continued working until September 9, 1949. On September 13 he was admitted to Grady Hospital. On September 16 a first report of injury was filed by his employer, stating that his wife had called and reported that he had two fractured ribs and a ruptured liver and was in a serious condition. This history was also given the hospital authorities and, based on a physical examination which disclosed marked swelling in the upper right quadrant of his body, they treated him for hematoma of the liver. An operation was performed on October 7 which disclosed that the liver was in an advanced stage of cancer, and the findings of the physicians differed as to whether the liver, which, unknown to anyone, had been in this condition at the time of the accident, had been further impaired by a blow received from the steering wheel of the truck. The employee died immediately after the operation.</div><div class="casepar">The claimant Marion Reed introduced a certified copy of a marriage certificate between herself and the deceased dated September, 1924. She testified that she and Reed lived together in DeKalb County and Atlanta, Georgia, until 1932; that she had two children by him, both now of age, and that in 1932 he began drinking, deserted her and the children, went to live with his mother, and never returned to her. In 1935 she entered into another ceremonial marriage with one Harry Smith, but testified that she had never obtained a divorce from Reed and had never been served with divorce papers, and that she had seen him from time to time since their separation and so far as she knew he had never left the State.</div><div class="casepar">Pauline Reed testified that she and the deceased entered into a common-law marriage contract shortly before Christmas, 1948, and that she had lived with him ever since but had never gone through a ceremonial marriage with him. On cross-examination she identified her signature on a statement obtained by an insurance representative which contained a statement to the effect that she had asked Willis about divorce papers and when he told her he did not have them she said she did not want to marry him. She denied having made this part of the statement, but admitted that they had quarreled shortly before the accident and The single director before whom the case was heard found that the accident in which the employee was involved was a contributing proximate cause of his death. This judgment was affirmed by the full board, and by the judge of the Superior Court of Fulton County, and is the subject of appeal in case No. 33661. The director also found in favor of the claimant Marion Reed, which judgment was also affirmed by the full hoard and the superior court, and is the subject of appeal in case No. 33662.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. Where the accident arises out of and in the course of the employment and is a contributing proximate cause of the death of the employee, it matters not what combines with it to cause the fatality. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. Adams, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 297</span> (28 S. E. 2d, 79); Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Meeks, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../725/98/index.html">81 Ga. App. 800</a></span> (60 S. E. 2d, 258). And where the findings of fact as to the cause of the injury are supported by any competent evidence and no fraud is present, such findings are conclusive on appeal. American Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Duncan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/38/index.html">83 Ga. App. 863</a></span> (65 S. E. 2d, 59). The employee here was undoubtedly suffering from a malignant growth which would have produced death within a short period of time. The original hospital examination and first report of injury both indicated a hematoma or rupture of the liver, but this should not he given any considerable weight, due to the fact that these reports were made based on a history of the accident and before it was discovered that the swelling of the employees body was caused by the cancer, which they were unaware of at that time. Nevertheless, one doctor stated positively that the blow should bring tension to the mass and cause a more rapid spread of cancer cells, thereby probably hastening the death by some months, and that it was therefore a contributing cause thereof. Another doctor stated that "had he not had the accident and come to the hospital he might have lived a week or a month or so longer or maybe two months." His theory appears to have been that the treatment and operation, rather than the accident itself, hastened the death. The director would have been authorized to find that there was no trauma and that in consequence the injury did not contribute to the death of the employee. There was, however, some evidence that the accident was a contributing proximate cause of the employee's death. The director having so found, and no fraud appearing, this court is bound thereby.</div><div class="casepar">2. As to marriages regularly solemnized between the parties, there is a presumption that they had capacity to contract, and of the existence of all other necessary facts to render such marriage valid, which presumption can be negatived only by disproving every reasonable possibility against the validity of the marriage. Reed v. Reed, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 508</span> (43 S. E. 2d, 539); Nash v. Nash, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 527</span> (32 S. E. 2d, 379); Brown v. Parks, <span class="casemissing">173 Ga. 228</span> (160 S. E. 238). To overcome the presumption of validity of a subsequent marriage which has been solemnized formally and entered of record, and which is as a result of such record accessible to the scrutiny of the world, there must be plenary proof that neither party to the previous marriage had obtained a divorce by failure to find any record of divorce in any of the counties of the jurisdiction where it should have been granted. Azar v. Thomas, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../197/00/index.html">206 Ga. 588 (3)</a></span> (57 S. E. 2d, 821). It has frequently been held that the burden is on those who attack the validity of a marriage to show its invalidity by clear, distinct, positive and satisfactory proof. Murchison v. Green, <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 339</span> (57 S. E. 709); State Highway Board v. Lewis, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. App. 162</span> (167 S. E. 219); Ward v. Ward, <span class="casemissing">24 Ga. App. 695</span> (102 S. E. 35). This statement was interpreted in Addison v. Addison, <span class="casemissing">186 Ga. 155</span> (197 S. S. 232) to mean that such burden is on those who attack the validity of a ceremonial marriage, the word "ceremonial" being expressly interpolated in the quotation, and it was there held that in a competition between a prior common-law marriage and a subsequent ceremonial marriage, the common-law marriage would not be entitled to prevail unless the parties thereto proved "every element necessary to the validity of such a prior marriage [founded on cohabitation and repute] by proving . . . that such alleged former spouse was single and possessed every other qualification for a valid marriage." Addison v. Addison, supra, headnote 2. See also Norman v. Goode, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 121 (3)</span> (38 S. E. 317). Thus, in a conflict between marriages, once a common-law marriage is legally established it is entitled to the benefit of every presumption which would arise were it a ceremonial marriage legally established (see Carr v. Walker, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 1</span>, 9, 52 S. E. 2d, 426), but in offering evidence to establish the respective marriages, the ceremonial marriage has the benefit of one presumption which does not attach to the common-law marriage, and that is the presumption that the parties were able to contract. Murchison v. Green, supra. If a common-law marriage is sought to be established, in a conflict between it and a ceremonial marriage, one of the essential elements of proof of the marriage contract is proof that the parties were able to make the contract at the time it was claimed to have been entered into, or at the very least, proof that cohabitation as man and wife ripened into a common-law marriage after the removal of a prior disability. This principle of law as established in the Addison and Norman cases, supra, was applied in Belle Isle v. Belle Isle, <span class="casemissing">47 Ga. App. 168</span> (170 S. E. 211) to a case almost identical with the case at bar, it being a workmen's compensation proceeding representing a conflict between a prior ceremonial marriage and a subsequent marriage founded on cohabitation and repute, that is, a common-law marriage. The court there held in a well-reasoned opinion that, the former ceremonial marriage having been proved, and in having been shown that both parties to the second attempted marriage knew of the existence of the first marriage and that the first wife was still alive, the second alleged wife was not entitled to rely upon a mere presumption in support of her common-law marriage to the effect that the previous ceremonial marriage had been dissolved by divorce. We consider this a sound rule of law. The claimant here, Pauline Reed, was aware at the time she attempted to enter into a common-law marriage with the deceased that his wife by a former marriage was still</div><div class="casepar">in life, and, if her statement to the insurance company is to be considered, she was also aware that he had no divorce papers. Regardless of this, however, since she did not enter into any regularly solemnized ceremonial marriage she is not entitled to the benefit of the presumption that the former marriage terminated in divorce. Rather as an element of proof of her marriage contract, she had the burden of showing that she and the deceased labored under no disability at the time they entered into their marriage contract. This she was unable to do. As a result she failed to prove a valid marriage to the deceased, and the judgment of the Board of Workmen's Compensation excluding her from benefits in case No. 33662 must be affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">What has been stated regarding the elements of proof of common-law marriage is here confined to cases involving a conflict of marriages, as it is not within the purview of this decision to express any opinion on the elements of proof necessary where no issue is raised as to the contractual ability of the parties in this respect.</div><div class="casepar">3. "In those States which have included the conclusive-presumption clause in their workmen's compensation acts, in cases where the claimant has been abandoned by her husband through no fault of her own and later she is guilty of adultery or bigamous marriage, this conduct will not bar a recovery of compensation . . . We think that the principle in this kind of case is analogous to the law of descent and distribution, and we know of no law which bars the right of a wife to inherit from her husband by reason of her adultery or bigamous marriage." Williams v. American Mutual Liability Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">72 Ga. App. 205 (2)</span>, 208 (33 S. E. 2d, 451). The evidence in this case was sufficient to support a finding that Marion Reed, the widow claimant, was abandoned by her husband without cause. This being so, the fact that she later entered into a bigamous marriage with another is not of itself sufficient to bar her from benefits under the act. The judge of the Superior Court of Fulton County did not err in affirming the award of the Board of Workmen's Compensation in favor of Marion Reed in case No. 33661.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Hugh C.
