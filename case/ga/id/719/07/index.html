R. Smith. March 22, 1951.</div><div class="casepresiding">SUTTON, C. J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. Where a distress warrant is sued out before a justice of the peace in a county and it is alleged in the affidavit that the defendant is a resident of such county, and where the defendant by his counter-affidavit, which also states that he is of such county, pleads to the merits without protestation as to jurisdiction, or without simultaneously pleading as to it, he thereby submits himself to the jurisdiction of the superior court of such county to which the warrant has been properly returned, and his plea to the jurisdiction or written motion, thereafter made, to transfer the case to the superior court of another county, comes too late.</div><div class="casepar">2. Accordingly, it was not error for the court to refuse to transfer the case to the superior court of another county, which the defendant in his plea or motion contended was the county of his residence, and the trial judge did not err in sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendant's plea or motion to transfer, or in directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">George E. Johnston sued out a distress warrant against W. H. Foy, before a justice of the peace in Dougherty County on December 29, 1950, for $280 rent, and the warrant was levied on certain property of the defendant in Dougherty County on the day it was issued. The defendant, on the same date, filed with the levying officer a counter-affidavit denying that the rent was due, and said officer returned the papers to the Superior Court of Dougherty County. The affidavit upon which the warrant was issued and the counter-affidavit were both headed, "Dougherty County," and both referred to the defendant as "of said county." The defendant appeared at the first term of the Superior Court of Dougherty County, which convened on the 19th day of March, 1951, and on that day filed a written motion or plea to the effect that he was a resident of Worth County at the time the distress warrant was sued out against him and had been ever since that time and long before, and that Worth Superior Court, in the county of his residence, has jurisdiction of the issue involved and moved the court to transfer all of the pleadings in said case to Worth Superior Court for trial. The Judge of the Superior Court of Dougherty County passed an order on March 19, 1951, transferring the case to the Superior Court of Worth County, and then two days later, on March 21st, upon motion of the plaintiff, vacated and set aside the order transferring the case to Worth Superior Court. Thereupon the defendant renewed his motion to transfer the case and testified that he was a resident of Worth County before and at the time the distress warrant was sued out and was still a resident of that county. The plaintiff then filed a general demurrer to the motion to transfer the case on the ground that the defendant, on December 29, 1950, had filed a plea or counter-affidavit to the merits of the case and thereby submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court. The demurrer was sustained, and the motion to transfer the case was stricken. The defendant then offered to amend his counter-affidavit filed December 29, 1950, by striking therefrom the words "of said county," alleging that said words were inserted in the counter-affidavit through error of his counsel and were not noticed by him, and by further alleging that the defendant did not reside in Dougherty County, but that he was a resident of Worth County before, at the time and since the distress warrant was sued out against him. The amendment was disallowed. The plaintiff testified that the defendant was indebted to him in the sum of $280 for rent as claimed in the distress warrant, and further testified that he did not deny the testimony of W. H. Foy that he had heard a few minutes before on the motion to transfer that W. H. Foy was a resident of Worth County at the time the distress warrant was sued out and levied. The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed in the distress warrant.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant excepted, assigning error upon (a) the order vacating the order of transfer; (b) the order sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer and dismissing the motion to transfer; (c) the order refusing to allow the amendment to the defendant's counter-affidavit; (d) the direction of a verdict and entering judgment thereon; and (e) the refusal of the court to transfer the case to Worth Superior Court.</div><div class="casepar">(After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. The controlling question here presented is whether the case should have been transferred by the Judge of the Superior Court of Dougherty County to the Superior Court of Worth County, and counsel for both parties have directed their arguments to this question.</div><div class="casepar">A distress warrant for rent due may be sued out before a justice of the peace in the county where the debtor may reside or where his property may be found, and executed, as provided for by Code  61-402. "The party distrained may in all cases replevy the property so distrained, by making oath that the sum or some part thereof distrained for is not due, and giving security for the eventual condemnation money; and in such case the levying officer shall return the same to the court having cognizance thereof, which shall be tried by a jury as provided for in the trial of claims . . ." Code,  61-404.</div><div class="casepar">The affidavit upon which the distress warrant here issued is headed, "Georgia, Dougherty County," and in the body of the affidavit it is alleged that "W. H. Foy of said county" is justly indebted to the affiant in the sum of $280 for rent. The distress warrant was levied by a deputy sheriff upon certain property of the defendant in Dougherty County, and the defendant's counter-affidavit thereto is as follows: "Georgia, Dougherty County.</div><div class="casepar">"Personally appeared W. H. Foy of said county, defendant in a certain distress warrant for $280.00 lately issued by J. W. Walters, J. P., Dougherty County, Georgia, in favor of George E. Johnston and on oath says that the sum distrained for is not due. [signed] W. H. Foy."</div><div class="casepar">The affidavit, the distress warrant, the levy and the counter-affidavit are all dated December 29, 1950, and the levying officer properly returned these papers to the Superior Court of Dougherty County, instead of to the justice court to which the warrant was made returnable, as the amount distrained for was beyond the jurisdiction of the justice court. It unquestionably appears from the face of the pleadings, when the return was made by the levying officer, that the Superior Court of Dougherty County had jurisdiction to try the case. The distress warrant on one side and the counter-affidavit on the other both referred to the defendant as being of Dougherty County. But the defendant appeared at the first term of said court and made application by written motion, supported by evidence, for the case to be transferred to the Superior Court of Worth County, it being contended by the defendant that he was a resident of Worth County, and that the case should be tried in the county of his residence.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff contended that the defendant could not at that time raise the question of the jurisdiction of Dougherty Superior Court to try the ease as he had already pleaded to the merits of the case by his counter-affidavit, without raising the question of jurisdiction, and consequently he had waived such question. Code  81-503 provides: "If a defendant shall appear and plead to the merits, without pleading to the jurisdiction, and without excepting thereto, he shall thereby admit the jurisdiction of the court."</div><div class="casepar">"Where after levy the progress of a distress warrant is arrested by counter-affidavit denying that the sum distrained for is due, the warrant becomes mesne process, and the proceeding is converted into a suit for the rent. [Citations.] Such counter-affidavit is a plea to the merits. See Hawkins v. Collier, <span class="casemissing">101 Ga. 145 (2)</span> [28 S. E. 632], and cit. 'After a plea to the merits a defendant can make no objection to the manner by which he has been brought into court.' " Brooke v. Augusta Warehouse &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 946</span> (47 S. E. 341). Also, see Berry v. Watkins, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 304 (1)</span> (123 S. E. 102), and Black v. Milner Hotels Inc., <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 828</span>, 831 (22 S. E. 2d, 780). The distress warrant operates as the declaration and the counter-affidavit as the plea. Swain v. Nasworthy, <span class="casemissing">2 Ga. App. 253 (2)</span> (58 S. E. 492). And where, as here, the distress warrant alleged that the defendant was a resident of Dougherty County, and the defendant by his counter-affidavit, which also stated that he was of Dougherty County, pleaded to the merits without protestation as to jurisdiction, or without simultaneously pleading as to it, he thereby submitted himself to the jurisdiction of Dougherty Superior Court, and his plea to the jurisdiction or written motion to transfer thereafter made came too late.</div><div class="casepar">FELTON, J., concurring specially. I do not agree with the majority that the filing of a counter-affidavit to a distress warrant waives jurisdictional questions for the reason that the only provision for arresting distress proceedings is the filing of a counter-affidavit alleging that the sum distrained for or a part thereof is not due. Not until this is done do the proceedings become a case in court wherein demurrers or special pleas can be filed. There can be no waiver of jurisdiction in the absence of a choice which could result in a waiver. I concur in the judgment because the effect of the defendant's motion was a plea to the jurisdiction which failed to allege that the defendant did not own property in Dougherty County. See Kimball Co. v. Rogers, <span class="casemissing">17 Ga. App. 562</span> (87 S. E. 848).</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Durden &amp; Durden, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">E. L.
