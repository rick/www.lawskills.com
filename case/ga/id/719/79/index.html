At the close of the plaintiff's evidence, the defendant moved for a nonsuit; the trial judge granted the motion, and the plaintiff excepted.</div><div class="casepar">The Code,  105-1801, provides: "In every case of tort, if the defendant was authorized by law to do the act complained of, he may plead the same as a justification; by such plea he admits the act to be done, and shall be entitled to all the privileges of one holding the affirmative of the issue; but such plea shall not give to the defendant the right to open and conclude the argument before the jury, unless it shall be filed before the plaintiff submits any evidence to the jury trying the case."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant in his plea and answer admitted the allegations that he made the affidavit charging the plaintiff with attempted burglary; that a warrant for the plaintiff's arrest issued; that the plaintiff was arrested and imprisoned under said warrant; and that the plaintiff was released from jail without trial or bond, the prosecution against him having been abandoned. The plea further sets out that the prosecution of the plaintiff was not maliciously carried on and that the defendant acted with probable cause, believing that the plaintiff was guilty as charged, and acted with the intention of having justice alone to those who had attempted to burglarize his store building, such circumstances justifying his conduct insofar as the plaintiff was concerned. This was a plea of justification. Rigden v. Jordan &amp; Stewart, <span class="casemissing">81 Ga. 668</span> (7 S. E. 857); Horton v. Pintchunck, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 355</span> (35 S. E. 663); South Georgia Grocery Co. v. Banks, <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 1</span>, 6 (182 S. E. 61). By such a plea, filed before the introduction of evidence by the plaintiff, the defendant assumed the burden of proving the existence of probable cause and sustaining his plea of justification. Rigden v. Jordan &amp; Stewart, supra. But the defendant, having admitted a prima facie case for the plaintiff (Baldwin v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">188 Ga. 587</span>, 590 (3), 4 S. E. 2d, 458; Central of Ga. Ry. Co. v. Morgan, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 168</span>, 35 S. E. 345; Williams v. McCranie, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 693</span>, 699, 109 S. E. 699), failed to introduce any evidence at all in support of his plea and answer, and the plaintiff proceeded to introduce evidence substantially as follows. The defendant told the justice of the peace that he detected somebody at the store trying to break in a window. The defendant said there were three of them there, but he didn't recall anyone s name especially. The plaintiff did not have anything to do with attempting to break in the store, although he remembered the night when the attempt was made, it was the night of a rain and wind storm. The plaintiff had come home from Atlanta with some of his brothers and cousins, two of whom were tried and convicted for breaking in the store. The plaintiff did not ride around any that night, but stayed at home, and he did not ask three of his brothers and cousins where they were going when they left home. The plaintiff had lived in the community all his life, as had the defendant, and the plaintiff had often sold the defendant fish at night, sometimes at midnight, in company with his brothers.</div><div class="casepar">It cannot be said as a matter of law that this evidence was such as to defeat the plaintiff's right to recover, where the defendant by his pleading had admitted a prima facie case for the plaintiff, and in these circumstances it was error for the court to grant a nonsuit.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
