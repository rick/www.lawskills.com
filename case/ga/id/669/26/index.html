An execution issued pursuant to an affidavit to foreclose a conditional-sale contract is not such a final judgment as cannot be challenged by an affidavit of illegality.</div><div class="casepar">2. Affidavits of illegality alleging that an insurer, not a party to the conditional-sale contracts sought to be foreclosed, was liable to the vendor for payments under the terms of the disability insurance policies, raised no valid defense to the executions, and the court erred in overruling the demurrers to the affidavits.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in error, assignee of three conditional-sale contracts, filed affidavits to foreclose the same in Douglas Superior Court. Pursuant to executions issued by the clerk of said court, the three vehicles were levied upon. The defendants in error, conditional-sale vendees, filed affidavits of illegality in which they alleged that they were not indebted to the plaintiff below in the amounts claimed because under the terms of disability insurance policies, issued to them as agreed in the original conditional-sale contracts, the insurer, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, had become liable for the balance of the monthly payments after the defendants became totally disabled; that, in accordance with the terms of the policies, the defendants had notified the plaintiff of such total disability and had furnished the plaintiff, at its request, proof of the disability.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant Hall alleged in his affidavit that his total disability began on July 25, 1960, and had continued until the date of his affidavit. Defendant Fowler alleged in his affidavit that he had been totally disabled from December 29, 1959, to June 1, 1960, and that the plaintiff had refused his demand for settlement under the insurance policies. In one affidavit the balance on one contract was admitted to be $885.29, afar assertion of claimed setoffs of $394.65 (the amount payable under the policy), $98.66 (25% of the amount of money owed by the insurer under former Code  56-706) and $200 (attorney's fee). In the other affidavit defendant Fowler made a counter-claim of $337.81, composed of $84.50 (alleged overpayment to the plaintiff), $53.31 (liquidated damages under former Code  56-706) and $200 (attorney's fee), and prayed that the plaintiff be required to surrender the mortgage sought to be foreclosed and the same be marked satisfied of record.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff's general and special demurrers to the affidavits of illegality were overruled, to which judgments he excepts.</div><div class="casepar">1. The first question before this court is whether or not the defendants below, as conditional-sale vendees, could challenge the legality of the foreclosure proceedings by affidavits of illegality filed after executions based upon the plaintiff's affidavits of foreclosure had been issued and levies made thereon.</div><div class="casepar">Code  67-801 provides: "When an execution shall issue upon the foreclosure of a mortgage on personal property, as herein before directed, the mortgagor or his special agent may file his affidavit of illegality to such execution, in which affidavit he may set up and avail himself of any defense which he might have set up, according to law, in an ordinary suit upon the demand secured by the mortgage, and which goes to show, that the amount claimed is not due." This Code section establishes the statutory right of the defendants below to file their affidavits of illegality to the executions.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in error contends that the case of Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp. v. Pritchett, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../672/81/index.html">104 Ga. App. 422 (121 SE2d 793)</a></span> is authority for the proposition that the issuance of execution upon an affidavit to foreclose is a judgment or proceeding behind which an affidavit of illegality to the execution may not go. An examination of the record in the Pritchett case, the material facts of which are identical to those in the case at bar, reveals that the "judgment of foreclosure" does indeed refer to the issuance of the execution. If this be the holding in the Pritchett case, it is directly contra to the clear provision of Code  67-801 that the mortgagor may file his affidavit of illegality to an execution "when an execution shall issue . . . ," and should not be followed here.</div><div class="casepar">The Pritchett case, supra, cites three cases as authority for the proposition that, after a judgment of foreclosure, it is too late to raise such a defense (the same as that raised in the case at bar) by affidavit of illegality. Each of these cases is distinguishable from the situation in both the Pritchett case and the cases before us now. In Allen v. Duval Motor Co., <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 336 (136 SE 479)</span>, and Hamilton v. Hamilton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../726/33/index.html">80 Ga. App. 750 (57 SE2d 301)</a></span> the executions to which the court refused to allow the filing of affidavits of illegality were issued pursuant to actual judgments rendered by a court after the defendants had had their day in court. In Tanner v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">183 Ga. 53 (187 SE 625)</span>, the court held that after an execution had proceeded to the extent of a sale of the property levied on, the execution and delivery of a deed to the realty by the sheriff, and the application of the proceeds of the sale toward the payment of the amount due on the execution, there was no proceeding on the execution to be arrested, therefore the questions raised by the affidavit of illegality, the purpose of which being to arrest an execution which is proceeding illegally, had become moot. In three other cases cited in the Pritchett case to support the statement that "an affidavit of illegality may not go behind the judgment or other proceeding upon which the fi. fa. is based," namely: Duvall v. Barron, <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. App. 304 (80 SE 701)</span>, Childs v. State Bank of Chicago, <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 533 (121 SE 254)</span> and Courson v. Manufacturers Finance Corp., <span class="casemissing">41 Ga. App. 551 (153 SE 624)</span>, the judgments of foreclosure were rendered after adversary proceedings, not merely after summary executions based on the plaintiffs' affidavits of foreclosure.</div><div class="casepar">Judge Lumpkin, in Mell v. Moony, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. 413</span>, 416, resolved this question, saying: "Is the precept to the Clerk to issue an execution for the amount sworn to by the mortgagee a judgment? . . . Such has not, we believe, been the construction put upon the proceeding of foreclosure. On the contrary, our Courts have invariably held, that the mortgager might go into the consideration of the mortgage, and rely upon any fact or principle of law which would entitle him to relief . . . For in this, no previous notice is required, and, of course, the proceeding can not conclude the mortgager. Indeed, it would seem from the terms of the statute that his right to be heard does not arise until the execution issues." (Emphasis supplied.) As pointed out by Justice Lumpkin in Crawford v. Scott, <span class="casemissing">137 Ga. 760 (74 SE 520)</span> at page 765, since the defendant has no notice of the summary proceedings to foreclose the mortgage until a levy is made under the execution, to deny him the right to set up his defense after the execution would allow the plaintiff to obtain a judgment of foreclosure behind which the defendant could not go by affidavit of illegality. "Apparently," he says, "it would be an adjudication without ability to prevent it, as the only remedy would be to go into a court of equity, or a court administering equitable relief, and ask for an injunction against the proceeding at law, and there set up his defense. But this is the very thing which this court has several times declared it was not the intention of the statute to require the defendant to do." In General Gas Corp. v. Robinson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/46/index.html">101 Ga. App. 192 (112 SE2d 774)</a></span>, this court upheld the right of a defendant in fi. fa. to file an affidavit of illegality to an execution after levy had been made on the property. See also, A. D. L. Sales Co. v. Gailey, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 798 (173 SE 734)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. Having decided that the defendants could, as a matter of right, interpose the affidavits of illegality to the executions, we now reach the question of the merits of the affidavits. Under the terms of the conditional-sale contracts, the defendants were liable to the plaintiff vendor for all payments. The contract of insurance was a separate instrument entirely and was between the insurer and the defendants. For this reason, the agreement in the insurance contract to pay the creditor any amounts payable under the disability provisions thereof was, under the circumstances, enforceable by the defendants only, not by the plaintiff, a stranger to the contract of insurance. This clause, then, is not a defense to the plaintiff's foreclosure proceedings, but merely gives the defendants a cause of action against the insurer for not having made the installment payments to the plaintiff as agreed.</div><div class="casepar">It follows from the above that the court erred in overruling the plaintiff's demurrers to the affidavits of illegality.</div><div class="casepar">Judgments reversed.
