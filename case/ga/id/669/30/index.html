Polk City Court. Before Judge Flournoy.</div><div class="casepresiding">JORDAN, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Where a policy of life insurance provided. "This policy shall take effect on its date of issue, provided the insured is then alive and in sound health, but not otherwise," and the uncontradicted evidence showed that the insured was not in sound health at the time the policy was issued for the reason that she had been operated upon and found to have cancer of the liver and pancreas in an advanced stage after the submission of the application for insurance and before the policy was issued, and there was no evidence of waiver of this provision of the policy by an officer of the insurance company having authority to make such waiver, a finding was demanded for the insurance company; and the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">This was a suit on a life insurance policy, issued to Mrs. Eula M. Hopkins, brought by M. T. Hopkins, the beneficiary, against the Liberty National Life Insurance Company to recover the face value of the policy, $500, plus the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees for bad faith. The case was tried in the City Court of Polk County before a jury, and a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $825. The defendant filed a motion for new trial on the general grounds only and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the exception is to the denial of said motions.</div><div class="casepar">The undisputed evidence in this case discloses that the application for insurance was made on July 4, 1960 (although the application was dated July 7, 1960) and that the policy was issued on July 18, 1960. The application was not attached to and made a part of the policy. It is also undisputed that the applicant was apparently in sound health when the application was made on July 4, 1960, but that she was subsequently hospitalized on July 7, 1960, and was operated upon on July 13, 1960, at which time it was discovered that she had cancer of the liver and pancreas in an advanced stage. The applicant died on October 5, 1960. This evidence demanded a finding that the applicant was not in sound health on the date that the policy was issued by the defendant insurance company.</div><div class="casepar">It is insisted therefore by the defendant company that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict since the contract of insurance sued upon in this case expressly provided that: "This policy shall take effect on its date of issue, provided the insured is then alive and in sound health, but not otherwise."</div><div class="casepar">That the parties to an insurance contract can make the issuance of the policy while the insured is in sound health a valid and binding condition precedent to the liability of the company is without question. Glover v. New York Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 615 (109 SE 546)</span>. Such requirement in a policy of insurance, however, that the insured be in sound health on the date of issuance of the policy, refers to a change in health between the time of taking the application for the insurance and the date of issuance and delivery of the policy; and where the condition of health of the insured on the date of issuance of the policy is the same as on the date of application, such provision will not void the policy. Interstate Life &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. McMahon, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 543 (2) (179 SE 132)</span>; Fowler v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 765 (38 SE2d 60)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">It is thus contended by the plaintiff beneficiary that a verdict for the insurance company was not demanded because of the above stipulation in the policy of insurance since the jury was authorized to find that the applicant's cancer existed at the time the application for insurance was made although its existence was unknown to her at that time; and under such circumstances a finding was not demanded that there had been a change in the insured's health between the date of the application and the date of the issuance of the policy.</div><div class="casepar">This contention is without merit. The term "sound health," as used in a life insurance policy means that the insured enjoys such health and strength as to justify the reasonable belief that he is free from derangement of organic functions, or free from symptoms calculated to cause reasonable apprehension of such derangement, and to ordinary observation and to outward appearance his health is reasonably such that he may with ordinary safety be insured upon ordinary terms, and that he apparently has no grave impairment or serious disease or other ailment that seriously affects the general soundness and healthfulness of the system. Life &amp;c. Ins. Co. of Tenn. v. Higdon, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 679 (21 SE2d 270)</span>, and citations.</div><div class="casepar">Likewise, the term, "change in health," as applied in the present case has been held to mean an apparent or manifested change in condition of health of the insured between the date of application and the date of issuance and delivery of the policy. Pierce v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 337</span>, 342 (<span class="casemissing">178 SE 189</span>). The policy under consideration in the Pierce case provided that, "no obligation is assumed by the company prior to the date and delivery of this policy, nor unless on said date the insured is alive and in sound health;" and in that case the evidence disclosed that the applicant for insurance was seemingly and to outward appearance in good health when the application for insurance was made, but that as a matter of fact the applicant, unknown to himself, was in the last stages of a fatal disease and that such disease manifested itself and was discovered by his doctor subsequently to the date of application but prior to the date of delivery of the policy. Accordingly, it was held therein that the court did not err in directing a verdict for the defendant insurance company since the contract of insurance had not been consummated for the reason that the applicant was not in sound health on the date of the delivery of the policy as required by the above provision of the policy.</div><div class="casepar">The case of National Life &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">35 Ga. App. 1 (2) (132 SE 120)</span>, relied upon by the plaintiff beneficiary, is not applicable here. In that case it was held that where the insured was apparently in sound health on the date the policy was issued, the policy could not thereafter be avoided by the insurance company by reason of the fact that the insured had been afflicted with an incipient, unknown, and fatal malady at the time the policy was issued which had not at that time manifested itself or in any way deranged, impaired, or affected the general soundness and healthfulness of the insured's system.</div><div class="casepar">In the present case the applicant's unsound condition of health manifested itself before the policy was issued but subsequently to the application, and this case is therefore controlled by the Pierce case, supra. Accordingly, since the evidence demanded a finding that the applicant was not in sound health on the date of issuance of the policy, and the same being a condition precedent to the liability of the defendant insurance company (no question of waiver of said condition being involved in this case), the trial court erred in refusing to grant the defendant company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict made in accordance with its previous motion for a directed verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed with direction that the trial court enter judgment for the defendant in accordance with its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
