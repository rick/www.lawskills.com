Under powers conferred by charter on a municipality to regulate traffic, parking of vehicles on its streets, to control its streets, and to pass ordinances, the governing authorities may provide for the period or time of parking to be registered by mechanical parking meters, and charge such sum therefor as is reasonably necessary to defray the expenses incident thereto; and the lack of profit from the operation of the parking meters is not a valid reason for their removal, on a petition brought for that purpose by citizens and taxpayers.</div><div class="casepar">2. The allegations of the petition as amended are not sufficient to raise any question of abuse of discretion by the governing authorities of the city as to the installation and operation of parking meters.</div><div class="casepar">3. It appearing from the only ordinance attached to the petition by a copy thereof that it applies to all persons alike, and there being no allegations in connection with its administration that the exceptions alleged to favor others against the petitioners were unnecessary or arbitrary in comparable circumstances, neither the ordinance as to parking meters nor its administration as alleged is violative of article 1, section 1. paragraph 3 of the Constitution of Georgia, providing that there shall be no deprivation of property without due process of law, nor of article 1, section 1, paragraph 2 of said Constitution, providing that protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete.</div><div class="casepar">4. No question is properly raised as to the validity of a contract between a city and a parking-meter company merely by a prayer for the contract to be declared void, where it is not set out or attached by a copy thereof nor its terms and conditions stated in the petition.</div><div class="casepar">5. It was not erroneous to sustain the general demurrers and dismiss the petition. </div><div class="casepar">On September 26, 1949, Seaborn Ashley and Ashley Mercantile Company brought their equitable petition against the City of Greensboro, its named mayor and aldermen, and Dual Parking Meter Company, seeking an injunction prohibiting the further operation of parking meters on streets in said city; praying also for certain ordinances in reference thereto to be declared unconstitutional as discriminatory, and that contracts of the defendants with reference to said parking system be declared void. The petition was twice amended, subject to demurrers. The allegations of the amended petition were substantially as set out hereinafter. The petitioners are residents and taxpayers of said city. They operate a mercantile business on Main Street, and said Ashley is a large stockholder in a real estate and insurance company known as Greensboro Land and Development Company on Main Street in said city, all within said parking-meter zone. Said parking meters were installed under an ordinance of said city passed July 5, 1949, to be effective August 1, 1949, an attached copy of which stated that it was adopted, "because of the width of the streets in certain sections of the City of Greensboro, Ga., the free moving traffic in the downtown business district is impeded; and whereas, previous attempts to regulate the parking in the aforesaid areas have not been as successful as is desirable because of the small number of traffic policemen available therefor, and the size of the area; and whereas, because of the habit of numerous operators of motor vehicles by which they take advantage of the above-mentioned situation by parking for unreasonably long periods of time in proximity to other motor vehicles so parked on the most congested parts of the city's busiest streets tend to further impede traffic, is unfair to other motorists, and constitutes a danger to the life and property of motorists and pedestrians; and whereas, it is the opinion of this Council that the best way by which the above-mentioned conditions can be remedied is by the designation of individual parking spaces in said area, by providing for the use of mechanical parking-time indicators in conjunction therewith, by restricting parking in said area to reasonable intervals of time, and by compelling the operators of vehicles who enjoy the use of parking space so designated, pay a portion of the cost of establishing and maintaining the same." Under the ordinance, certain streets, including portions of Main Street, were declared to be a "congested area," and the police were directed to designate individual spaces within the declared congested traffic areas for the parking of vehicles. Provision was made for coins to be deposited for a specified length of parking time, giving motorists the benefit of parking within the metered time. Penalties were provided for violation. The Dual Parking Meter Company was authorized to install meters at indicated places. The amended petition alleged that it was impossible to ascertain or allege what would be the effect of the ordinance, and how it would be enforced, until after a fair trial. Under the contract with the parking-meter company a payment in excess of $11,000 for said meters is required before title there to will vest in said city, and at the prevailing rate of revenue it will take at least six years to "pay the debt." The total receipts from the parking meters aggregated $233.31 during August, 1949, and $317.68 during September, 1949. Under the contract one-half of the proceeds from the deposits in the meters would go to the parking-meter company to be applied on the purchase-price of the parking meters, and the remaining one-half would go to said city, the latter, according to the petitioners' allegation, "as revenue</div><div class="casepar">and for the payment of the special policeman." The salary of said policeman is $200 per month, and the city's half of the intake of the parking meters has been insufficient to meet and pay said salary. The meters are therefore operated at a loss and, according to the petitioners' allegation, "can neither be justified as a revenue measure nor a police measure." In such operation the defendants are guilty of such an abuse of discretion as deprives the petitioners of their constitutional rights. The ordinance is unreasonable, in that there is a systematic discrimination against the petitioners because certain property owners within the zone have free parking space, while the petitioners' customers are required to pay a parking fee before they can do business with the petitioners, resulting in a financial loss to them, inconvenience and annoyance to the petitioners' clerks, customers, and others in the petitioners' places of business. The parking meters within some of the area were moved by the defendant, giving special privileges and advantages to others and property of others, not accorded to the petitioners, all of which is contended as being violative of article 1, section 1, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of Georgia, providing that there shall be no deprivation of property without due process of law, and also violative of article 1, section 1, paragraph 2 of said Constitution, providing that protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete. It was alleged that certain protests had been made to the city authorities against the adoption of the parking-meter ordinance, and copies of the protest were attached as exhibits.</div><div class="casepar">Separate general and special demurrers to the petition were filed by the defendants, and were renewed after both amendments to the petition. The first two grounds of demurrer were as follows: (1) that no cause of action was set out; and (2) that the allegations did not entitle the plaintiffs to the relief sought. Upon hearing said demurrers, the trial judge sustained grounds 1 and 2 of said general demurrer and dismissed the petition. To that judgment the plaintiffs excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. The charter of the City of Greensboro confers upon its governing authorities power to regulate traffic and the parking of vehicles on its streets, to control its streets, to appoint special policemen whenever necessary, to pass ordinances or regulations for the peace, security, health, happiness, welfare, or convenience of the inhabitants, and for the preserving of good order of said city. Ga. L. 1939, pp. 1070-1122, secs. 103, 87, 85, 28, 3. Under those charter powers, the city may provide by ordinance for the period of time of parking to be registered by mechanical parking meters and charge such sum there for as is reasonably necessary to defray the expenses incident thereto. Gardner v. Brunswick, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 167</span>, 172 (28 S. E. 2d, 135). The use of streets for the purpose of parking automobiles is a privilege and not a right, and the privilege of parking must be accepted with such reasonable burdens as the city may impose as a condition for the enjoyment of that privilege. Gardner v. City of Brunswick, supra. See also Owens v. Owens, 193 S. C. 260 (8 S. E. 2d, 339); Bowers v. City of Muskegan, 305 Mich. 676 (9 N. W. 2d, 889). To establish that a parking meter ordinance is a "revenue measure" and hence invalid, it must appear that the scheme of the ordinance is such that receipts will continuously and by a substantial amount exceed the cost of installation, maintenance, and regulation. Wilhoit v. Springfield, 237 Mo. App. 775 (171 S. W. 2d, 95); Andrews v. City of Marion, 221 Ind. 422 (47 N. E. 2d, 968); In re Opinion of Justices, 297 Mass. 559 (8 N. E. 2d, 179); Ex parte Duncan, 179 Okla. 355 (65 Pac. 2d, 1015); Laubach &amp; Sons v. Easton, 347 Pa. 542 (32 Atl. 2d, 881).</div><div class="casepar">Cf. County Court of Webster County v. Roman, 121 W. Va. 381 (3 S. E. 2d, 631); Owens v. Owens, supra; Ex parte Harrison, 135 Tex. Crim. R. 611 (122 5 W. 2d, 314); Harper v. City of Wichita Falls (Tex. Civ. App.), 105 S. W. 2d, 743; District of Columbia v. Smith, 93 Fed. 2d, 650 (3).</div><div class="casepar">2. The allegation that parking meters can not be justified as a police measure must be construed together with the attached ordinance and the recitals therein made concerning the congestion of traffic, the unsuccessful previous attempts to regulate parking in the areas, and the small number of policemen available for the direction of traffic. It is a well-recognized rule that, when the authorities of a municipality are authorized to do a thing at their discretion, the courts will not interfere to control that discretion, and inquire into the propriety, economy, and general wisdom of the undertaking, or into the details of the manner adopted to carry the project into execution. Danielly v. Cabaniss, <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. 211 (4)</span>; Wilson v. Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. 560</span>, 564 (139 S. E. 148); City of Atlanta v. Stein, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 789</span>, 791 (36 S. E. 932, 933). In the last-cited case it was said: "Certainly, they [the courts] should never undertake to substitute their judgment, in matters of judgment, for that of the city's governing authorities." See also Chipstead v. Oliver, <span class="casemissing">137 Ga. 483 (2)</span> (73 S. E. 576); Schofield v. Bishop, <span class="casemissing">192 Ga. 732</span>, 738, 740 (16 S. E. 2d, 714). Such action will not be interfered with unless it is arbitrary and amounts to an abuse of discretion. City of Gainesville v. Dunlap, <span class="casemissing">147 Ga. 344</span> (94 S. E. 247); Dyer v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">132 Ga. 445</span> (64 S. E. 475). Measured by the foregoing, the allegations do not raise any question of abuse of discretion.</div><div class="casepar">3. It is alleged that the ordinance is unreasonable, both in its operation and by virtue of the fact that it is contrary to article 1, section 1, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of Georgia, providing that there shall be no deprivation of property without due process of law, and also violative of article 1, section 1, paragraph 2 of said Constitution, providing that protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete. The basis of the asserted invalidity is that there is a systematic discrimination against property owners doing business within the parking-meter zone of said city, and certain owners of property are granted free parking spaces for the transaction of business, while the petitioners, who are competitors of some of them, have no free parking place; and all of the petitioners' customers are required to pay a parking fee before they can do business with the petitioners, and this results to them in financial loss and inconvenience, and annoyance of their clerks, customers, and others in the petitioners' places of business. It is also alleged that the defendants have further discriminated against the petitioners, in that they have passed a resolution or ordinance or have otherwise authorized jurors, witnesses, court officials, and school-bus drivers to park their cars around the courthouse square within the parking-meter area.</div><div class="casepar">The copy of the only ordinance attached to the petition or set out there in does not contain exceptions in favor of the individuals or groups alleged in the petition as being preferred, but shows on its face that it is applicable to all persons alike. In Gardner v. Brunswick, supra, the court stated: " 'It is only in cases where laws are applied differently to different persons under the same or similar circumstances that the equal protection of the law is denied.' Baugh v. LaGrange, <span class="casemissing">161 Ga. 80</span> (2a) (130 S. E. 69). See also Toney v. Macon, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 83</span>, 87 (46 S. E. 80); City of Valdosta v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 490 (4)</span> (119 S. E. 625); Georgia Southern &amp; Florida Ry. Co. v. Adkins, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 826</span> (120 S. E. 610). In the case of Borough of Atlanta v. Kirk, supra [<span class="casemissing">175 Ga. 399</span>, 165 S. E. 72], Mr. Presiding Justice Beck said: 'The power of courts to declare an ordinance void because it is unreasonable is one which must be carefully exercised. When the ordinance is within the grant of power conferred upon the municipality, the presumption is that it is reasonable, unless its unreasonable character appears upon its face.' He then quotes wish approval from 2 Dill. Mun. Cor. 928,  591, as follows: 'If the ordinance is not inherently unfair, unreasonable, or oppressive, the person attacking it must assume the burden of affirmatively showing that as applied to him it is unreasonable, unfair, and oppressive.' "</div><div class="casepar">If an ordinance be attacked on the ground that it is unreasonable because of extrinsic facts, the facts should be alleged ( Atlantic Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Savannah, <span class="casemissing">136 Ga. 657</span>, 71 S. E. 1115), and the courts will construe a city ordinance so as to make it reasonable when this can be done. City Council of Augusta v. Loftis, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 77</span>, 84 (118 S. E. 666, 670). The reasonableness or unreasonableness of a city ordinance is a question of law for the court to decide, and not for the jury, unless it depends in the opinion of the court on the existence of particular facts which are disputed. Metropolitan Street Railroad Co. v. Johnson, <span class="casemissing">90 Ga. 500 (7)</span> (16 S. E. 49); Schofield v. Bishop, supra. As above pointed out, the only ordinance which is with the petition shows on its face that it applies to all persons alike. If there is some other ordinance containing a preferential treatment, it is not set out or attached. The only ordinance that is under attack is the one which the pleadings set out by a copy thereof. That ordinance is neither unreasonable nor violative of either of the two constitutional provisions asserted.</div><div class="casepar">It is true that the courts will enjoin the unreasonable and arbitrary administration of a reasonable ordinance ( City Council of Augusta v. Loftis, supra), and ordinances may be unreasonably administered to the injury of another, in which case its administration becomes void. Loeb v. Jennings, <span class="casemissing">133 Ga. 796</span>, (67 S. E. 101); City Council of Augusta v. Loftis, supra; 37 Am. Jur. 782,  161; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (6 Sup. Ct. 1064, 30 L. ed. 220 (6)). In the petition under consideration, it is not alleged that, in the instances where free parking time is allowed persons or places of business, similar circumstances prevail as to those who claim they are denied those privileges, as, for instance, that ingress and egress facilities are equal, or that such exceptions are unnecessary or arbitrary on comparable conditions. When considered with the above principles in mind, the amended petition does not make allegations sufficient to constitute an issue of unreasonable and arbitrary administration of a reasonable ordinance.</div><div class="casepar">4. Vague references are made in the amended petition to a contract between the City of Greensboro and the Dual Parking Meter Company, and a prayer seeks to have it declared void. However, no copy of the contract is set out in or attached to the petition, and the meager references to it in the pleading are not sufficient to raise any question as to its validity.</div><div class="casepar">5. There was no error in the judgment of the court below, sustaining the general demurrers and dismissing the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
