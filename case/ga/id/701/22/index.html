November 15, 1954.</div><div class="casepresiding">QUILLIAN, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Ruby Mae Grooms filed a claim for compensation with the State Board of Workmen's Compensation alleging that she was the widow of Coperlester Grooms and that her husband had sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment by Gordon Foods, Inc., which resulted in his death. She named Globe Indemnity Company, the employer's insurance carrier, a party defendant.</div><div class="casepar">Nellie Grooms, alleging herself to be a sister of Coperlester Grooms and his dependent within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Law, filed her intervention, in which she denied that Ruby Mae Grooms was the lawful widow of her deceased brother.</div><div class="casepar">It was admitted by the employer and by the insurer that the death of Grooms was caused by an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. They protested, as did Nellie Grooms, that the claimant was not the deceased's widow. The controversy centered around the alleged common-law marriage of the claimant to Coperlester Grooms.</div><div class="casepar">The record shows that, on June 29, 1953, a Deputy Director of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation entered an award in favor of the claimant, Ruby Grooms, requiring the employer, Gordon Foods, Inc., and its insurance carrier, Globe Indemnity Company, to pay her compensation. The award also denied compensation to the intervening claimant, Nellie Grooms.</div><div class="casepar">Upon the full board entering the above-quoted award, the claimant Ruby Grooms appealed to the Superior Court of Fulton County.</div><div class="casepar">On January 14, 1954, Hon. Ralph H. Pharr rendered a judgment reversing the award of the full board. The judgment reads: "The appeal of Ruby Mae Grooms coming on to be heard, after argument thereon, it is considered, ordered and adjudged that the portion of the award of the full board of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation which reads, 'it is ordered that this case be assigned for de novo hearing before a single director, or a deputy, in Atlanta, Georgia.' is reversed upon the ground that the full board acted in excess of their powers in respect thereto and the case is remanded to the full board for further action in accordance with the law."</div><div class="casepar">On May 6, 1954, the full board, without hearing additional evidence, entered an award affirming the original award of the deputy director.</div><div class="casepar">The employer, the insurance carrier, and Nellie Grooms appealed to the superior court. Honorable Ralph H. Pharr, Judge of Fulton Superior Court, on November 15, 1954, entered an order vacating the award of the full board, ordering a de novo hearing before the full board, and that additional evidence be taken either by the board, or by a single director of the board who, upon taking the evidence, should deliver it to all of the directors for consideration.</div><div class="casepar">The judgment contained an opinion of the trial judge containing his previous judgment of January 14, 1954, hereinbefore quoted. The opinion read: "When the first appeal was before me, the award and decision of the full board was that the award of the deputy director, 'be and it is hereby revoked and set aside in its entirety and it is ordered that this case be assigned for a de novo hearing before a single director, . . .' My order did not affect that portion of the original full board decision which I have underscored above. My order held only that the portion of the decision making an assignment to a single director for a de novo hearing was erroneous. It, therefore, became the law of the case that the award of the deputy director was set aside and revoked. Therefore, it is the opinion of the court that the State Board of Workmen's Compensation was required by this court's judgment of January 14, 1954, to either grant a de novo hearing before all of the directors, or remand the case, for the purpose of taking additional evidence, to a single director, who, upon taking such evidence, would be required to deliver it to all of the directors for consideration by them in rendering any further decision or award in this case. Accordingly, it is ordered that the full board award dated May 6, 1954, is hereby reversed and set aside and the case is remanded to the State Board of Workmen's Compensation."</div><div class="casepar">Upon the judgment of November 15, 1954, being entered the claimant Ruby Mae Grooms excepted and brought the case here for review.</div><div class="casepar">We have written the history of the case in order that our opinion may be clearly understood. It is likewise necessary to relate a portion of the evidence for the same purpose.</div><div class="casepar">The claimant Ruby Mae Grooms testified that she celebrated a ceremonial marriage with Roy Atkinson in 1928 and continued to live with him in the bonds of matrimony until January, 1945, at which time he deserted her and she never saw him or heard of him. She admitted frankly that she had made no inquiry concerning him, and that she knew members of his family and where he was employed at the time of their separation. However, she professed not to know the location of the domiciles of his kin folk, and stoutly maintained that she was uninformed as to whether he continued to live in Atlanta after their separation. She related that she afterwards entered into a common-law marriage with Coperlester Grooms in January, 1950, and at the time she assumed Roy Atkinson was dead. She testified that she lived with Grooms until his death, in good faith believing her former spouse had departed this life. She produced some evidence in the nature of her own testimony, supporting witnesses and corroborating circumstances tending to show a valid common-law marriage to the deceased Grooms and subsequent cohabitation with him in good faith from January, 1950, until the time of his death, February 11, 1953. While she professed entire ignorance in reference to Atkinson's longevity, she produced no evidence of his death, except the fact that she had not seen or heard of him since 1945. However, on cross-examination she testified that there was an impediment that prevented her from entering into a ceremonial marriage with Coperlester Grooms, that impediment being that she had a living husband. The record discloses the following answers made by her to questions propounded on cross-examination: "Q. But you lived with him up until the time he was killed and still had not made up your mind to go down and get married? A. We had made up our minds. Q. Isn't it true that the reason you didn't go was because you had a living husband and you were not legally qualified to marry him? A. Yes sir, that is true. Q. That is the very truth, isn't it? A. Yes, sir."</div><div class="casepar"> The appeal of the employer and the insurance carrier to the superior court was on the usual grounds that there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to support the award of the full board, that the board acted in excess of its powers in making the award, and that the award was contrary to law. The appeal contained an additional ground which, succinctly stated, complained that the board abused its discretion and did not follow the directions of the superior court in not allowing the appellants to introduce newly discovered evidence. The appeal of Nellie Grooms was on the same grounds.</div><div class="casepar">The judge of the superior court should have affirmed the award of the compensation board unless it ought to have been reversed on one of the grounds contained in the appeals.</div><div class="casepar">The learned judge in the judgment now under review recites that the case was formerly before him on appeal; that in a former judgment rendered by him on January 14, 1954, and fully set out in the foregoing statement of fact, he ordered the compensation board to admit additional evidence in the case; and that the former judgment became the law of the case. Predicating his judgment upon that construction of the judgment previously entered by him, the judge reversed the award of the compensation board and ordered that, "Accordingly, it is ordered that the full board award dated May 6, 1954, is hereby reversed and set aside and the case is remanded to the State Board of Workmen's Compensation. Upon remand of the case the State Board of Workmen's Compensation shall either grant a de novo hearing before all of the directors, or remand the case, for the purpose of taking additional evidence, to a single director, who, upon taking such evidence, shall deliver it to all of the directors for consideration by them in rendering further decisions or award in this case."</div><div class="casepar">A careful analysis of the previous judgment of January 14, 1954, discloses that it set aside a former award of the compensation board on the ground that the board was without authority to remand to a deputy director for the purpose of a de novo hearing. The judgment did not direct or instruct the board to take any action except to take further action in accordance with law. It is apparent that the judgment was not correctly predicated upon the ground that the previous judgment adjudicated the question as to whether newly discovered evidence should be admitted by the board.</div><div class="casepar">We are aware of the rule stated in Megarity v. Gann, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 264</span>, 266 (19 S. E. 2d 924): "There are a number of decisions to the effect that if an order is capable of two constructions the one placed on it by the trial court will be adopted by the appellate court as the proper construction." But in our opinion the judgment dated January 14, 1954, was not susceptible to the interpretation given it by its author, and cannot be so construed by us.</div><div class="casepar">The question as to whether the board abused its discretion in not receiving the newly discovered evidence is not before us for decision, since the question was not passed upon by the judge of the superior court.</div><div class="casepar">The question that we think is controlling in this case is whether the award of the full board, affirming that of the deputy director, was authorized by the evidence already in the record. We recognize the principle that, where a person who has previously been married enters into a second marriage, the law presumes that the first marriage was dissolved by divorce or death of the other spouse.</div><div class="casepar">In the case of Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. App. 889</span>, 891 (2) (24 S. E. 2d 803), this court held: "The controlling question here is, who carried the burden of proof as to the competitive marriages? It is well settled by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court and this court that where a second marriage is established, and it is shown that one so married had previously married another person, whose whereabouts at the time of the second marriage and thereafter were unknown, the presumption is that the first marriage had been dissolved by a divorce decree, or that the first husband or wife was dead; and that the burden is upon the party attacking the validity of the second marriage to show that a divorce had not been granted and that the first husband or wife was not dead."</div><div class="casepar">While the case of Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Reed, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../719/60/index.html">84 Ga. App. 541</a></span> (66 S. E. 2d 360), appears to conflict somewhat with the Bituminous Casualty Corp. case, and though it seems that the question as to whether the presumption that the previous marriage was dissolved by divorce or death prior to the second marriage of one of the parties, applies to common-law marriages, may not be entirely free from doubt, it is certain that a woman who recognizes that she is not qualified to contract a ceremonial marriage because she has, according to her own testimony a living husband, is by reason of the same impediment ineligible to enter into a common-law marriage.</div><div class="casepar">The conduct of Ruby Mae Grooms in not inquiring from sources convenient to her and from which she could have obtained complete information as to whether her husband was still in life amounted in our opinion to avoiding knowledge of whether she had a living husband when she allegedly married Coperlester Grooms. We think her behavior in this regard at least made a question of fact for the determination of the board as to whether she married Grooms in good faith.</div><div class="casepar">But whether the full board had sufficient evidence presented to it by Ruby Mae Grooms' testimony on direct examination and the testimony of her witness to have entitled her to compensation, by reason of the presumption that her former spouse was dead, her testimony on cross-examination that she had a living husband, and for that reason could not contract a ceremonial marriage, conclusively established that she was not the widow of Coperlester Grooms and consequently was not entitled to an award of compensation.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence demanded an award in favor of the intervening claimant, Nellie Grooms. A further hearing before the Board of Workmen's Compensation is unnecessary.</div><div class="casepar">The judgment of the superior court reversing the award of the full board, which approved the award of the deputy director that the claimant, Ruby Grooms, be paid compensation, is affirmed with the direction that the superior court so modify its judgment that, in lieu of directing that additional evidence be heard, it direct that the State Board of Workmen's Compensation enter an award in accordance with this opinion, that is, an award denying compensation to the claimant Ruby Mae Grooms, and in favor of the claimant Nellie Grooms, in such amount as the State Board of Workmen's Compensation may determine she is entitled to, under Code  114-413 (c), according to the evidence contained in the record in this case.</div><div class="casepar">FELTON, C. J., dissenting. The full board's order of July 31, 1953, set aside the award of the deputy director dated June 29, 1953, and remanded the case to the deputy director for a de novo hearing, and this full board's order, as modified by the judgment of the superior court dated January 14, 1954, became the law of the case, to the effect that the case was remanded to the full board for a de novo hearing, which necessarily would permit the introduction of additional evidence by any party to the record. Since the board refused to hear new evidence, its action was contrary to the law of the case, as the unreversed portion of the full board's order, to wit, that there should be a de novo hearing, remained the law of the case. I do not think that the judgment of the superior court intended to reverse the order of the board requiring a de novo hearing. If the superior court's order is susceptible of two or more constructions, I certainly do not think the construction put on it by the superior court itself is so unreasonable that it can be repudiated by this court. Megarity v. Gann, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 264</span>. Whether or not the award appealed from is contrary to law, there is another claimant involved whose rights have not been ruled on directly, and, assuming that she is entitled to an award, whose degree of dependency has not been determined.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Ferdinand Buckley, Marshall, Greene &amp; Neely, Francis Y.
