Before Judge Holton.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The case of the appellant, Ehrlich Anthony Coker, is before this court by direct appeal and for mandatory review of the death sentence received at trial. The crimes which appellant was charged with committing occurred on September 2, 1974; indictments were returned against him on October 18, 1974; and, a trial on appellant's special plea of insanity was held on November 19, 1974. The appellant was found competent to stand trial and his trial on the general issue got under way on November 20, 1974, resulting in sentences imposed December 4, 1974. A majority of the court find no reversible error and affirm the convictions and sentences. We agree with the trial judge that "[d]efendant was fully represented by capable and effective [counsel] . . . and received a fair trial . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The appellant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment; he was convicted of rape and sentenced to death; he was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to 20 years; he was convicted of motor vehicle theft and sentenced to seven years; and, he was convicted of escape and sentenced to five years.</div><div class="casepar">I.</div><div class="casepar">Summary of the Evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The prosecution presented evidence which established the following: On the evening of September 2, 1974, around 7:30 p.m., several inmates attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous in the chapel of the Ware County Correctional Institution. Around 8:10 p.m., an inmate, brandishing a five or six-pound steel bar, announced, "Be still . . . this is an escape." The supervisor of the meeting Corrections Counselor George Silver, requested that the inmates who were not involved be allowed to get behind the counselor. Several inmates complied with the counselor's request.</div><div class="casepar">At this point, three inmates, including the appellant, began tearing through a plywood ceiling with the steel bar. A few minutes later, Warden Bruce Brown discovered that the inmates had torn through the roof of the chapel, gone across the building to an area not enclosed by the prison fence, and jumped off another building into the woods adjoining the prison grounds.</div><div class="casepar">Later the same evening, around 11:00 p.m., a man dressed in prison clothes suddenly came through the back door of the home of 16-year-old Allen David Carver. Carver was in the kitchen with his wife while his three-week-old son was in a bedroom asleep. The intruder swung a board toward and close to Allen Carver.</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Carver identified the appellant as the man who broke into his home. Appellant ordered Carver's wife to tie up her husband and she tied his hands and feet. The appellant then tied Carver to the bathroom shower rod with Carver's belt. Appellant confiscated Carver's wallet, clothes, money totaling $20.30 and keys. Subsequently, appellant gagged Carver with his wife's underpants. when appellant was not using the board to intimidate the young couple, he used a four-inch steak knife which he took from Mrs. Carver.</div><div class="casepar">After appellant had bound and gagged Allen Carver in the bathroom, the appellant raped Mrs. Carver. At the time, Mrs. Carver was physically weak, having recently left the hospital following childbirth, and appellant was told this information. After appellant completed the rape he inquired and was told how to crank the Carvers' car.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant then forced Mrs. Carver to accompany him in the car and made her sit directly next to him while effecting an escape from the locale. Before appellant left with Mrs. Carver, he told her husband, whom he left bound and gagged, ". . . I'm taking her with me. If you get loose and call the police, your wife is going to be dead." Appellant was apprehended in the Carver car by police officers several hours later and Mrs. Carver was released. Appellant was still carrying the knife which he took and used in the commission of the crimes.</div><div class="casepar">II.</div><div class="casepar">Enumerations of Error.</div><div class="casepar">In his attack on the conviction and sentence in case No. 29758, appellant asserts 79 enumerations of error. These enumerations will be grouped, where appropriate, as applicable legal principles are common to more than one enumeration.</div><div class="casepar">1. In Enumerations 1, 3 and 4, appellant alleges improper joinder for trial of the charges of escape and motor vehicle theft with the other charges contained in the indictment.</div><div class="casepar">The recent case of Jarrell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../54/index.html">234 Ga. 410</a></span> addressed this issue. In a case where "[f]rom the nature of the entire transaction it would be almost impossible to present to a jury evidence of one of the crimes without also permitting evidence of the other crimes to be introduced since they were all part of one continuous transaction covering a period of [several] hours," ( Henderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/65/index.html">227 Ga. 68</a></span>, 76 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/65/index.html">179 SE2d 76</a></span>); Owens v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../120/41/index.html">233 Ga. 905</a></span>) and "Two or more offenses . . . are based on the same conduct or on a series of acts connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan" ( Dingler v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/07/index.html">233 Ga. 462</a></span>, 463 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/07/index.html">211 SE2d 752</a></span>)), the joinder of the several crimes is not error. Code Ann.  26-506.</div><div class="casepar">In the present case, the motor vehicle was taken to perfect the appellant's escape and was used as an instrument of the kidnapping while fleeing from the scene of the rape and robbery. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the severance "in the interest of justice." We find no error here.</div><div class="casepar">2. In Enumeration 2, appellant alleges the trial court erred in overruling appellant's written motion to quash the indictment.</div><div class="casepar">In his motion, appellant made a general attack on the constitutionality of the Georgia Death Penalty Statute, Ga. L. 1973, pp. 159, 163 (Code Ann.  27-2534.1). This statute has been repeatedly upheld by a majority of this court. See Coley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/11/index.html">231 Ga. 829</a></span>, 833 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/11/index.html">204 SE2d 612</a></span>); Eberheart v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../121/59/index.html">232 Ga. 247 (206 SE2d 12)</a></span>; Hooks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../117/69/index.html">233 Ga. 149 (210 SE2d 668)</a></span>; Mitchell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../114/79/index.html">234 Ga. 160</a></span>. We affirm those rulings here.</div><div class="casepar">Additionally, appellant attacks the armed robbery statute, Code Ann.  26-1902, the rape statute, Code Ann.  26-2001 and the kidnapping statute, Code Ann.  26-1311, as being unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, discretionary and overbroad so as to violate due process and equal protection clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitutions.</div><div class="casepar">Neither at trial nor before this court has appellant supported these contentions with persuasive argument or authority. We have read the statutes and believe they properly apprise a defendant of the charge he must defend against and are sufficient to protect him from double jeopardy. We affirm the trial court's ruling.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant objected to Count 5 (escape) because it stated and described each and every charge of which the defendant stood convicted. This objection was recognized by the trial court in that a stipulation subsequently was entered into which stated only that the defendant "has prior to this time and prior to the date on which he was charged with escape, been convicted of a prior felony, and was at the time of the alleged escape in lawful confinement in the Ware Correctional Institution."</div><div class="casepar">There is no merit to this enumeration even if we assume the initial objection had merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. In Enumeration 3, appellant alleges the trial court erred in refusing to admit into evidence at the special plea of insanity trial the summary of a doctor's report of examination of the appellant.</div><div class="casepar">There is only a bare allegation in appellant's brief that it was harmful for the trial court to refuse to admit into evidence the summary of Dr. Johnson, the appellant's psychiatrist, containing his report of examination and recommendations of the condition of the appellant at the time of the commission of the alleged criminal acts and at the time of trial.</div><div class="casepar">All of the doctor's findings could be elicited on direct examination. The doctor was a witness at the trial. To admit his report in evidence would bolster his testimony by providing a written memorandum of his testimony for the jury not permitted in the case of other witnesses. Additionally, admission of the summary into evidence would have been cumulative and repetitive of the witness' testimony which appears to have been full and exhaustive concerning his findings as a result of the examination he made of appellant. In the absence of any showing of injury this bare claim of error presents nothing for review. Brown v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">66 Ga. 71</span>; Robinson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/40/index.html">229 Ga. 14</a></span>, 16 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/40/index.html">189 SE2d 53</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">4. In Enumerations 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 21 and 41, appellant alleges error in the admission of specific opinion evidence which he characterizes as "conclusory statements" or incompetent evidence. Some of the statements occurred during the special plea of insanity trial and others occurred during the trial of the general issue. The statements in dispute are as follows:</div><div class="casepar">a (6). Allowing the defense psychiatrist to discuss the "M'Naughton case" is alleged as error in that it affected the credibility of the witness because of the poor quality of his response.</div><div class="casepar">The transcript shows defense counsel initiated the discussion of appellant's ability to distinguish right and wrong on direct examination in the special plea trial although this was not an issue in that trial. See Brown v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/72/index.html">215 Ga. 784 (1) (113 SE2d 618)</a></span> for an expression of the test of competency to stand trial. As we read the testimony, the cross examination concerning the McNaughton test was a proper effort by the district attorney to demonstrate the irrelevance of the right and wrong issue in the special plea trial. No error appears.</div><div class="casepar">b (7). Although appellant's objection to the opinion testimony of a police officer, that appellant gave ordinary and reasonable answers to ordinary questions, was sustained, appellant now objects because the court failed thereafter to instruct the jury about it. Part of appellant's sustained objection was that, "He can state what the response would be and let the jury decide." The action of the trial judge in sustaining the objection indicated agreement with the position of defense counsel. In the absence of a timely request, opinion evidence does not require an instruction as to weight. Vandable v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../605/51/index.html">127 Ga. App. 306 (2) (193 SE2d 197)</a></span>. Subsequent questioning established a basis for the conclusion. If the facts are given on which opinions are based, laymen are competent to give opinions on a person's mental condition. Strickland v. State, <span class="casemissing">137 Ga. 115 (4) (72 SE 922)</span>; Proctol v. Pointer, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 134 (2) (56 SE 111)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">c (8). Appellant argues the trial court erred in overruling his objection to a "conclusory" statement of Officer Gerald Murhee, as to whether appellant knew the identity of the officer.</div><div class="casepar">Prior to the objected to statement, Officer Murhee testified that on the day prior to the day he stated appellant knew him, he (Officer Murhee) "advised Mr. Coker as to who I was, and I advised him of his rights, and I asked him some questions." Under these circumstances, the facts underlying the witness' conclusion were stated and we find no error.</div><div class="casepar">d (9). The trial court properly overruled appellant's objection to the testimony of Warden Bruce Brown of Ware Correctional Institution that the appellant was "as normal as any other inmate." The warden testified he was in daily contact with appellant from the early part of the year, that he observed him day in and day out and talked to him occasionally and couldn't tell any change in him.</div><div class="casepar">e (18). Appellant's contention that the court erred in overruling his objection and allowing the witness Shiver to testify that prisoner Brinks "was talking loud enough where all the inmates and I could hear" is without merit. Witness Shiver, a correction officer for five years was supervising an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in the chapel with about 33 persons present. His statement "all the inmates" obviously referred to all of the inmates present in the chapel, a room approximately 18 x 24 feet, and not all of the inmates in the institution.</div><div class="casepar">f (21). Appellant alleges, "The court erred in permitting the witness Shiver to testify that, '. . . there were nine inmates left at this time, and I asked them again if they were not involved to get behind me, . . .' where a Ware County Superior Court jury had immediately prior to the present case, acquitted three of these same nine defendants on charges of mutiny in a penal institution." The appellant was charged with escape -- not with mutiny -- and this testimony was admissible to show appellant had an opportunity to disassociate himself from the escape. Any action on charges of mutiny was irrelevant to any issue before the trial court in appellant's case.</div><div class="casepar">6 (41). Enumeration 41 was not argued by appellant in his appeal and is considered abandoned. Rule 18 (c) (2) Supreme Court.</div><div class="casepar">5. Enumerations 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 concern instructions given, or the denial of requested instructions, during the trial of the special plea of insanity.</div><div class="casepar">The instructions objected to were:</div><div class="casepar">"Now, I charge you that the burden rests upon the moving party, that is, Coker, the defendant, to satisfy the jury of the truth of his case by a preponderance of the evidence."</div><div class="casepar">"Now, where in the opinion of the jury the evidence is equally balanced upon each side, where the jury believe the witnesses on each side equally credible, where the jury believes the evidence is as strong on one side as the other, then a preponderance of the evidence would not be carried, and in such case it would be the duty of the jury to return a verdict in favor of the State in this case."</div><div class="casepar">"I further charge you, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever a plea of insanity is filed it shall be the duty of the court to cause the is cue on the plea to be first tried by a special jury, and if found to be true the court shall order the defendant to be delivered to the Superintendent of the Milledgeville State Hospital, there to remain until discharged in the manner prescribed by law . . .</div><div class="casepar">"I further charge you that under Georgia law every person is presumed to be of sound mind and discretion, but the presumption may be rebutted."</div><div class="casepar">Instructions requested by appellant which were denied by the trial court included several requests based on the dissenting opinions in Grace v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../124/01/index.html">231 Ga. 113 (200 SE2d 248)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Read in context, we find no harmful error in the trial judge's instructions in the trial of the special plea of insanity. Code Ann.  26-606, 38-105, 38-106 and 38-107. Grace v. State, supra, concerned the issue of insanity at the time of commission of an alleged criminal offense--not the competence of an accused to stand trial.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, even if the views contained in the dissenting opinions in Grace were held applicable to the trial of a special plea of insanity, the alleged error would be harmless under the evidence in this case. The evidence was overwhelming that appellant was competent to stand trial. See Brown v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">We note that on the trial of the general issue (guilt or innocence) the trial judge included in his instructions to the jury a full, clear and comprehensive charge on insanity which embraced the dissenting opinions in Grace v.

However, in view of the stage of the proceeding when this instruction was given, it was less harmful than the instruction in Hulsey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../118/02/index.html">233 Ga. 261</a></span>, 262 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../118/02/index.html">210 SE2d 797</a></span>) where the trial judge charged the jury the provisions of Code Ann.  27-1503, 88-506.7 prescribing the actions to be taken by the trial judge if a jury returns a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. There, this court held: "Though we have said it is inappropriate to charge the latter part of Code Ann.  27-1503, relating to the consequences of such a verdict by the jury, does the charging of the latter portion of the statute amount to harmful error requiring a reversal? We conclude that charging the latter part of Code Ann.  27-1503 and 88-506.7 in such a case, enough inappropriate, does not amount to harmful error requiring a reversal of the judgment."</div><div class="casepar">As we said in Hulsey, Code Ann.  27-1503, the better practice is not to charge Code  27-1502. However, we conclude there was no reversible error in the instruction given here in the context of the entire charge.</div><div class="casepar">6. In Enumerations 15 and 16, appellant contends that the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court finding the appellant competent to stand trial were decidedly against the weight and strength of the evidence and were contrary to the evidence and law of the case. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">The determination of a preponderance of the evidence is for the jury. This court will not set aside a verdict (or judgment) finding against a special plea of insanity at the time of trial unless it appears that the evidence demands a finding in favor of the plea.

He was oriented as to time and place, remembered events and dates before and after the offenses, his personal history and people with whom he had contact.</div><div class="casepar">The defense attorney testified concerning difficulties he had communicating with the appellant. The thrust of this testimony was that the appellant persisted in claiming that the rape victim was a willing participant.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Clarence M. Johnson, Psychiatrist, Mental Health Center of Waycross, Georgia, testified that he examined the appellant but that his examination was not definitive. In his opinion, the appellant apparently suffered from emotional and psychological problems he characterized as a "lack of emotionality" and a history of combativeness and an inability to get along with others. The doctor testified that, "From the history I obtained from his early behavior that have been sort of anti-social, or against society, his juvenile record, failure to learn from his behavior, from experience, I would say that his ability to feel guilt associated with acts as to whether they are right or wrong, his decisive opinion . . . of what's right or wrong probably is impaired." Subsequently, Dr. Johnson testified that he could not express an opinion at that time as to whether appellant knew right from wrong.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Johnson also stated: "In view of his inappropriate affect or feeling tones along with explosive or impulsive behavior that is sometimes combative and his emotional detachment from stressful events that have happened in the past, it appears we are dealing with the underlying psychiatric disorder." Dr. Johnson concluded his testimony by stating that he had not reached any medical opinion in the case as he was "unable to determine a diagnosis."</div><div class="casepar">The Warden of the Ware Correctional Institution, where the appellant was confined prior to his escape, characterized the appellant as normal as any other inmate. The prison medical technician expressed the same opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Under these circumstances, we hold that the evidence was more than ample to support a finding against the special plea of insanity and to determine that appellant was competent to stand trial.

These enumerations are not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">11. In Enumeration 40, appellant complains that the trial court erred in unduly restricting defense counsel's cross examination of the witness W. E. Strickland, Sheriff of Ware County, Georgia.

During his questioning of Warden Brown, appellant's counsel challenged the records on the ground that the names on two of the records of prior convictions were spelled differently than that of the appellant. Thereafter, Gary Hull, investigator for the district attorney, Augusta Judicial Circuit, testified that he investigated the crimes reported by the two records of conviction and that the appellant was the person represented by those two records. Appellant objected that he had not been advised Gary Hull would be called. The district attorney stated in his place that at the time this original trial started he did not have the name of this individual. Indeed, the necessity for this witness did not arise until appellant's counsel challenged the records during Warden Brown's testimony. Although Warden Brown's testimony at first may have seemed superfluous, once the convictions were attacked for misnomer, the testimony of Gary Hull was admissible as was the testimony of J. E. Murhee, Deputy Sheriff, Ware County concerning an admission by appellant that he already had a sentence of life imprisonment. The indictments in each case likewise became relevant for connection with appellant.</div><div class="casepar">Gary Hull in his testimony referred to the condition of the victim of one of the prior convictions when he found her. In addition to ruling that testimony out when given, the trial court instructed the jury in the clearest terms as follows: "I instruct the jury that they are not to consider any testimony of that particular witness other than just testimony of identification." The transcript does not show that the photographs of the victim in the prior convictions were ever shown to the jury in this case.
