A provision included in a bond required by and given pursuant to statute is void if the provision is not one that is authorized by the statute.</div><div class="casepar">2. The averments in a plea of recoupment must be as full, clear, certain and definite in setting out the defendant's demand as his allegations would be if he were a plaintiff asserting the demand in an original declaration.</div><div class="casepar">3. The trial judge, having correctly dismissed the plea of recoupment upon general demurrer, did not err in disallowing an amendment to defendant's answer defectively seeking to reassert the same demand for recoupment.</div><div class="casepar">Southwest Steel Products brought this action against H. W. Ivey Construction Company, Inc., and Standard Accident Insurance Company to recover $3,779.80 allegedly due the plaintiff as a subcontractor of defendant Ivey, the general contractor in a public school construction project of the DeKalb County Board of Education. The defendant insurance company was surety upon Ivey's performance bond.</div><div class="casepar">To the petition defendant Ivey filed its answer and "plea of setoff and recoupment," so-called. The defendant surely filed general and special demurrers and its answer.</div><div class="casepar">After a hearing on the demurrers, the trial judge overruled all the defendant surety's demurrers to the petition, sustained plaintiff's special demurrers to Ivey's answer, deferred ruling on the general demurrers to Ivey's answer and gave Ivey leave to amend within twenty days.</div><div class="casepar">In response to the order sustaining plaintiff's special demurrers, Ivey amended its answer so that the following allegations were then extant in its counter claim: "Under the terms of Article IX (a) of the contract between plaintiff and this defendant, plaintiff undertook to indemnify defendant against 'all claims for damages arising from accidents to persons or property occasioned by the subcontractor (plaintiff), his agents or employees.'. . . This defendant was required to expend the sum of $4,219.51 as a consequence of plaintiff's failure to perform in a sufficiently workmanlike manner the shoring and bracing of the framework called for in plaintiff's subcontract . . . which failure properly to perform the shoring and bracing caused a collapse of the formwork when the concrete was poured into said forms. When the formwork collapsed, concrete and debris fell onto boilers, electrical work and reinforcing steel which damage this defendant was required to have repaired and for which this defendant seeks to recoup from plaintiff herein." The counter claim alleged a balance due plaintiff of $3,433, and sought to recover the difference between this amount and $4,219.51.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff met this amendment by filing additional general and special demurrers to Ivey's answer, and the trial judge subsequently sustained all the latter demurrers and dismissed Ivey's counter claim.</div><div class="casepar">Thereafter Ivey sought by amendment to strike every paragraph of its counter claim, previously dismissed, and to substitute other allegations demanding recoupment for the same incident previously alleged in its answer. Upon plaintiff's objection the trial judge disallowed the amendment.</div><div class="casepar">The case came on for trial and resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendants except to various orders of the court on the demurrers filed in the case, to the order disallowing Ivey's amendment, to the orders denying defendants' motions for nonsuit and for a directed verdict, and to the judgments denying defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and their motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">1. The petition under consideration did not allege compliance with the following conditions present in the bond involved in this suit. "No suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by any claimant . . . Unless claimant shall have given written notice to any two of the following: The Principal, the Owner, or the Surety above named, within ninety (90) days after such claimant did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of the materials for which said claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the materials were furnished, or for whom the work or labor was done or performed."</div><div class="casepar">The correctness of the trial judge's orders overruling the defendant insurance company's demurrers numbered 1, 2, 3 and 5 rests on the determination of whether the bond under review is a conventional or a statutory one. If held to be a conventional bond the demurrers of the defendant insurance company should have been sustained as the petition failed to state a cause of action since it omitted to allege compliance with all essential condition present in the bond. See Code  103-103. If held to be a statutory bond given in compliance with Code Ann.  23-1705, the omitted condition must be read out of its terms and the failure to allege compliance with it was proper. Talmadge v. General Cas. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../710/17/index.html">88 Ga. App. 234 (76 SE2d 562)</a></span>; Home Indem. Co. v. Battey Machinery Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../659/39/index.html">109 Ga. App. 322</a></span>, 326 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../659/39/index.html">136 SE2d 193</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The construction project involved was an addition to the Avondale High School building and was within the jurisdiction of the DeKalb County Board of Education. By its terms the bond in question covered the contract of construction and named the DeKalb County Board of Education as obligee. Clearly it is a bond given in compliance with Code Ann.  23-1705 and is therefore a statutory bond. The bond was complete as a statutory bond and conformed with the statute except as to the above quoted condition which the statute does not authorize.</div><div class="casepar">"The validity of a bond given in compliance with a statute, and which meets the requirements of the statute is not affected or its nature changed by the inclusion in the bond of a condition that is either not authorized or is repugnant to the statute, except in the instances where the law expressly provides that a bond not made strictly in accordance with the statute is void . . . No law declares that a bond given in compliance with Code  23-1705 but which included a condition not authorized by the statute is void or invalid." St. Paul-Mercury Indem Co. v. Koppers Co., Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../694/93/index.html">95 Ga. App. 687</a></span>, 696 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../694/93/index.html">99 SE2d 275</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The cases of American Surety Co. v. Small Quarries Co., <span class="casemissing">157 Ga. 33</span>, 34-35 (<span class="casemissing">120 SE 617</span>) and Hannah v. Lovelace-Young Lumber Co., <span class="casemissing">159 Ga. 856</span>, 858 (<span class="casemissing">127 SE 225</span>), cited by the defendant surety, are distinguished in the Koppers Co. case, supra, and the distinctions there are applicable here.</div><div class="casepar">The petition was not defective by reason of failing to allege compliance with an unauthorized condition in a statutory bond.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court properly overruled the insurance company's demurrers 1, 2, 3, and 5. The exceptions to the remaining demurrers of this defendant were abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">2. While defendant Ivey's counter claim in the amended answer arose from an incident that might under appropriate allegations furnish a basis for recovery in tort either by Ivey or by third persons, yet the counter claim sounds in contract as a plea of recoupment under a provision of the same contract upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover. "Recoupment is a right of the defendant to have a deduction from the amount of the plaintiff's damages, for the reason that the plaintiff has not complied with the cross-obligations or independent covenants arising under the same contract." Code  20-1311; Commercial Credit Co., Inc. v. Anthony, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 725</span>, 726 (<span class="casemissing">173 SE 204</span>). "Recoupment may be pleaded in all actions ex contractu, where from any reason the plaintiff under the same contract is in good conscience liable to defendant." Code  20-1314; Middleton v. Pruden, <span class="casemissing">191 Ga. 893</span>, 900 (<span class="casemissing">14 SE2d 82</span>).</div><div class="casepar">However, the averments in a plea of recoupment must be as full, clear, certain and definite in setting out the defendant's demand as his allegations would be if he were a plaintiff asserting the demand in an original declaration. Atlanta Glass Co. v. Noizet, <span class="casemissing">88 Ga. 43</span>, 44 (<span class="casemissing">13 SE 833</span>); Cook v. Cobb &amp; Roper, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. App. 328</span>, 329 (<span class="casemissing">95 SE 1022</span>); Byrom v. Ringe, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../720/99/index.html">83 Ga. App. 234</a></span>, 241 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../720/99/index.html">63 SE2d 235</a></span>). This obviously means that as against general demurrer a plea of recoupment is subject to the same test of sufficiency as a petition. Under numerous decisions of our appellate courts, the final test of the sufficiency of a petition to withstand general demurrer is whether the defendant can admit all the plaintiff's allegations and still escape liability. See Code  81-304; Frazier v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 590</span>, 597 (<span class="casemissing">37 SE2d 774</span>); Johnson v. John Deere Plow Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/00/index.html">214 Ga. 645</a></span>, 648 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/00/index.html">106 SE2d 901</a></span>); Ayers v. Baker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../168/26/index.html">216 Ga. 132</a></span>, 136 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../168/26/index.html">114 SE2d 847</a></span>). Ivey's counter claim fails to meet this test.</div><div class="casepar">It was incumbent upon Ivey to show as a condition precedent to its right of recoupment under the indemnity provision, that it suffered damage by reason of a claim for which defendant was liable to some third person because of an accident occasioned by the plaintiff, its agents or employees. While we perceive from the sketchy allegations of the counter claim that there was an accident, other necessary allegations of fulfillment of the condition precedent are missing from Ivey's demand. There are no properly pleaded allegations of fact showing that the accident was "occasioned" by the plaintiff, its agents or employees, or that there was a claim against Ivey or that Ivey was damaged in any way.</div><div class="casepar">While Ivey alleged that the accident was caused by plaintiff's "failure properly to perform the shoring and bracing" and that Ivey "was required to have repaired" certain property damage at Ivey's expense, this is not enough. The allegations are vague, indefinite, uncertain and conclusory as well. "A general demurrer only admits facts well pleaded. Where allegations are equivocal, doubtful, or subject to different interpretations, they will be construed most strongly against the pleader." Hoffman v. Chester, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 296</span>, 307 (<span class="casemissing">49 SE2d 760</span>); State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../686/34/index.html">98 Ga. App. 46</a></span>, 55 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../686/34/index.html">104 SE2d 725</a></span>). " 'The allegations of a petition must be construed most strongly against the pleader, and only facts well pleaded and not the conclusions of the pleader, are admitted by the demurrer.' Ford v. S. A. Lynch Corp., <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 481</span>, 484 (<span class="casemissing">54 SE2d 320</span>). 'In construing a petition on general demurrer, the court will consider that the plaintiff intended to serve his own best interests and will construe the allegations of the petition most strongly against the pleader, and if any inference unfavorable to the rights of the party claiming [a] right may be fairly drawn from the allegations of the petition, this will be done.' Tarver v. Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../691/86/index.html">96 Ga. App. 491</a></span>, 494 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../691/86/index.html">100 SE2d 616</a></span>). 'It is the general rule that when considered on demurrer, pleadings must be construed most strongly against the pleader, and the absence of averments of essential facts and reliance by the pleader upon allegations short of such facts require a holding that they did not exist.' Hulsey v. Interstate Life &amp;c. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../194/42/index.html">207 Ga. 167 (60 SE2d 353)</a></span>." Hardigree v. Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../665/14/index.html">107 Ga. App. 406</a></span>, 407 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../665/14/index.html">130 SE2d 275</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge did not err in sustaining certain general demurrers directed to Ivey's plea of recoupment. No ruling is required of this court on exceptions to orders of the trial judge on other general and special demurrers to Ivey's plea, and the correct sustaining of general demurrers for the reasons discussed above renders moot the remaining issues raised by demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">3. The trial judge having ruled on the merits of Ivey's plea of recoupment, the order sustaining general demurrers to the plea properly established the law of the case adversely to Ivey. Whiteway Neon-Ad., Inc. v. Maddox, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/07/index.html">211 Ga. 915</a></span>, 916 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/07/index.html">89 SE2d 650</a></span>); Bridges v. Avery &amp; Sons Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../714/25/index.html">86 Ga. App. 9 (2) (70 SE2d 550)</a></span>.
