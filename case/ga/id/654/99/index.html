DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Guess.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, Chief Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar"> The evidence authorized the award of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation denying compensation and the superior court erred in reversing it.</div><div class="casepar">This is an appeal by an employer, Scottdale Mills, and its insurance carrier from the judgment of the superior court, reversing the awards of the full Workmen's Compensation Board denying compensation on the ground that the claimant had failed to carry the burden of proof of an injury in an accident arising in and out of the course of his employment. The following evidence was adduced at the hearing: The claimant collapsed on the premises of the employer on June 25, 1963, with what was later diagnosed as a complete fracture of the right femur (leg) near the hip, the claimant having sustained, at some previous time, a non-displaced, or line, fracture of that bone. There was medical testimony that a leg with such a fracture frequently could be used for three or four weeks before the fracture became complete. The claimant's job was doff spinning, which consisted of taking off full bobbins and replacing them with empty ones, requiring him to pull a frame down by putting one foot (he testified he used his right one) on a lever some 12 to 18 inches off the floor and exerting some pressure to push it down to the floor. The claimant testified that on Monday, May 27, 1963, one particular frame was "awful hard" to push down and that he felt a stinging sensation in his right leg afterwards. A fellow employee testified that he had worked the same machines as the claimant had on that day and that he could not tell that some frames were more difficult to push than others. Tom Lumpkin; a fellow employee, testified that on a Saturday night he and the claimant were leaving the mill together after having gotten off work; that the gate had not been opened at that time; that the night watchman who had the gate key was not at the gate at that time; that the claimant had told him that he would climb over the nearly 8 foot tall gate as he had done for 20 years; that Lumpkin went to get the key because he couldn't climb the fence; that, as he was leaving to get the key, he saw the claimant climb the fence; that, although he didn't see him jump or climb down the other side, he saw him cranking his automobile when he returned with the night watchman; that on the next Monday (May 27) the claimant had told him at 5:30, two and a half hours after having started working, that his leg was sore and hurting and that the doctor had told him he had a pulled muscle in his leg and he requested that Lumpkin pull down some of his frames for him; that the claimant had not complained about his leg nor mentioned seeing a doctor about</div><div class="casepar">it prior to that time. John Wells, a night watchman, testified that he remembered the fence climbing incident testified to by Lumpkin, although he did not know the identity of the climber; that he had reported to the employer the fact that employees were climbing over the fence; that the employer had warned the employees that they would be fired if they were caught jumping the fence. The claimant denied both that he had climbed over the fence on Saturday, May 25, and that he had told Lumpkin on the following Monday about his leg's hurting, the doctor having said he had a pulled muscle, etc. Dr. Huff testified that the nature of the claimant's injury was such as would indicate that such an injury would be more likely caused by climbing over such a high fence than by pushing on a pedal, such as was involved in the claimant's job.</div><div class="casepar">The burden of establishing the causal connection between the accident and the alleged injury was upon the claimant. Wilcox v. Shepherd Lumber Corp., <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. App. 71 (55 SE2d 382)</span>; Harper v. National Traffic Guard Co., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 385</span>, 387 (<span class="casemissing">36 SE2d 842</span>). The principal evidence introduced by the claimant to carry this burden consisted of his own testimony, that he had hurt his leg on May 27 while pushing down a frame which was hard to push and Dr. Huff's testimony that such an injury could have been caused by his pushing on the pedal. Most of his evidence was contradicted by contrary testimony. Dr. Huff qualified his testimony as to the possibility of the injury's occurring from working on the machine by saying that this would be true if it were done clumsily or if his foot slipped off the pedal, etc., neither of which was shown by the evidence to have happened. A fellow worker testified that none of the pedals seemed unusually difficult to push. Although the evidence, as set out in the statement of facts hereinabove, would not demand a finding that the injury in fact was caused by the claimant's going over the fence, whether by climbing, jumping or falling, or a combination of these, it did authorize the finding that he had gone over it in some manner and this, combined with Dr. Huff's testimony, that climbing such a fence would be a more probable cause of such an injury, further weakened the claimant's contended version of the cause of the injury. The claimant's denial of having climbed the fence on that particular Saturday before the Monday on which he contends his injury occurred and his denial of having mentioned, only two and a half hours after commencing work on that Monday, the fact of his injury and his having been to a doctor, had to be weighed by the trior of fact against the contrary testimony of disinterested witnesses. The weight and credit to be given to the testimony of the witnesses and also the conflicts in the evidence are matters for determination by the board, Weathers v. American Cas. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../696/91/index.html">94 Ga. App. 530 (1) (95 SE2d 436)</a></span> and cases cited, and an award will not be set aside by the court when the solution depends, as it does here, on the credibility of the witnesses and no fraud appears. Ocean Accident &amp;c. Corp. v. Dean, <span class="casemissing">44 Ga. App. 220 (160 SE 823)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">The claimant having failed to carry the burden of establishing the causal connection between the accident and the injury, the board did not err in its award denying compensation. The finding of the deputy director and the full board, that "jumping from the top of such a fence" was the more probable cause of the alleged injury, while not authorized by the evidence, is not reversible error, since the award was otherwise authorized by competent evidence. See American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Sisson, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 623 (32 SE2d 295)</span>; Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hodges, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/55/index.html">108 Ga. App. 474</a></span>, 475 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/55/index.html">133 SE2d 406</a></span>) and cit.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the court erred in its judgment reversing the award of the board denying compensation.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
