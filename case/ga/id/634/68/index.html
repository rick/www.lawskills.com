Savannah City Court. Before Judge Oliver.</div><div class="casepresiding">JORDAN, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The court did not err in approving so much of the report of the auditor, and rendering judgment thereon, to the extent that the auditor determined, as to the arrangement in effect after June 15, 1965, that the defendant, as a special agent of an insurance company working under a general agent, is obligated to repay the plaintiff, the general agent, the excess of payments over earned commissions.</div><div class="casepar">3. The court erred in approving so much of the report of the auditor, and rendering judgment thereon, to the extent that the auditor determined that the promissory note given by the defendant, as a special agent of an insurance company, to the plaintiff, the general agent, is not an enforceable agreement between the parties for the principal amount claimed by the plaintiff in settlement of transactions before June 15, 1965, plus interest and attorney's fees as provided in the note, subject to the stipulations contained therein for correcting errors in the accounting on which the amount of the note is based.</div><div class="casepar">Allen commenced this action against Daniels to recover an indebtedness allegedly due on account of transactions in connection with their relationship of general agent and special agent, respectively, representing the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. The lower court, on application of the plaintiff, referred the matter to an auditor to pass on all questions of law and fact, and upon receiving his report, in which the auditor concludes that the defendant owes the plaintiff $2,465.94, and a hearing on the objections thereto, overruled the objections of both parties, and adopted the report of the auditor as the judgment of the court. The defendant appeals and the plaintiff cross appeals.</div><div class="casepar">1. Although the defendant on the main appeal filed two enumerations, he confines his brief to a single issue, whether Paragraph 22 of the Special Agent's Commission Agreement "constitutes an agreement to repay advances in excess of earned commissions when without an agreement such advances could not be collected." This paragraph provides that, "If the company shall for any reason refund any premium, the special agent shall lose all right to commissions on such premium, and shall pay to the general agent, the full amount received by him on account thereof. If the general agent, for any reason, pays to the special agent a commission in advance of the payment of the premium and the premium is not subsequently collected from the policy owner, the special agent shall repay such commission to the general agent on demand."</div><div class="casepar">Commencing on or about June 15, 1965, the parties entered into what the auditor denominates the "Second Arrangement" whereby the only formal contract remaining in effect was the Special Agent's Commission Agreement containing the excerpt set forth above. The plaintiff, without obtaining any specific further agreement beyond the terms of this contract regarding the repayment of advances, committed himself to pay or advance $600 per month to the defendant if production remained at a certain level. In a letter dated October 6, 1965, however, he disclosed his dissatisfaction, and referring to the monthly advances as a subsidy, expressed a willingness to advance 1/2 of the previous amount, plus 1/2 of the commissions payable on business reported paid to the defendant's credit after October 1, 1965. The defendant resigned in November. It is undisputed that the plaintiff paid the defendant $3,048.31 during this period, and the auditor credited the defendant with earned commissions of $1,480.23 as alleged by plaintiff and to the favor of the defendant, an amount in excess of the amount the defendant testified he earned. The auditor concluded that in this aspect of the case the defendant owed the plaintiff the difference of $1,568.08, and avoided the rule in Wilson v. Nauman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../711/49/index.html">88 Ga. App. 782 (1) (77 SE2d 756)</a></span>, to the effect that absent any express or implied agreement to repay, a principal cannot recover the excess of advances over earned commissions, by determining that Paragraph 22 of the formal agreement was "an agreement by the defendant to repay advances in excess of earned commissions."</div><div class="casepar">As we understand the contentions of the defendant, however, the payment to him of a flat monthly rate, which the plaintiff referred to as a subsidy, was as if he were on a guaranteed monthly salary, and not as if he were a commission salesman, and thus outside the provisions of Paragraph 22, or more particularly the second clause of this paragraph.</div><div class="casepar">While the construction placed on Paragraph 22 by the auditor is somewhat broader than the literal language of the agreement, since the strict terms of the agreement do not cover all advances, but only advance commissions, we think the meager evidence as disclosed in the report does authorize a determination that the flat rate monthly payments were intended by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant as advances (the plaintiff in his correspondence appears to use "subsidy" and "advances" as synonymous terms) based on commissions potentially earned, and thus subject to repayment if never earned, for it is clear that the payments were commenced by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant on the condition of production at a certain level, and were lowered when the production did not meet these expectations, and that they were never intended or accepted as an outright subsidy, repayable only to the extent of credit for earned commissions.</div><div class="casepar">2. Under the present appellate practice it does not follow from the result reached on the main appeal in this case that the cross appeal is subject to dismissal even though, standing alone, the ruling on the main appeal requires that the judgment of the lower court be affirmed. We recognize, of course, that situations do arise where the judgment of this court on the main appeal leaves nothing for adjudication in the lower court, and that in such cases it is appropriate to dismiss the cross appeal. See Carpenter v. Stanley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../632/30/index.html">118 Ga. App. 113 (162 SE2d 761)</a></span>. The Act provides in pertinent part, however, that "the appellee may present for adjudication on the cross appeal all errors or rulings adversely affecting him, and in no case shall the appellee be required to institute an independent appeal on his own right, although the appellee may at his option file an independent appeal." Ga. L. 1965, pp. 18, 21; Ga. L. 1966, pp. 493, 496 (Code Ann.  6-803). Even if the main appeal be dismissed, it does not invalidate the cross appeal if the appellee would stand to benefit by a decision thereon. Ga. L. 1965, pp. 18, 29 and pp. 240, 241 (Code Ann.  6-809 (c)). Moreover, although the plaintiff designates his appeal as a cross appeal, the notice is sufficient in substance and was filed in time (see Code Ann.  102-102 (8)) to meet the requirements for an independent appeal.</div><div class="casepar">3. The three issues raised by the cross appeal are based on the refusal of the auditor, as approved by the court, to recognize an instrument executed to terminate what the auditor denominates the "First Arrangement," which purports to cover indebtedness to June 15, 1965, as an enforceable promissory note, including interest and attorney's fees as provided therein, or, with a letter from the plaintiff dated June 17, 1965, as showing an account stated. The auditor actually allowed the plaintiff $897.86 under the "First Arrangement," which the defendant admitted he owed, concluding, in order to reach this result, the absence of an enforceable agreement or an account stated, and that the evidence did not sustain the plaintiff's claim of $1,811.46 due under the note, plus interest and attorney's fees.</div><div class="casepar">The instrument, regular on its face as a promissory note payable on demand for a stated amount, with interest at 6% per annum, plus 15% attorney's fees if collected by law or through an attorney, additionally provides that, "Should subsequent investigation prove this figure (totalling $4,458.67 as above) to be in error I [Jack A. Daniels] agree to amend this note to the proper amount if it be increased and John L. Allen agrees to reduce it should it be a lesser amount." The letter from the plaintiff, in which he forwarded the note to the defendant for signature, purports to detail how the plaintiff arrived at the amount of the indebtedness.</div><div class="casepar">This being an action by the payee against the maker of the note we think it is immaterial whether the conditions placed on the promise to pay a sum certain upon the subsequent discovery of errors in the accounting render the sum uncertain and invalidate the instrument as negotiable paper within the requirements of  3-104 (b), 3-105, and 3-106, of the Uniform Commercial Code--Commercial Paper. See Ga. L. 1962, pp. 156, 239-241; Code Ann.  109A-3--104 (b), 109A-3--105, 109A-3--106. Assuming that the note was non-negotiable because the stipulated sum was subject to adjustment upon the discovery of errors in the accounting (see, in this connection, First Nat. Bank of Dothan v. Elba Hardware &amp;c. Co., 222 Ala. 493 (<span class="casemissing">137 SE 173</span>)), the note nevertheless discloses a contract between the parties, the intent of which is clearly discernible, a promise to pay $1,458.67 on demand, plus interest, and attorney's fees if collected by law or through an attorney, based on all indebtedness "arising from the chargeback of expense allowances paid, annualized commissions unearned, and other advances" before June 15, 1965, subject to adjustment in amount upon the discovery of any error in the accounting. We think it should be enforced in accordance with its terms.</div><div class="casepar">In a somewhat analogous situation the Supreme Court of this State remarked: "The general rule of the law, as applicable to the facts of this case, undoubtedly is, that if the defendant signed the drafts with a full knowledge of the state of the accounts, and in liquidation or settlement of the same (in the absence of any fraud, accident or mistake) he is prima facie bound thereby for the payment of the money expressed therein, and if there is any fact or facts going to show that it was not the intention of the parties that the drafts should be a full and final settlement and compromise of the subject matter of the accounts for which the drafts were given, the burden of proof to show such fact or facts is upon the defendant, and he should rebut the presumption of the law against him by clear and satisfactory evidence." The transaction showed an accord, but not a satisfaction. McLendon v. Wilson, Callaway &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. 42</span>, 46.</div><div class="casepar">Viewed in the light of the foregoing principles we think the face amount of the note establishes prima facie the amount of the original indebtedness of the defendant to the plaintiff incurred before June 15, 1965, less those credits which the plaintiff admittedly recognizes to reduce the principal to $1,811.46, and that the burden rests on the party asserting error to show error, and specifically on the defendant to produce evidence, as a matter of affirmative defense, to show any errors in the accounting to reduce the amount further, as well as any subsequent payments or credits, short of the admitted indebtedness of $897.86, and that the plaintiff is also entitled to interest and attorney's fee in accordance with the provisions of the note.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed on the main appeal; reversed on the cross appeal with direction for further action not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion. Pannell, J., concurs. Deen, J., concurs in the judgment.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Connerat, Dunn, Hunter, Houlihan, Maclean &amp; Exley, Malcolm Maclean, for appellee.</div><div class="caselawyer">Brannen, Clark &amp; Hester, Perry Brannen, Jr., for appellant.</div></div><div class="casechrono">SUBMITTED SEPTEMBER 10, 1968 -- DECIDED NOVEMBER 26, 1968.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="caseinlinks"><div class="header">
