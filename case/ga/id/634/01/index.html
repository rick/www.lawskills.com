An application for appointment of a third arbitrator, under Code Ann.  92-6912, is not one addressed to the superior court as such, but only to the judge thereof for the sole purpose of appointing such arbitrator. Upon such application, he has no jurisdiction to adjudicate other matters, such as the qualification of the arbitrators appointed by the parties or the qualification of any successors to those already appointed.</div><div class="casepar">2. Where it appears that even if the rulings complained of be reversed the appellant would derive no benefit from the adjudication and such alleged errors. are harmless, the rulings will be affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">3. Questions relating to whether the appeal should be dismissed are not decided.</div><div class="casepar">Statement of facts. This is an appeal from an order entered in six separate cases which were consolidated for argument in the trial court. The appellee taxpayers filed a petition or application to the Superior Court of Muscogee County seeking the appointment by the judge of the superior court of a third arbitrator pursuant to Code Ann.  92-6912 as amended and for leave of court to substitute an arbitrator for the one originally named by the taxpayers when they made their demand for arbitration, and naming the successor arbitrator. It appeared from the allegations that the county had named its arbitrator and that the two arbitrators had been unable to agree upon the third and, further, that the arbitrator appointed by the taxpayers desired to withdraw and the petitioners named a new arbitrator. A rule nisi was issued and served upon the defendant board of tax assessors. The answer of the tax board set forth the following defenses so far as here material: "First Defense. 1. Said petition states no cause of action. 2. Said petition states no cause of action in equity and sets forth no grounds or basis for equitable relief, whatsoever. 3. Said equitable relief sought in said petition is vague, uncertain and indefinite. 4. Said petition should abate and be dismissed for the reason that there is no provision in law for the relief sought by petitioners, and that there is certainly no right for this court to allow a substitution of arbitrators, inasmuch as the statutory time for the appointment of such arbitrators has expired. 5. That this petition should abate for the reason that this court has no equitable or legal right to stop any governmental agent or authority from proceeding as provided by Georgia law. Second Defense. 6. These defendants show that there is no such provision in Georgia law, that the statutory time for the appointment of an arbitrator has expired, and that said taxpayers have no right to appoint another arbitrator. Further, the defendants show that the said James E. Hendrix [the successor named] is disqualified to act as an arbitrator. 8. Defendants admit that the property owners have requested judicial supervision of the arbitration, but show that there is no such power in Georgia law to supervise the same, except as provided by Georgia statutes." Prayers of the defendants' answer were: "(A) That said action be dismissed; (B) That plaintiff be directed to</div><div class="casepar">purge inconsistent and vague matters from said petition; (C) That the relief requested by plaintiff be denied; (D) That the court find that the assessment made by the board of tax assessors be entered on the Tax Digest of Muscogee County, Georgia, in place of any award made by a board of arbitrators; (E) That if necessary, defendants have trial by jury." At the hearing, it was stipulated that the arbitrator appointed by the taxpayers was the husband and father of the taxpayers. At the hearing, the defendants contended that the first arbitrator named by the taxpayers was disqualified. The trial judge also refused to permit the defendants to examine the second appointee of the taxpayers to determine whether or not he was qualified on the grounds that no specific attack had been made on his qualification. The trial court entered the following order: "It was stipulated that Kenneth E. White, Jr., the arbitrator named by Elizabeth Heard White, is the husband of Elizabeth Heard White and is the son-in-law of Elizabeth D. Heard.</div><div class="casepar">"Movant offered to withdraw Kenneth E. White, Jr., as arbitrator and to appoint James E. Hendrix as substitute arbitrator if the tax assessors objected to Kenneth E. White, Jr., as an arbitrator on the grounds of his relationship to the movant or if the tax assessors did not insist upon their objection to Kenneth E. White, Jr., to proceed with the arbitration. The tax assessors insisted upon their objections to Kenneth E. White, Jr., as an arbitrator and objected to the allowance of any substitution.</div><div class="casepar">"The motion of the tax assessors to dismiss the application of Elizabeth Heard White is denied.</div><div class="casepar">"After hearing argument of counsel, the objection of the tax assessors to Kenneth E. White, Jr. as an arbitrator is sustained.</div><div class="casepar">"The tax assessors having further questioned the qualification of James E. Hendrix in their answer but having failed and refused to state any ground of disqualification, the court hereby finds that James E. Hendrix is qualified.</div><div class="casepar">"So ordered, this 1st day of July, 1968."</div><div class="casepar">The enumerations of error were as follows: "1. The court committed error in allowing the petitions in these cases to be filed in said court as set forth in the court's order of June 25, 1968. 2. In entering its order of July 1, 1968. 3. The trial court committed error in failing to sustain paragraph 1 of appellants' first defense, which pleaded that the petition of appellees stated no cause of action. 4. The trial court committed error in failing to sustain paragraph 2 of appellants' first defense, which pleaded that the petition of appellees stated no cause of action for equitable relief, and in not dismissing said petition. 5. The trial court committed error in failing to sustain the motion of appellants set forth in paragraph 3 of their first defense, and in not dismissing said petition. 6. The trial court committed error in failing to sustain appellants' motion to dismiss as contained in paragraph 4 of the first defense which objected to the prayers that the court allow a substitution of arbitrators, and in allowing a substitution of parties. 7. The court committed error in finding that James E. Hendrix was qualified as an appraiser when the court specifically refused to allow appellants to question the said Hendrix as to his qualifications." Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. Code  92-6912 as amended by the Act of 1958 (Ga. L. 1958, p. 387), relating to the arbitration of disputes between the taxpayer and boards of tax assessors, provides that after the taxpayer and the board shall have named their respective arbitrators, "in the event the two arbitrators provided for in this section fail to name a third within 20 days after their appointment, he shall be named by the judge of the superior court of the county wherein the property lies." It will be noted that the appointment of the third arbitrator must be made by the judge of the superior court of the county where the land lies rather than the court itself. The court itself has no jurisdiction of the matter, but the judge of that court has jurisdiction, but only an administrative jurisdiction to appoint the third arbitrator. The person holding the office of judge is the one designated to do the appointing, not the court itself acting through the judge. No judicial power is conferred. See in this connection Little v. McCalla, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. App. 324 (3) (93 SE 37)</span>; Gas Light Co. v. West, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. 318</span>. It follows therefore that the judge of the superior court, acting as such, upon an application to appoint a third arbitrator under the statute, had no jurisdiction to make any other or additional determinations. The superior court, in a case properly before it, such as injunction suits, in which these matters can be raised for decision, may make such adjudications. See Candler v. Gilbert, <span class="casemissing">180 Ga. 679 (180 SE 723)</span>; Cresswill v. Knights of Pythias, <span class="casemissing">133 Ga. 837</span>, 847 (2) (<span class="casemissing">67 SE 188</span>, 134 ASR 231, 18 AC 453).</div><div class="casepar">2. Even though there be error in the grant of part of the relief prayed for, this is not cause for reversal here as the errors alleged are harmless and a reversal would be of no benefit to the appellant.

Peacock, <span class="casemissing">114 Ga. 691</span> (<span class="casemissing">40 SE 757</span>, 88 ASR 53); Bullock v. Dunbar, <span class="casemissing">114 Ga. 754 (40 SE 783)</span>; Lee v.

Burnham, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../170/49/index.html">215 Ga. 57 (108 SE2d 706)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Under the stipulated facts, the original appointee was the husband and son-in-law respectively of the appellee taxpayers and was thus disqualified (Vestel v. Edwards, <span class="casemissing">143 Ga. 368 (2) (85 SE 187)</span>), and the appellees were entitled to appoint a successor without any order of the court. See Candler v. Gilbert, <span class="casemissing">180 Ga. 679</span>, 682 (9), supra. At this point, however, we run sharply counter to the contentions of the appellant who strenuously insists that the appointment of a disqualified arbitrator by the appellees constituted "a failure to avail themselves of the lawfully constituted tribunal to arbitrate the assessments," as the demand for arbitration was ineffective when accompanied by the appointment of a disqualified arbitrator, citing as authority for their contention the third division of the opinion in Candler v. Gilbert, supra, p. 680, which reads as follows: "The court was authorized to find that the only arbitrator appointed by the taxpayers was legally disqualified because of pecuniary interest, and that there was a failure to avail themselves of the lawfully constituted tribunal to arbitrate the assessments. Compare Vestel v. Edwards, <span class="casemissing">143 Ga. 368 (85 SE 187)</span>; Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U. S. 240 (54 SC 146)." While this statement, standing alone, might seem to authorize such construction, yet when the facts of that case and all the holdings therein are considered, it is apparent that two separate findings by the trial judge were authorized and that the later finding authorized was not based upon the disqualification of the arbitrator appointed by the taxpayers, but upon the facts that the taxpayers claimed that the board of arbitrators was not properly constituted because the member appointed by the tax board was disqualified, and at the time set for the hearing neither the taxpayers nor their arbitrator attended. The court also held the arbitrator chosen by the tax board was qualified. These facts, when considered in connection with Division 8 of the opinion, demonstrate the correctness of our construction. Division 8 of the opinion is as follows: "8. Petitioners demanded an arbitration on their tax returns, and named an arbitrator to represent them. An arbitrator was appointed to represent the board of tax assessors. The arbitrator selected by the taxpayers was legally disqualified to act, by reason of pecuniary interest in the amount of the reductions sought, and there was a failure by the parties to agree upon a third arbitrator or umpire. The first named arbitrator refused to act further. The umpire was duly appointed as provided by law. There being no qualified successor to the taxpayers' representative appointed, the two lawfully appointed assessors proceeded to assess the property. Held: (a) The assessments were not void because the umpire was prematurely appointed, or for any other reason assigned. (b) The court was authorized to find that on such failure to participate the two remaining arbitrators could proceed to hear evidence and fix the assessments, in accordance with Code of 1933,  92-6912, which would require the vote of two arbitrators to fix any assessment. McGregor v. Hogan, <span class="casemissing">153 Ga. 473</span>, 480</div><div class="casepar">(<span class="casemissing">112 SE 471</span>)." Candler v. Gilbert, supra, p. 682. It appears, therefore, the ruling in Division 3 that the facts authorized the trial judge to find there was a failure of the taxpayers to avail themselves of the "lawfully constituted tribunal to arbitrate the assessments" referred solely to the taxpayers' refusal to participate in the hearing before the two lawful arbitrators and was not a holding that the "tribunal" was unlawfully constituted and unauthorized to act, or that the demand for arbitration was abortive because of the appointment of a disqualified arbitrator. Accordingly, the rulings of the judge of the superior court in the present case were not necessary to the disqualification of the first arbitrator and the validity of the appointment of the successor, and a reversal on the ground the judge of the superior court had no jurisdiction to enter an order disqualifying the first arbitrator and approving the appointment of a successor would be of no benefit to appellant and the error is harmless.</div><div class="casepar">Error is also enumerated on the action of the trial judge in holding the successor arbitrator qualified. Two grounds are urged: (1) there was no evidence on which to base such a ruling, and (2) the trial judge had no jurisdiction to so rule. Since the appellants, by their answer, sought the determination of the qualification of the successor by alleging in general terms that he was not qualified, and failed to produce evidence of disqualification, they are not now in position to complain of this ruling on this ground. It is true the appellants sought to introduce evidence by seeking to examine the successor arbitrator at the hearing, but they were not permitted to do so; however, no error is enumerated on this action of the trial judge.</div><div class="casepar">We have already determined that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to pass upon the qualification of the successor; however, a reversal would not benefit the appellants by permitting them in this proceeding in the court below to introduce evidence on the question or secure a disqualification of the successor arbitrator. While the rulings in this regard were probably void because of lack of jurisdiction of this subject matter in the proceeding then before the judge of the superior court, and thus subject to attack at any time or any place, we think it best that we affirm with direction that the judge of the superior court vacate his orders so there will be no question raised later that they are res judicata in a case properly involving the matters decided.</div><div class="casepar">3. Whether, upon application of the ruling in American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Kent, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 733 (30 SE 599)</span>, overruling King v. Western Union Telegraph Co., <span class="casemissing">54 Ga. App. 388 (187 SE 888)</span>, the appeal in this case is from a final judgment, or whether it is not from a final judgment for the reason that the judge of the superior court by providing for the entertainment of a subsequent motion to appoint a third arbitrator may have retained jurisdiction to the extent that a case was still pending in the "court below" and the appeal thus be subject to dismissal for failure to secure a proper certificate from the trial judge under the provisions of Section 1 of the Act approved April 8, 1968 (Ga. L. 1968, p. 1072) we do not decide. Neither do we decide whether the appeal should be dismissed because the action of a judge of the superior court upon an application to appoint a third arbitrator under Code Ann.  92-6912 is not appealable, it being an administrative rather than a judicial act (see Gas Light Co. v. West, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. 318</span>), or whether the judge's assumption of judicial functions in this proceeding might have maple the judgment one which would have supported an appeal.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed with direction.
