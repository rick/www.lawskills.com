The judgment of the court below, sustaining the special demurrers to the petition, was not error.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff in error filed an information in the nature of a quo warranto, seeking to inquire into the right of the defendant in error to hold the office of Judge of the Civil Court of DeKalb County. The information alleged in substance: that plaintiff was a citizen and taxpayer of DeKalb County and of the City of Atlanta; that the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division was created by the act of 1913 (Ga. L. 1913, p. 145); that the name of the court was changed to Civil Court of DeKalb County by the act of 1939 (Ga. L. 1939, p. 449); that, by the act of 1927 (Ga. L. 1927, p. 383), the act of 1913 was amended so as to provide: "That any attorney at law who has been practicing law for a period of two years and who is a qualified elector and a resident of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta shall be eligible to hold the office as Judge of the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division . . ."; that defendant was at the time of his appointment a resident of the Panthersville District of DeKalb County; that defendant was at the time of his appointment a qualified elector of the Panthersville District of DeKalb County; that the Panthersville District is outside the City of Atlanta; that defendant is ineligible to hold the office of Judge of the Civil Court of DeKalb County, in that at the time of his appointment he was not a resident of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta; that the defendant is ineligible to hold said office, for the reason that at the time of his appointment he was not a qualified elector of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta; that defendant has assumed the duties of said office and continues to enjoy the privileges and emoluments thereof; that defendant claims title to said office by reason of the appointment and commission of July 31, 1950; that defendant is ineligible to hold said office by virtue of the act of 1927; that the office of Judge of the Civil Court of DeKalb County is a public office; that, unless the writ of quo warranto issues, defendant will continue to illegally discharge the duties of said office. The prayers of the petition are for process and a judgment of ouster.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant in error filed special demurrers to all paragraphs of the petition setting out that defendant was ineligible to hold the office of Judge of the Civil Court of DeKalb County because he was not a qualified elector of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta, as required by sec. 1 of the act of 1927, supra; contending that said act was repealed by sec. 3 of the act of 1929, page 369, which provides: "Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that said judge of the DeKalb Division of the Municipal Court of Atlanta shall be a resident of DeKalb County and of the City of Atlanta, and shall have been engaged in the practice of law at least two years next preceding his appointment hereunder, or shall have been a judge of this court at least two years next preceding his appointment hereunder."</div><div class="casepar">The judge of the court below sustained all special demurrers except the demurrer to paragraph 7, which set out that defendant was a qualified elector of the Panthersville District of DeKalb County, which was overruled. The order provided that plaintiff should have ten days in which to amend, or in default thereof the petition should stand dismissed. Plaintiff filed exceptions pendente lite to this order, and failed to amend within ten days as provided in the order and, at the end of such period, filed a bill of exceptions complaining of the rulings on the special demurrers and of the judgment of dismissal.</div><div class="casepar">It is not contended that the 1929 act expressly repeals the 1927 act, but it is contended that it does so by implication.</div><div class="casepar">There are two instances in which a statute will be deemed to have repealed a prior statute by implication. One is when the provisions of the later are inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of the former act. The other is when the later act deals with and embraces the whole subject-matter of the legislation of the former act. We recognize the well-settled principle in our law that "repeals by implication are not favored and never occur except where the later act is clearly and indubitably contradictory and contrary to the former act . . . In order to bring about a repeal by implication, the legislative intent must be clear, manifest, and irreconcilable with the intent not to repeal." Connor v. O'Brien, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 221</span> (31 S. E. 2d, 399). It is, however, the duty of the courts in the construction of statutes to give effect to the intention of the legislature when it is ascertainable. Thacker v. Morris, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 167</span> (26 S. E. 2d, 329); Thompson v. Eastern Air Lines, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 216</span>, 222 (39 S. E. 2d, 225).</div><div class="casepar">The Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division was established in 1913 (Ga. L. 1913, p. 145 et seq.). The act establishing the court provided for two divisions, the Fulton County Division and the DeKalb County Division. It is only with the latter that we are here concerned. The act provided that the DeKalb Division should have two judges and provided what their qualifications should be. In 1927, the legislature passed an act amending the 1913 act, which, among other things, repealed sec. 6 of the 1913 act--the section dealing with the qualifications of the judges of the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division--and provided that the judges should be lawyers who had been practicing for a period of two years, and further provided that they should be qualified electors and residents of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta, as quoted in the statement of facts.</div><div class="casepar">The act of 1929 amended the act of 1913 as amended by the act of 1927, by repealing sec. 5 of the act of 1913, which provided for two judges of the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division, and substituted therefor sec. 5 as amended, which provided for only one judge of said court, and increased the jurisdiction of the court. The amendment included sec. 3, which deals with the qualifications of the judge of the court and is quoted in the statement of facts. It is this section which it is contended repeals sec. 6 of the act of 1913 as amended by sec. 1 of the act of 1927.</div><div class="casepar">Sec. 6 of the act of 1913 as amended by sec. 1 of the act of visions, the Fulton County Division and the DeKalb County Division. It is only with the latter that we are here concerned. The act provided that the DeKalb Division should have two judges and provided what their qualifications should be. In 1927, the legislature passed an act amending the 1913 act, which, among other things, repealed sec. 6 of the 1913 act--the section dealing with the qualifications of the judges of the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division--and provided that the judges should be lawyers who had been practicing for a period of two years, and further provided that they should be qualified electors and residents of DeKalb County inside the City of Atlanta, as quoted in the statement of facts.</div><div class="casepar">The act of 1929 amended the act of 1913 as amended by the act of 1927, by repealing sec. 5 of the act of 1913, which provided for two judges of the Municipal Court of Atlanta, DeKalb Division, and substituted therefor sec. 5 as amended, which provided for onlry alimony, he was brought from the hospital, where he was under treatment for an ulcerated stomach. His physician made an affidavit, after the rule nisi citing the husband to show cause why he should not be attached for contempt (the rule being issued on August 7), which stated that it was for the purpose of being considered in the hearing on August 18. The hearing was postponed until August 25. In the affidavit the physician stated that, on July 8, the husband was suffering from ulcerated stomach, that at the time he was admitted to the hospital he was hemorrhaging, that he had been under the care and treatment of the physician, and that the husband would not be able to perform any work for a period of thirty days. Under the testimony of the physician, the husband was disabled from performing any work for several weeks prior to the judgment awarding temporary alimony, and was still unable to perform any work when the case was heard on August 25, on the rule nisi to show cause why he should not be attached for contempt. The husband did testify that he was to go to work on August 25 for the Mulberry Market, for 75c per hour, to wrap and sell meat, that he had a job there on Fridays and Saturdays, and would make $15 for two days. He stated that, since the hearing on the application for temporary alimony, the only money he had was that given him by his brother, that his living expenses, room, meals, and medicine had been paid for by his brother, but that his brother had not given him any money that week and his room rent was due on that date. The only other personal property which the husband was shown to have owned, and from which any money might have been realized to apply on the alimony judgment, was the remainder of a small stock, of goods, which the wife took possession of and sold for $45.</div><div class="casepar">From the facts appearing in this record, it cannot be said that the husband had it "reasonably and fairly within his power to comply with the order" of the judge of the superior court, and the judgment finding him in contempt of court must be reversed.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">W.
