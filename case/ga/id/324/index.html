Before Judge Nation.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">In these two child custody disputes, the maternal grandparents challenge the trial court's award of custody to the noncustodial father. The trial courts found in both cases that it would be in the best interest of each child to remain with his grandparents, but struck down the "best-interest-of-the-child" standard in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) as unconstitutional. We granted the grandparents' discretionary applications to determine whether the best-interest-of-the-child standard is constitutional in custody disputes between a parent and a third party. Considering the fundamental rights of parents, we construe the custody statute as requiring the third party to show by clear and convincing evidence that parental custody would harm the child in order to rebut the statutory presumption in favor of the parent. With that narrowing construction, we uphold as constitutional the best interest standard when applied to custody disputes between a biological parent and custodial third party under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1). Therefore, we reverse and remand.</div><div class="casepar">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</div><div class="casepar">Both of these appeals concern a custody dispute between a single, noncustodial parent and relatives who have physical custody of the child. Thus, these cases do not involve the removal of a child from the parent's home, but rather the possible reunification of parent and child. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">S00A1610. Clark v. Wade.</div><div class="casepar">Warren Wade was born in 1994 to Melissa Wright and Douglas Wade and has lived with his maternal grandparents, Margie and James Clark, since 1995. When Warren's parents divorced in 1996, his mother was awarded custody. She left him to be raised by his grandparents, who were already raising his older brother, and Warren's father exercised regular visitation rights. In 1999, Melissa Wright was arrested for a drug violation, and Douglas Wade sought custody of their five-year-old child. The trial court awarded him temporary custody, and the grandparents moved to intervene in the custody proceeding. The trial court found that it would be in the best interest of the child to remain in the custody of the grandparents, but struck down the best interest standard in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) as "constitutionally insufficient" and awarded custody to the father. This Court granted the grandparents' application to appeal to consider whether the statute was unconstitutional under our ruling in Brooks v. Parkerson. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">S00A2014. Driver v. Raines.</div><div class="casepar">Justin Casey Veal was born in 1992 and is the child of Dawn Driver and John Raines, who never married. The child has lived with his mother and maternal grandparents most of his life. The state sought child support from the father in 1995; the father filed a petition for legitimation in 1996; and Justin lived with his father from June 1996 to January 1997. When Justin returned home to his mother and grandparents, he complained about his arm and doctors determined that it had been broken for a week. The father filed a petition for custody, and the maternal grandparents intervened. In response to the father's constitutional challenge, the trial court ruled that  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) failed to articulate any standard and allowed the factfinder to substitute its subjective judgment about the child's best interest for the parent's decision, thus depriving parents of their liberty and privacy interests in the care, custody, and management of their children. Accordingly, the trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional and awarded custody to the father. This Court granted the grandparents' application and consolidated their appeal with Clark v. Wade.</div><div class="casepar">II. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) governs custody disputes between a biological parent and a limited number of third parties who are related to the child. They include a grandparent, aunt or uncle, great aunt or uncle, sibling, or adoptive parent. The statute provides that a parent may lose custody if a trial court determines that the best interest of the child supports an award of custody to the third party. There is a presumption that it is in the child's best interest to remain in the custody of the parent, but the third party may rebut that presumption. The statute provides:</div><div class="casepar">Enacted in 1996, this statute adopts the same standard -- best interest of the child -- for custody disputes between a parent and third party as applies in custody disputes between two parents <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> or third parties. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> The primary difference is that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) establishes a rebuttable presumption that parental custody is always in the child's best interest, thus favoring the biological parent over the third party.</div><div class="casepar">Parental Rights and Fitness Standards</div><div class="casepar">In construing statutes, we must consider the legislative intent, keeping in mind "the old law, the evil, and the remedy." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> Under prior case law, the biological parent had a prima facie right to custody in an initial contest with any third party, including grandparents, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> stepparents, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> and adopting parents. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> A third party who sought custody had to show that (1) the parent had lost his or her parental power or (2) the parent was unfit. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Under the parental rights standard, a third party could gain custody in a dispute with a parent only by proving by clear and convincing evidence that the parent had lost his or her parental power. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> A parent could lose parental power in one of these ways: voluntary contract, consent to adoption, failure to provide necessaries or abandonment, consent to the child's receiving the proceeds of his labor, consent to the child's marriage, cruel treatment, or rearing the child under immoral influences. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Strict adherence to the parental rights standard sometimes resulted in unjust decisions that ignored the health and welfare of the child. For example, this Court reversed an award of custody to a stepfather with whom the child had lived and ruled instead that the biological father was entitled to custody after the mother's death, despite his having provided no financial support or sought any visitation with his daughter in the seven years since his divorce from the mother. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> Our decision was based in part on the well-settled legal principle that a parent's failure to support a minor child was not "a failure to provide necessaries or such abandonment as will amount to a relinquishment of the right of the parent to parental custody and control" when the mother never sought support. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> As one commentator concluded after reviewing the cases on relinquishment of a child by voluntary contract, "[A]dherence to the parental rights doctrine has led child custody cases into the thickets of the technicalities of contract law and away from the more relevant question of what is best for the child." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Because of the harshness of the parental rights standard, this Court adopted a second standard by which a parent could lose custody in exceptional circumstances. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span> Under the fitness standard, the third party had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the biological parent was unfit. In deciding parental unfitness, the trial court had to restrict its inquiry to the parent's present fitness; it could not rely on evidence of the parent's past unfitness <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> or compare the parent's ability to raise the child with the superior fitness of a third person. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Although this standard appears fair on its face, its application has caused unfair results because of its reliance on biological connections to the exclusion of other important considerations. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span> The fitness standard does not consider the absence of a custodial relationship between parent and child, the parent's conduct in causing any separation, the emotional bond that the child has developed with the third party due to their day-to-day relationship, or the age, maturity, and special needs of the child. Rather, it automatically vests custody in a biological parent, unless the parent is unfit, to the exclusion of the other relatives who have performed the parental role of nurturing and caring for the child. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Best Interest Standard</div><div class="casepar">In enacting OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1), the legislature changed the law governing parent-third party custody disputes and added an additional way by which parental power could be lost. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span> The Georgia General Assembly intended to replace the parental unfitness standard with the best-interest-of-the-child standard. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source26" href="#note26">26</a></span> Adoption of this new standard shifts the trial court's inquiry solely from the current fitness of the biological parent to raise the child to include consideration of the child's interest in a safe, secure environment that promotes his or her physical, mental, and emotional development. In considering what is in the best interest of the child, the trial court may consider the child's historical relationship with the parent, the child's relationship with the third-party custodian, and the child's special medical, emotional, or educational needs.</div><div class="casepar">What has not changed under the new standard are three presumptions: (1) the parent is a fit person entitled to custody, (2) a fit parent acts in the best interest of his or her child, and (3) the child's best interest is to be in the custody of a parent.</div><div class="casepar">III. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF BEST INTEREST STANDARD</div><div class="casepar">In considering the constitutionality of the Georgia statute on parent-third party custody disputes, there are two relevant lines of cases. One involves the termination of parental rights, which have usually required a showing of parental unfitness before ending the parent-child relationship. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source27" href="#note27">27</a></span> The other involves third-party visitation rights, which have historically considered the best interests of the child.</div><div class="casepar">Termination of Parental Rights</div><div class="casepar">The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The United States Supreme Court has recognized that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source28" href="#note28">28</a></span> Based on this liberty interest, the Court has concluded that parents have the right to establish a home, direct the upbringing of their children, and control their children's education, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source29" href="#note29">29</a></span> and the state may not sever the rights of parents in their natural child in a neglect proceeding unless it proves by clear and convincing evidence that the parents are unfit to raise their children. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source30" href="#note30">30</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In cases dealing with the rights of unwed fathers, however, the Court refused to adopt unfitness as the sole standard for enforcing a biological father's due process rights, instead distinguishing between a developed parent-child relationship and a potential relationship. For example, the Court in Stanley v. Illinois <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source31" href="#note31">31</a></span> held that an unwed father who had lived with his children and supported them all their lives was entitled to a hearing in a dependency proceeding on his fitness as a parent before the state could take away his children. In contrast, in Lehr v. Robertson, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source32" href="#note32">32</a></span> where the putative father had assumed no parental responsibility, the Court concluded that his biological link did not merit the same protection as the father's significant custodial, personal, and financial relationship with his children in Stanley. " '(The) importance of the familial relationship . . . stems from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, and from the role it plays in "(promoting) a way of life" through the instruction of children . . . as well as from the fact of blood relationship.' " <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source33" href="#note33">33</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In Quilloin v. Walcott, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source34" href="#note34">34</a></span> a case arising out of this state, the Supreme Court rejected the unwed father's contention that he was entitled to an absolute veto over the adoption of his child absent a finding of his unfitness. Instead, the Court concluded that the unwed father's substantive due process rights were not violated by rejecting his petition to legitimate the child and finding that the stepfather's adoption was in the child's best interest. The Court noted that the case did not involve the breakup of a "natural family," a biological father who had ever sought custody of his child, or the placement of the child with a new set of parents. "Rather, the result of the adoption in this case is to give full recognition to a family unit already in existence." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source35" href="#note35">35</a></span>Thus, even when the parental bond is to be severed, the United States Constitution permits courts to use a "best interests" standard.</div><div class="casepar">Unlike the parental termination cases, third-party custody cases do not sever the relationship between parent and child. Instead, the parent retains significant rights, including the right to visitation and to obtain custody under changed circumstances. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source36" href="#note36">36</a></span> When parental rights are not severed, federal constitutional law does not require a showing that the parent is unfit before custody may be awarded to a third party. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source37" href="#note37">37</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Grandparent Visitation Cases</div><div class="casepar">In the second line of cases, this Court held in Brooks v. Parkerson that our state grandparents' visitation statute was unconstitutional under both the Georgia Constitution and United States Constitution because it failed to require a showing of harm before visitation could be ordered. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source38" href="#note38">38</a></span> Reviewing the parents' protected interest in raising their children against the state's interest in protecting a child, we concluded that "state interference with a parent's right to raise children is justifiable only where the state acts in its police power to protect the child's health or welfare, and where parental decisions in the area would result in harm to the child." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source39" href="#note39">39</a></span> As a result, the Georgia General Assembly amended the grandparent visitation statute to require a finding of harm to the health or welfare of the child before visitation is granted. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source40" href="#note40">40</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The Supreme Court's decision last term in Troxel v. Granville <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source41" href="#note41">41</a></span> raises the question whether we correctly interpreted federal constitutional law as requiring a showing of harm to the child before a state may intervene in the parent's right to raise his or her family. In Troxel, the Court declined to strike down the Washington state statute on grandparent visitation as facially invalid, instead holding it unconstitutional as applied. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source42" href="#note42">42</a></span> The plurality found that the Washington statute was "breathtakingly broad," allowing any person at any time to petition for visitation rights, and contained no requirement that the parent's decision about visitation was entitled to any deference or presumption of validity. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source43" href="#note43">43</a></span> Although the state supreme court had the opportunity to give the statute a more narrow interpretation, it had declined to do so. Reviewing the facts in the case, the Court found that the trial court failed to give any weight to the fit custodial parent's decision, established a presumption in favor of grandparent visitation that the parent had to disprove, and failed to give significant weight to the parent's offer of meaningful visitation to the grandparents. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source44" href="#note44">44</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Because the Court based its decision on the sweeping breadth of the statute and the trial court's application of the statute's unlimited power, it did not decide whether due process required all grandparent visitation statutes to include a showing of harm as a condition precedent to granting visitation. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source45" href="#note45">45</a></span> The Court's plurality decision expressed hesitancy in holding that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate due process as a per se matter, agreeing with Justice Kennedy that the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation depends on the manner in which the standard is applied. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source46" href="#note46">46</a></span> In his dissent, Justice Kennedy notes that every state, except Georgia, employs the best-interest-of-the-child standard and establishes a variety of ways to ensure that parental decisions are given respect. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source47" href="#note47">47</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Unlike the grandparent visitation cases, however, the custody cases in this appeal do not involve a third party seeking to intrude upon an established parent-child custodial relationship. Instead, they involve a biological parent seeking to gain custody from a third party who has been responsible for the daily care of the child and already has established a family unit for the child. Thus, the relationship among the parent, child, and third-party relative differs in these custody cases from the relationship among the parties in Troxel and other grandparent visitation cases. Applying the Court's distinction in the unwed father cases, more than a biological link exists between the child and noncustodial father, but the relationship does not rise to the level of a daily association. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source48" href="#note48">48</a></span></div><div class="casepar">IV.

Second, the statute defers to the fit parent's decision on custody by establishing a rebuttable presumption in favor of parental custody.

CONCLUSION</div><div class="casepar">In conclusion, we interpret the best interest standard in the parent-third party custody statute to mean that the third party must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer physical or emotional harm if custody were awarded to the biological parent. Once this showing is made, the third party must then show that an award of custody to him or her will best promote the child's welfare and happiness. With that construction of the statute, we uphold the best-interest-of-the-child standard as constitutional when applied to custody disputes between a noncustodial parent and third party under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source65" href="#note65">65</a></span></div><div class="casepar">SEARS, Justice, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">I concur in the judgment of the majority opinion, and applaud the majority for resolving a difficult issue that this Court and our State legislature have struggled with for many years.</div><div class="casepar">In reaching its decision, however, the majority, in dicta, unnecessarily criticizes our holding in Brooks v. Patterson <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source66" href="#note66">66</a></span> that both the Georgia Constitution and the United States Constitution require a finding of harm to a child before grandparent visitation can be ordered. I disagree with this criticism, and emphasize that, despite the majority's criticism of Brooks, the majority ultimately reaffirms the principles of Brooks by holding that disputes between parents and third parties concerning the custody of the parents' children must be resolved using the rigorous harm standard adopted in Brooks.</div><div class="casepar">I also write to highlight the fact that the present disputes are between parents who have not cared for their children for a significant period of time and relatives who have stepped forward to do so. In these "reunification" cases, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source67" href="#note67">67</a></span> the day-to-day bond of the parent-child relationship already has been interrupted, and the child may have formed strong and lasting relationships with the person who has been caring for him. I believe that, for these cases, the majority opinion properly recognizes a preference for the reunification of the parent and child, but permits a third party to prevent that reunification if the third party can meet the stringent harm standard set forth in the majority opinion.</div><div class="casepar">It is critical to distinguish these "reunification" cases from cases in which a third party seeks to break apart an intact parent-child relationship by seeking custody of the parents' child. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source68" href="#note68">68</a></span> When a third party seeks to remove a child from the care of his or her parents, an even more stringent standard than that applied in the present case is necessary for the removal to be constitutional. In such "removal" cases, only the traditional parental fitness test can be constitutionally applied, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source69" href="#note69">69</a></span> resulting in the removal of the children only when the parents "are incapable of taking adequate care of their children." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source70" href="#note70">70</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Finally, I take issue with the assertion in Justice Hunstein's special concurrence that the changing face of the American family justifies the application of a best-interest-of-the-child standard when a third party seeks to obtain custody of a parent's child. To the contrary, I find that the lamentable decline in the traditional family supports the harm standard adopted in the majority opinion. The best interest standard would erect unnecessary barriers to the reunification of a parent and child in appropriate cases by permitting a third party to retain custody of a child simply because the third party may be better able to provide for the child's future and education. The best interest standard thus would facilitate the decline of the traditional parent-child family. On the other hand, the harm standard would stem the decline of the nuclear family by fostering the reunification of parent and child. That standard, however, also grants trial courts the flexibility to permit third parties to retain custody when physical or emotional harm would result to the child if custody were changed.</div><div class="casepar">For the foregoing reasons, I concur specially in the majority opinion.</div><div class="casepar">HUNSTEIN, Justice, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">We are called upon in these appeals to determine whether the application of the best interest of the child standard in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1), the Georgia statute governing custody disputes between parents and certain third parties, violates the constitutional rights of competent parents to raise their children without undue interference by the State. I concur in the majority's decision that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) is constitutional but write separately because I reject the majority's finding that in order to save the statute from constitutional challenge we must engraft onto the best interest of the child standard a categorical rule that authorized third parties who seek custody of a child must always first demonstrate that parental custody would harm the child. This precondition is not constitutionally required because the statute, as written and intended to be applied by the General Assembly, properly balances the competing constitutional interests of parents, children and the State.</div><div class="casepar">While I agree with the majority that parents' interests in raising their children without undue interference of the State is one of the oldest and most fundamental of liberty interests, in my view the conclusion that a showing of harm is constitutionally required rests, in large part, upon the misplaced and often incorrect assumption that the parents have been the child's primary caregivers and that third parties who seek custody have no legitimate or established relationship with the child. In reality, many children today are being raised not by their parents but by other family members with a strong attachment to the child and who have lovingly and responsibly acted in the role of the child's parent. The relationships that form from such attachments, although not always biological, are of importance to both the child and society because they "derive from the intimacy of daily association, and from the role it plays in 'promot(ing) a way of life' through the instruction of children.

Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census Statistics, in 1996, 28 percent of children in the United States lived in single parent households, while in 1998 approximately 4 million children, 5.6 percent of all children under the age of 18, lived in the household of their grandparents. Troxel, supra, 120 SC at 2059 (II). See also id., 120 SC at 2077-2078 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (conventional nuclear family is no longer the structure or prevailing condition in many households). Due, at least in part, to the changing face of the American family, most states, including Georgia, have attempted to protect the welfare of the children and the relationships they have formed with family and de facto parents by enacting nonparental visitation and custody statutes. These statutes are further supported by the recognition of the State's interest in protecting the welfare of its children as parens patriae as well as the interests of the child in protecting established familial or family-like bonds. See Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (64 SC 438, 88 LE 645) (1944); Troxel, supra, 120 SC at 2071-2072 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (child has "extremely likely" liberty interest in preserving established familial or family-like bonds); Blackburn v.

Although in Brooks, supra, a majority of this Court found unconstitutional Georgia's grandparent visitation statute because it failed to require a showing of harm before visitation could be ordered, I agree with the majority's suggestion in these appeals that the holding of Troxel calls into question the continued validity of the Brooks opinion to the extent it was decided on Federal constitutional grounds. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source71" href="#note71">71</a></span> Moreover, although Troxel addresses the issue of child visitation and not custody, I believe it is instructive and supports my conclusion that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1) as written is constitutionally valid.</div><div class="casepar">The United States Supreme Court in Troxel was confronted with the State of Washington's third party visitation statute which allowed any person to petition for visitation rights with a child at any time with the only requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest of the child. The Washington Supreme Court struck down the statute on Federal constitutional grounds because the statute required no threshold showing of harm and because it swept too broadly by allowing "any person" to petition for forced visitation under a best interest of the child standard. In a plurality opinion, four justices of the United States Supreme Court found the statute unconstitutional as applied because it infringed upon the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of their children. Troxel, supra, 120 SC at 2060. Of primary concern to the Court was the absence within the statute of a requirement that a court accord a parent's decision that visitation would not be in the child's best interest any deference or presumption of validity, thereby providing no protection to the parent's fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning his or her child.

See Stills, supra at 650 (applying best interest of child standard to custody dispute between non-parents). At the same time, it is constitutionally significant that the statute gives substantial weight to the parents' rights by including the presumption that it is in the best interest of the child for custody to be awarded to the parent, thereby preserving the presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of the child. Through the inclusion of such presumption in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/19/7/1/index.html">19-7-1</a></span> (b.1), together with the restriction on the third parties authorized to petition for custody, the General Assembly avoided the constitutional pitfalls in the Washington statute in Troxel.</div><div class="casepar">The precise scope of parental rights in the context of child custody must be carefully considered on a case by case basis. To focus solely on the interests of the parents, as does any standard mandating a showing of harm, ignores what may be the equally compelling interest of the child or the State in protecting the child's welfare and happiness. The facts of the two appeals before us illustrate the danger of requiring a showing of harm. The custody cases at issue do not involve a third party seeking to interfere with an established parent-child relationship but involve a biological parent seeking to gain custody of a child from grandparents who have been responsible for the daily care of the child and are now seeking to keep intact a family unit already in existence. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 255 (II) (A) (98 SC 549, 54 LE2d 511) (1978). In these circumstances, the interests of the State and the child in maintaining the stability of the only family unit the child has ever known must be accorded great weight and the biological parents' rights to the custody and control of their children must be examined in light of the fact that they have allowed third parties to raise the children for all or most of their lives. See generally Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248, 260 (103 SC 2985, 77 LE2d 614) (1983) (parents' interests " 'do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child.

That statute permitted a grandparent to seek visitation "upon proof of special circumstances which make such visitation rights necessary to the best interest of the child." In striking down the statute, this Court concluded that grandparent visitation does not clearly promote the health and welfare of a child, and that even if it did, the statute did not require "a showing of harm before state interference is authorized."

Because it intended "to move Georgia law away from a strict 'parental priority rights' standard and toward an examination of the best interest of the child when custody is at issue." 13 Ga. State Univ. L. Rev. ("Peach Sheet"), pp. 155, 157. In other words, the legislature concluded that, while Brooks required a showing of harm in a grandparent visitation case, such a showing was not necessary in a child custody case. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source72" href="#note72">72</a></span></div><div class="casepar">My approach would be in accord with many jurisdictions which have considered this issue. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source73" href="#note73">73</a></span> And it is sound.

      See Carolyn Wilkes Kaas, Breaking Up a Family or Putting It Back Together Again: Refining the Preference in Favor of the Parent in Third-Party Custody Cases, 37 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1045, 1058-1059 (1996). In her article, Wilkes uses the term "reunification" to describe cases such as these, and the term "removal" to describe cases in which there is an on-going parent-child relationship, and a third party seeks to break that bond by seeking custody of the children.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note68" href="#source68">68</a></span>&nbsp;

      In Troxel, the Court noted that each of the 50 states has adopted some version of a third party visitation statute and that every state, except Georgia, permits a court to require third party visitation in certain cases if it is found to be in the best interests of the child. See Troxel, supra, 120 SC at 2078 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The plurality declined to address the question of whether the Constitution requires such statutes to include, as a condition</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note72" href="#source72">72</a></span>&nbsp;
      The last sentence of subsection (b.1) makes this point plainly it reads: The sole issue for determination in any such case shall be what is in the best interest of the child or children.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note73" href="#source73">73</a></span>&nbsp;
      See, e.g., Ex Parte Terry, 494 S2d 628 (Ala. 1986) (parent has prima facie right to child custody absent showing of a forfeiture of parental rights or a finding of unfitness); Langerman v. Langerman, 321 NW2d 532 (S.D. 1982) (granting child custody to one other than a parent requires a showing of gross parental misconduct, unfitness, or extraordinary circumstances affecting child welfare); Sheppard v. Sheppard, 630 P2d 1121 (Kan. 1981) (statute which authorizes award of custody to third persons without a finding that parents are unfit is unconstitutional); In the Matter of Dickson v. Lascaris, 53 NY2d 204 (423 NE2d 361) (N.Y. 1981) (child custody by a parent may not be displaced in the absence of abandonment, unfitness or other like extraordinary circumstances); Henderson v. Henderson, 568 P2d 177 (Mont. 1977) (where third party seeks custody right, parent prevails unless the child has been neglected or abused); Chandler v. Chandler, 535 SW2d 71 (Ky. Ct. App. 1975) (custody cannot be awarded to grandparent unless it is determined that child's welfare would be better served). In fact, at least 38 states have adopted this "parental preference" principle. Stuhr v. Stuhr, 481 NW2d 212, 216 (Neb. 1992).</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Kutner &amp; Bloom, Jean M. Kutner, David A.
