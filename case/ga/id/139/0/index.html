Spalding Superior Court. Before Judge Whalen.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">A jury found Willie James Pye guilty of malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, rape, armed robbery, and burglary. For the murder, the jury recommended a death sentence, finding as four separate statutory aggravating circumstances that Pye had committed that crime while engaged in the commission of the offenses of kidnapping with bodily injury, rape, armed robbery, and burglary. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (2). Pye's motion for new trial was denied and he appeals. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Jury Selection</div><div class="casepar">1. Pye contends that the State violated Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (106 SC 1712, 90 LE2d 69) (1986) by using four peremptory strikes against black prospective jurors. The record shows that the State gave reasons for these four peremptory strikes, rendering the necessity of a preliminary showing of prima facie discrimination moot. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 359 (111 SC 1859, 114 LE2d 395) (1991); Lewis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/0/index.html">262 Ga. 679</a></span>, 680 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/0/index.html">424 SE2d 626</a></span>) (1993). After a hearing, the trial court ruled that Pye did not meet his burden of showing that the State had acted with discriminatory intent. This ruling will be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous. Turner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/8/index.html">267 Ga. 149</a></span>, 151 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/8/index.html">476 SE2d 252</a></span>) (1996).</div><div class="casepar">In one instance, the State exercised a peremptory strike because inquiries in the community led the prosecutor to believe that the prospective juror was argumentative and might prevent the return of a unanimous verdict. The State "may rely on information and advice provided by others so long as this input is not predicated upon the race of the prospective juror." Barnes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../126/1/index.html">269 Ga. 345</a></span>, 350 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../126/1/index.html">496 SE2d 674</a></span>) (1998). See also Lewis v. State, supra at 681 (2). The trial court did not err by accepting the State's reason for the strike of this juror, because there was no discriminatory intent inherent in the State's explanation and it was not so implausible as to render the explanation pretextual. See Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765 (115 SC 1769, 131 LE2d 834) (1995); Jackson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../255/7/index.html">265 Ga. 897</a></span>, 898 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../255/7/index.html">463 SE2d 699</a></span>) (1995).</div><div class="casepar">The prosecutor struck another prospective juror who testified that she was conscientiously opposed to the death penalty and believed that life without parole was a greater deterrent than a death sentence. The prosecutor also stated that his assistant had known this juror for years and believed that she would be unable to vote for imposition of the death penalty. These were valid race-neutral reasons sufficient to justify a peremptory strike. See Tharpe v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/3/index.html">262 Ga. 110</a></span>, 112 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/3/index.html">416 SE2d 78</a></span>) (1992); Barnes v. State, supra. Pye complains that the State did not strike white prospective jurors who testified that they believed that life without parole was a greater deterrent than death. The record reveals, however, that these white jurors did not state, as this prospective juror did, that they were also conscientiously opposed to the death penalty.</div><div class="casepar">The prosecutor struck a third prospective juror because she testified that she was conscientiously opposed to the death penalty, even though she later said that she could vote for a death sentence. As previously stated, this is a valid race-neutral reason sufficient to justify a peremptory strike. Tharpe v. State, supra. The prosecutor further stated that this prospective juror's son was a public defender in Atlanta. This reason is also sufficient to justify a peremptory' strike, because the explanation was neither inherently discriminatory nor implausibly pretextual. See Purkett v. Elem, supra; Jackson v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">The State struck the fourth prospective juror because he seemed confused by the voir dire questions and repeatedly contradicted him-self about his opinion on the deterrent value of a death sentence, his impartiality, and whether he was conscientiously opposed to the death penalty. This explanation is supported by the voir dire transcript and is a valid race-neutral reason. See Purkett v. Elem, supra; Jackson v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">In none of the four instances was the trial court's Batson ruling clearly erroneous. Accordingly, this enumeration of error is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. Pye complains that the trial court failed to ask prospective jurors on voir dire whether they would consider mitigating circumstances or would automatically impose a death sentence if Pye was convicted of murder. Because Pye did not request the trial court to ask these questions, he cannot now complain. Durham v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../101/58/index.html">239 Ga. 697</a></span>, 699 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../101/58/index.html">238 SE2d 334</a></span>) (1977); Eberheart v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../121/59/index.html">232 Ga. 247</a></span>, 251 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../121/59/index.html">206 SE2d 12</a></span>) (1974), vacated in part on other grounds, Coker v. State, 433 U. S. 584 (97 SC 2861, 53 LE2d 982) (1977). Moreover, Pye could have asked the questions himself and, in fact, did so in some instances. Therefore, any error was harmless. Robinson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../103/58/index.html">238 Ga. 291</a></span>, 292 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../103/58/index.html">232 SE2d 561</a></span>) (1977).</div><div class="casepar">3. Pye urges that the trial court conducted an inadequate investigation into the possible misconduct of alternate juror Alvin Yarbrough. The record shows that, after the jury was seated, two jurors informed the trial court that, on the first day of voir dire, Yarbrough had commented that he was the victim's cousin. The trial court then questioned Yarbrough, who responded that, when he heard the victim's name announced, he said that he was the victim's cousin only because they had the same last name. Yarbrough stated that he was not related to the victim and did not know her. The trial court allowed Yarbrough to remain an alternate juror, and informed the two concerned jurors that it had ascertained that Yarbrough was not related to the victim. Pye did not object to the investigation conducted by the trial court or request further investigation. Bowens v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../288/50/index.html">217 Ga. App. 283 (457 SE2d 238) (1995)</a></span>. Moreover, any error was harmless because Yarbrough was not needed to replace any regular jurors and, therefore, did not participate in deliberations or influence the verdict. State v. Newsome, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../430/0/index.html">259 Ga. 187</a></span>, 188 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../430/0/index.html">378 SE2d 125</a></span>) (1989).</div><div class="casepar">The Guilt-Innocence Phase of Trial</div><div class="casepar">4. The evidence presented at trial authorized the jury to find the following: Pye had been in a sporadic romantic relationship with the victim, Alicia Lynn Yarbrough, but, at the time of her murder, Ms. Yarbrough was living with another man, Charles Puckett. Pye and two companions, Chester Adams and Anthony Freeman, planned to rob Puckett because Pye had heard that Puckett had just collected money from the settlement of a lawsuit. Pye was also angry because Puckett had signed the birth certificate of a child whom Pye claimed as his own.</div><div class="casepar">The three men drove to Griffin in Adams' car and, in a street transaction, Pye bought a large, distinctive .22 pistol. They then went to a party where a witness observed Pye in possession of the large .22. Just before midnight, the three left the party and drove toward Puckett's house. As they were leaving, a witness heard Pye say, "it's time, let's do it." All of the men put on the ski masks which Pye had brought with him, and Pye and Adams also put on gloves.</div><div class="casepar">They approached Puckett's house on foot and observed that only Ms. Yarbrough and her baby were home. Pye tried to open a window and Ms. Yarbrough saw him and screamed. Pye ran around to the front door, kicked it in, and held Ms. Yarbrough at gunpoint. After determining that there was no money in the house, they took a ring and a necklace from Ms. Yarbrough and abducted her, leaving the infant in the house. The men drove to a nearby motel where Pye rented a room using an alias. In the motel room, the three men took turns raping Ms. Yarbrough at gunpoint. Pye was angry with Ms. Yarbrough and said, "You let Puckett sign my baby's birth certificate."</div><div class="casepar">After attempting to eliminate their fingerprints from the motel room, the three men and Ms. Yarbrough left in Adams' car. Pye whispered in Adams' ear and Adams turned off onto a dirt road. Pye then ordered Ms. Yarbrough out of the car, made her lie face down, and shot her three times, killing her. As they were driving away, Pye tossed the gloves, masks, and the large .22 from the car. The police later recovered these items and found the victim's body only a few hours after she was killed. A hair found on one of the masks was consistent with the victim's hair, and a ballistics expert determined that there was a 90 percent probability that a bullet found in the victim's body had been fired by the .22. Semen was found in the victim's body and DNA taken from the semen matched Pye's DNA. When Pye talked to the police later that day, he stated that he had not seen the victim in at least two weeks. However, Freeman confessed and later testified for the State.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find proof of Pye's guilt of malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, armed robbery, rape, and burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). The evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find that Pye's commission of kidnapping with bodily injury, armed robbery, rape, and burglary were aggravating circumstances which supported his death sentence for the murder.</div><div class="casepar">5. Freeman's inculpatory testimony was corroborated by other evidence that Pye was seen with the murder weapon shortly before the victim was killed, that Pye lied to the police when first questioned about the victim's death, and that Pye had previously threatened the victim's life. This evidence was sufficient to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice as required by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/4/8/index.html">24-4-8</a></span>. Castell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/7/index.html">250 Ga. 776</a></span>, 780 (1) (c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/7/index.html">301 SE2d 234</a></span>) (1983).</div><div class="casepar">6. The deputy who first discovered the victim's body testified that she recognized the victim. Pye asked the deputy how she knew the victim, but the State objected that Pye was attempting to introduce the victim's irrelevant cocaine use. The trial court twice ruled that Pye could not introduce evidence of the victim's cocaine habit until he had shown it to be relevant. When the trial court made these rulings, there had been no evidence that the victim's use of drugs played any part in her death. Later, however, Pye testified that he rented the motel room to sell drugs, that Adams and Freeman showed up with the victim, and that the victim willingly traded sex for crack cocaine and left with Adams and Freeman. Pye contends that the trial court erroneously refused to allow him to corroborate his subsequent testimony by presenting evidence of the victim's cocaine habit and of her willingness to trade sex for cocaine.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not preclude all inquiry by Pye concerning the victim's cocaine habit. Compare Hines v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../703/3/index.html">249 Ga. 257</a></span>, 260 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../703/3/index.html">290 SE2d 911</a></span>) (1982). It merely limited cross-examination into that topic until Pye had shown its relevance. See Cofield v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../757/8/index.html">247 Ga. 98</a></span>, 111 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../757/8/index.html">274 SE2d 530</a></span>) (1981); Crawford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../512/55/index.html">154 Ga. App. 362</a></span>, 363 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../512/55/index.html">268 SE2d 414</a></span>) (1980). Indeed, the trial court specifically told Pye that he could pursue the subject of the victim's cocaine habit and willingness to trade sex for cocaine if there was evidence that cocaine was in her system when she died, or if Pye testified about an exchange of sex for drugs. After Pye's testimony, however, he made no further attempt to develop any evidence in this regard. Since the trial court did not deprive Pye of the opportunity to establish his version of the events, we find no error. Goodwin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../318/21/index.html">208 Ga. App. 707 (1) (431 SE2d 473) (1993)</a></span>; Harris v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../357/18/index.html">196 Ga. App. 304</a></span>, 306 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../357/18/index.html">396 SE2d 288</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">7. Pye also contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of two prior incidents in which he threatened the victim. The trial court ruled that the two incidents were admissible to show motive. Pye argues that these incidents involving threats against the victim were irrelevant and prejudicial, since the State's theory at trial involved Pye's anger with Puckett for signing a birth certificate and Pye's attempt to rob Puckett.</div><div class="casepar">[E]vidence of the defendant's prior acts toward the victim, be it a prior assault, a quarrel, or a threat, is admissible when the defendant is accused of a criminal act against the victim, as the prior acts are evidence of the relationship between the victim and the defendant and may show the defendant's motive, intent, and bent of mind in committing the act against the victim which results in the charges for which the defendant is being prosecuted.</div><div class="casepar">Wall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../131/3/index.html">269 Ga. 506</a></span>, 509 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../131/3/index.html">500 SE2d 904</a></span>) (1998). There is no longer any requirement for the State to provide pretrial notice to the defendant of its intent to proffer such evidence of prior difficulties between the defendant and the victim or for the trial court to make the analysis formerly required by Maxwell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/5/index.html">262 Ga. 73 (2) (414 SE2d 470) (1992)</a></span>. Wall v. State, supra at 507 (2). That Pye previously threatened the victim with a handgun and threatened to kill her if she began a relationship with another man was probative evidence of their relationship and of Pye's motive and bent of mind. The State's theory of revenge and attempted robbery against Puckett explains Pye's assault on the Puckett house, but does not foreclose the admission of additional evidence to explain Pye's subsequent violence against the victim.</div><div class="casepar">8. Pye urges that the State impermissibly introduced evidence of a polygraph test to bolster Puckett's testimony. On direct examination, Puckett volunteered that the police gave him a lie detector test. The State did not seek to elaborate, and Pye did not object. The State's subsequent passing reference to the fact that Puckett had testified that he was given a polygraph test again prompted no objection from Pye. Thus, Pye waived his right to enumerate error on appeal by failing to object to any mention of the lie detector test at trial. Fargason v.

Pye contends that the State twice impermissibly placed his character into evidence. In one instance, Puckett testified on cross-examination that Pye was in jail when Puckett's baby was conceived. Defense counsel did not object, move to strike the testimony, or request curative instructions. Therefore, we will not consider this instance of alleged impermissible placement of Pye's character into evidence. Houston v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../413/50/index.html">180 Ga.

When the State asserted that Pye thereby placed his character into evidence, the trial court erroneously permitted the State to reopen its case and introduce Pye's prior convictions for burglary and entering an automobile.

However, the trial court later recognized its error and, at length, instructed the jury to disregard Pye's prior convictions. Pye did not object to these curative instructions, request additional instructions, or move for a mistrial thereafter. Thus, this issue has not been preserved for appellate review. Weems v.

Pye claims that the State used information never introduced into evidence to obtain his conviction, and that he was therefore unable to confront all the evidence against him. The State's fiber expert testified about fibers from Pye's clothes that were consistent with fibers found on other articles of clothing. The State did not introduce all of the articles of clothing into evidence at trial, but all of the clothing was available to Pye for cross-examination and inspection. At the conclusion of the fiber expert's testimony, the State asked the trial court if the expert could take the clothing back with him to the lab because the State needed it for Adams' upcoming murder trial. The trial court agreed after Pye's counsel stated that he had no objection to the expert taking the clothing with him. Therefore, Pye waived any objection to the absence of a formal introduction into evidence of all of the actual clothing. See Spencer v.

Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (96 SC 2240, 49 LE2d 91) (1976). Doyle holds that, after a defendant has received Miranda warnings, the State's use of his silence to impeach him violates due process. Lee v.

Pye further contends that the State's attorney "testified" by asking two improper, prejudicial questions on cross-examination.

Pye also contends that the prosecutor made improper closing arguments. Counsel for the State commented on future dangerousness by arguing that Pye would kill a prison guard in order to escape.

That Pye could harm a prison guard is a reasonable inference, considering that he had been convicted of several violent crimes, including murder.</div><div class="casepar">The prosecutor also argued that Pye was sorry that he did not kill Freeman so that Freeman could not "put the finger on him," and that, if Pye's lawyer had been present on the night of the murder and had tried to talk Pye out of killing the victim, "the only difference that it would have made is that there would have been two bodies instead of one," defense counsel's and the victim's. The thrust of this argument was that Pye showed no mercy during the murder, but was intent on killing the victim, and that he showed no remorse, but was sorry only that he had left an eyewitness alive. It is not improper to argue a defendant's lack of remorse or his failure to show the victim mercy. See Carr v.

Although the State used violent imagery, it did not exceed its considerable latitude in illustrating its argument. See Philmore v. State, supra.

State, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> this Court held that the prosecutor's statement that Conner was the first defendant against whom he had sought the death penalty was improper because it was not based on facts in evidence. Similarly, this Court stated in Horton v. State <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> that, even though it was common knowledge that the death penalty had seldom been imposed in recent years, the prosecutor should not have referred to this fact since it was not in evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The prosecutor's argument that Pye would kill a prison guard was not a reasonable inference from any evidence in the record. Although the state claims in its brief that such statements are supported by the record, the state has failed to provide a single citation to the record.

This case is unlike Spencer v.

In that case, the facts showed that Spencer had committed the murder for which he was on trial in an attempt to escape from law-enforcement officers.</div><div class="casepar">The majority's ruling will have dramatic impact not just on arguments, but also on evidence in the sentencing phase. In Skipper v. South Carolina, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> the United States Supreme Court unanimously agreed that where the prosecution relies on the defendant's future dangerousness to argue for the imposition of the death penalty, elemental due process requires that the defendant be offered an opportunity to introduce evidence on this point. Therefore, if the state is permitted to speculate wildly in closing argument about the defendant's threat to prison guards, the defendant is constitutionally entitled to reopen the evidence to rebut this argument. Thus, sentencing trials will now routinely include witnesses to testify about the defendant's current behavior in prison, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> expert witnesses to testify about the defendant's probable behavior in prison, and corrections personnel to testify about security in prisons holding inmates serving sentences of life or life without parole. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Thus, this opinion will further the expenditure of time, resources, and testimony on issues not related directly to the particular defendant, the crime committed, or the appropriate punishment for that crime.</div><div class="casepar">I further disagree with the conclusion that the statements that Pye wished he had killed Freeman and would have killed his own lawyer are reasonable inferences from the record. The state has pointed to no evidence in the record of any threats Pye made against Freeman or Pye's lawyer. Additionally, the majority's reliance on Philmore v.
