J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Roy Rivers was the beneficiary named in a policy of insurance in the Provident Indemnity Life Insurance Company. Upon the death of Louise (Douglas) Seldon, the insured, the plaintiff's sister, he brought suit for the amount for which her life had been insured, the statutory penalty for the insurance company's refusal to make payment, and attorney's fees. The insurance company defended upon the ground that at the time of the death of the insured the policy sued on had been and was lapsed by its own terms. The insurance contract and the premium receipt book were introduced in evidence. The contract contains, among others, the following provisions: "Limitation of Agents' Authority--No agent or person shall have authority to receive any premium, payment of which is tendered more than four weeks following the last payment of premium. Period of Grace--A grace period of four weeks (twenty-eight days) shall be granted for the payment of every premium after the first, during which time this policy shall continue in force. If the weekly premiums are due and unpaid for twenty-eight days, this policy becomes lapsed automatically at the close of business on Monday, the twenty-eighth day, and the company's liability shall cease except as provided herein . . . Alterations, Modifications and Waivers--No modification, change or alteration hereof or endorsement hereon shall be valid unless signed by the president or secretary of the company, and no other person is authorized on behalf of the company to make, alter or discharge this contract. Agents (which term includes all field representatives) are not authorized to waive any of the provisions, conditions or privileges of this policy, or to bind the company by making any promises not contained in this policy, or to extend the term of payment of premiums or other moneys due the company . . . Reinstatement--If this policy shall lapse for non-payment of premiums . . . it may be reinstated within one year from the date to which premiums have been duly paid, upon receipt by the company, at its principal office, of written application for reinstatement, together with evidence of insurability satisfactory to the company, and upon payment of all overdue premiums, and payment or reinstatement of any indebtedness hereon or secured hereby." It appears that the effective date of the policy was February 28, 1949, and that payment of premiums in advance began on that date. The premium receipt book, showing the date when premiums were due and when they were paid, appears as follows: </div><div class="casepar">due 1949 Day Month Year Received of Agent Mar. 7 7 3 49 1.96 R C </div><div class="casepar">" 21 21 3 49 2.66 Perkins Apr. 4 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 </div><div class="casepar">" 18 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 May 2 14 5 49 2.66 Perkins </div><div class="casepar">" 16 11 7 49 2.66 2.66 " 30 ---- ---- ---- 2.66</div><div class="casepar">" 13 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 " 27 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 Chupp </div><div class="casepar">" 11 30 7 49 2.66 Chupp " 25 27 8 49 2.66 Chupp </div><div class="casepar">" 8 ---- ---- ---" 22 ---- ---- ---- </div><div class="casepar">Sept. 5 ---- ---- ---" 19 ---- ---- ---- Receipts N.L. </div><div class="casepar">App.] JANUARY TERM, 1951. 343 due 1949 Day Month Year Received of Agent </div><div class="casepar">Oct. 3 " 17 12 11 49 2.66 Perkins </div><div class="casepar">" 31 12 12 ---- 2.66 " 14 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 13.30 </div><div class="casepar">" 28 ---- ---- ---- 2.66 J.

N. L.," "Rc N L," or "Receipts N. L." appeared that meant "Receipts not lifted," and by receipts not lifted was meant that the premium due was paid on the date due but that the premium book was not on hand for the agent to enter the payment so that a receipt was given and at a later date the payment was entered in the book. This same agent testified that he received the payment made by the plaintiff on December 12, 1949, and entered the payments on the premium receipt book for the weeks beginning on October 31 and ending on November 28, but that the policy had lapsed on November 28 and that it was necessary to have the policy reinstated, in accordance with the terms of the contract, before the beneficiary would have been entitled to recover and that no reinstatement was or could have been made as the insured died on December 13. He also explained that his acceptance of the premiums did not revive the policy, as these premiums were placed in a special account and held in trust for the insured and were either to be returned to the insured if the policy was not reinstated or applied on the policy in the event the policy was reinstated; that he would not have issued a new contract of insurance but that upon reinstatement the insured would continue under the old contract of insurance.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff testified that he made the payments on December 12, 1949, and that he realized that at that time the payments on the policy were still two weeks in arrears, but that nothing was said to him about reinstatement or about the insured's condition. He also stated that demand for payment of the insurance due was made upon the defendant by letter from the under taker and that he signed this letter.</div><div class="casepar">Upon motion the court directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff moved for a new trial. His motion was overruled and he excepted.</div><div class="casepar">The single question presented for determination is whether the court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant, and from a consideration of the evidence which has been set forth in the foregoing statement of fact, we think that it did. Under the terms of the contract of insurance premiums were payable in advance each Monday. A period of twenty-eight days of grace was allowed on each payment, but failure to make payment of a premium due after the expiration of the grace period automatically effected a lapse of the policy and it was necessary to have the policy formally reinstated. From an examination of the premium receipt book it appears that the last payment made was on December 12, 1949, and that the insured's last payment prior to that time had been made on November 19, 1949 and applied against the premium due on October 24, 1949. It appears, therefore, that at the time the payment was made on December 12, 1949, payments were due for October 31, November 7, 14, 21, 28, December 5, and 12. The payment made on December 12 was $13.30 and if applied to premiums due would have paid the policy up through the week of Monday, November 28, leaving two weeks still past due, but which could have been paid, under the terms of the contract, at any time within twenty-eight days from the dates due.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff contends that if the defendant's contention were true, then its agent should have informed the plaintiff (who made the payment on December 12) that the policy had lapsed, and the agent should have refused to accept the payment and should not have applied this payment, in the premium receipt book, against five of the past-due premiums; and that by the action of its agent, the defendant waived the strict terms of the contract of insurance requiring a formal reinstatement of the policy in the event it became lapsed.</div><div class="casepar">While the defendant's agent testified that upon no occasion had the terms of the contract ever been waived, an examination of the entries in the premium receipt book, which we presume to be true, reveals that the premium due on May 9 was not paid until July 4, a period of seven weeks after it was due, the premium due on May 16 was not paid until July 11, seven weeks after due, and the payment due on July 25 was not paid until August 27, a period of four weeks and three days after due. There is nothing marked on the premium receipt book to indicate that these payments were made on the date due and later entered on the book under the "receipt-not-lifted" practice of the defendant. There is no evidence that the policy had ever lapsed or had been formally reinstated since its inception to the time it is claimed by the defendant that it had lapsed. Under this evidence, showing the defendant's course of dealing with the insured, the jury, under proper instructions from the court, would have been fully authorized to find that had the insured not died, the deferred payments which were in default at the time of the insured's death would have been accepted and applied against the premiums due without lapsing the policy and requiring formal reinstatement, and to infer that the defendant had by this course of dealing induced the belief on the part of the insured that she might pay the premiums after the expiration of the grace period in case she should live and continue to pay the premiums. And, having drawn such inferences, the jury would have been authorized to find that the payment made on December 12 was actually applied against the premiums past due, that the policy was, therefore, paid up through the week beginning Monday, November 28, and that although the insured died on December 13, with two weeks' premiums still due, her death occurred within a period of grace when the policy was still in force. It follows that the trial court erred in its failure to submit these questions to the jury, and in directing a verdict for the defendant. See Bankers Health &amp; Life Ins. Co. v.
