DeKalb State Court. Before Judge Mitchell.</div><div class="casepresiding">EBERHARDT, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">All evidence submitted in support of and in opposition to the motions for summary judgment reveals the lack of any right of recovery by the plaintiff against either the insurer or its agent beyond the terms of the policy currently in force when the loss occurred, which the insurer has offered to pay, hence it was error to deny the motions for summary judgment submitted by the defendants.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff purchased his various coverages of insurance through Parris &amp; Son, Inc., a local agent for United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company. A homeowner's policy was among them. It was issued on a three-year term, the premium being payable in advance annually with the coverage to be extended at the end of the first and second years if the premiums therefor were paid when due. Under Coverage C the coverage for theft of any one item of jewelry, watches, necklaces, bracelets, gems, precious and semi-precious stones, etc. and of any article or item of fur, was limited to $1,000.</div><div class="casepar">During the three-year term of the policy the company applied to the Insurance Commissioner for approval of a homeowner's policy form which further limited the coverage to $500 in the aggregate for losses by theft of jewelry, watches, necklaces, etc. and furs. Approval was granted and the company thereafter issued all homeowner's policies on the newly approved form.</div><div class="casepar">Upon expiration of the three-year term of the policy No. HOU1175643 March 17, 1970 the agent prepared for the plaintiff a new policy No. FIP464931, written on the newly approved form, effective March 17, 1970 to March 17, 1973, and sent it to him by mail. Plaintiff duly received the policy in a sealed envelope, put it away in a filing cabinet where his policies were kept, without opening the envelope or examining the policy.</div><div class="casepar">Some nine months later, in February, 1971, his home was burglarized and he suffered a loss of jewelry and furs which he valued at more than $3,000, as well as other items which were also covered by the policy terms. He made claim for his loss in the total amount of $6,063.70, and the company offered to pay $1,715.73, the amount being reduced because of the change in coverage occurring in the newly approved policy form upon which the current policy had been written.</div><div class="casepar">He brought suit in two counts against both the insurer and its agent, seeking recovery of his full loss, alleging in Count 1 that at no time had he been informed by them of the decrease in coverage, that he had relied upon them to provide coverage which would properly protect him, and that the reduction had been such a dereliction of duty as to constitute bad faith, for which he also sought damages and attorney fees.</div><div class="casepar">In Count 2 he alleged that all items lost in the burglary had been protected under coverage of his policy of insurance with defendants and that he was entitled to recover their full value. Copies of both policies were attached.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant admitted that it had issued the policies and delivered them to plaintiff, asserted that policy No. HOU1175643 had expired prior to plaintiff's loss and that it had offered to pay to the extent of the coverage provided in policy No. HP464931 which was in force and effect at the time of the loss, and asserted that if any false representations had been made concerning the coverage they had been made by the agent without authority to do so and were not binding on the defendant, that the policy No. HP464931 as written constitutes the whole contract between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff is entitled to no coverage beyond that provided in it.</div><div class="casepar">Depositions were taken. Plaintiff admitted that he had received the second policy about the time the first had, by its terms, expired, and that he had not opened the envelope in which it came to him, that he had not examined or read either policy until after the burglary occurred, and asserted that he had simply relied upon the agent to provide him with suitable coverage. After the loss he had communicated with the agent, who then told him that he was "fully covered," and that he "should not worry."</div><div class="casepar">The agent admitted that it had written policies for the plaintiff for several years, including the two referred to in the complaint, but denied that it lead made any misrepresentations to him relative to the coverage.</div><div class="casepar">In answer to interrogatories served upon it the insurer asserted that numerous changes in policy forms had been made during the years since plaintiff started doing business with it, but that these changes are regulated and must be approved by the Insurance Commissioner; that when changes are approved and made the company (as do all others) sends out information relative thereto and new forms for writing policies to its agents, and that such was done in this instance. The changes apply only to policies issued on the new forms, and it has not been the practice to send notices directly to policyholders.</div><div class="casepar">Each of the defendants moved for summary judgment and from denials thereof this appeal was filed, the required certificate for immediate review leaving been obtained.</div><div class="casepar">1. Most of the issues before us are controlled by general contract law, insurance being a matter of contract. Cherokee Credit Life Ins. Co. v. Baker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/75/index.html">119 Ga. App. 579</a></span>(1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/75/index.html">168 SE2d 171</a></span>). "There is no greater sanctity and no more mystery about a contract of insurance than any other. The same rules of construction apply to it as to other contracts." Clay v. Phoenix Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">97 Ga. 44</span>, 53 (<span class="casemissing">25 SE 417</span>). Accord: North British &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Tye, <span class="casemissing">1 Ga. App. 380</span>(1) (<span class="casemissing">58 SE 110</span>). " 'It is well to keep in mind . . . that insurance is purely a matter of contract.' " Mitchell v. Federal Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 206</span>, 208 (<span class="casemissing">194 SE 921</span>).</div><div class="casepar">2. Plaintiff's first three-year policy was extended from year to year upon the payment of an additional year's premium until expiration of the three-year term. The current policy is upon a standard form, approved by the State Insurance Commissioner as the law provides. It made some changes in the coverage as compared with the prior policy. It was a new contract, qualifying as a renewal as renewals are defined in Citizens Oil Co. v. Head, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 542 (2) (40 SE2d 559)</span>. The parties are free to make their own contracts, within the prescribed bounds of law, and the courts are not authorized, by interpretation, to rewrite or to change them, or to extend the coverage. McCullough v. Kirby, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 738 (5) (51 SE2d 812)</span>; West View Corp. v. Alston, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/49/index.html">208 Ga. 122</a></span>, 127 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/49/index.html">65 SE2d 406</a></span>). This principle applies to insurance contracts. Cato v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. 392</span>, 398 (<span class="casemissing">138 SE 787</span>); Hartford Accident &amp;c. Co. v.

The representations alleged to leave been made by the agent of the insurer, whether prior to or after the loss, to the effect that the insured was "fully covered" can amount to no more than an opinion as to coverage or a legal opinion as to the effect or the contract, which does not give rise to actionable fraud. See Self v. American Nat. Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 251 (2) (180 SE 21)</span>; Home Ins. Co. v. Montgomery, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga.

There was no relationship of principal and agent between the insured and the agent of the insurer, and thus no fiduciary relationship. Sherwin-Williams Co. v.

Nor does the expression of an opinion as to coverage work an estoppel even against the agent who voiced it, or against his principal. Trust Co. of Ga. v. S. &amp; W. Cafeteria, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../689/09/index.html">97 Ga. App. 268</a></span>, 285 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../689/09/index.html">103 SE2d 63</a></span>). Fowler v.

"The insurance company might have been willing to insure the stock of goods and ten bales of hay for a certain premium, and yet unwilling, for the same premium, to insure the same goods if it had known that sixty bales of hay were stored in the building." Alston v. Greenwich Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">100 Ga. 282</span>, 285 (<span class="casemissing">29 SE 266</span>). And see Sasser v. Coastal States Life Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../647/61/index.html">113 Ga. App. 17</a></span>, 20, supra. "The requirement of certainty extends not only to the subject matter and purpose of the contract, but also to the parties, consideration, and even the time and place of performance, where these are essential. Its terms must be such that neither party can reasonably misunderstand them. It would be inequitable to carry a contract into effect where the court is left to ascertain the intention of the parties by mere guess or conjecture, because it might be guilty of erroneously decreeing what the parties never intended or contemplated." Williams v. Manchester Building Supply Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../176/19/index.html">213 Ga. 99</a></span>, 101 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../176/19/index.html">97 SE2d 129</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">If it be conceded that the representations were made, what did they mean? Did a statement that you are "fully covered" mean that everything plaintiff had was covered, or did it mean that certain items or types of property were covered to their full value? Since each of the policies provided limited coverage for the items in question, how could "fully covered" square with either of them? The representations are no more certain than a provision in an employment contract that services are to be performed "at a price to be agreed on" (Oliver Construction Co. v. Beeder, <span class="casemissing">7 Ga. App. 276 (66 SE 955)</span>), or an agreement to purchase certain shares of stock "at a price to be mutually agreed upon of not less than $1,500." Martin v. Cox, <span class="casemissing">13 Ga. App. 236 (79 SE 39)</span>. It is fully as indefinite as an agreement to sell "all the boxes wanted." McCaw Mfg. Co. v. Felder, <span class="casemissing">115 Ga. 408 (41 SE 664)</span>. And see Morrow v. Southern Express Co., <span class="casemissing">101 Ga. 810 (28 SE 998)</span>; Burden v. Thomas, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../672/39/index.html">104 Ga. App. 300 (121 SE2d 684)</a></span>. The alleged representations cannot snake a contract.</div><div class="casepar">And for the reasons stated in other Divisions hereof the representations, even if made, did not constitute actionable fraud.</div><div class="casepar">7. The representations alleged to have been made are uncertain and ambiguous, but the policy issued, delivered and kept by the plaintiff is plain, certain and entirely free of ambiguity as to the coverage. "[W]hen the policy limits the coverage in unambiguous terms, as was done here, courts, despite their dislike of such coverage, have no choice but to accept without alteration all such terms and limit liability thereto." State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Sewell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../149/05/index.html">223 Ga. 31</a></span>, 32 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../149/05/index.html">153 SE2d 432</a></span>). We do not deal with a binder here, but with a complete policy that was issued and delivered many months before the loss occurred.</div><div class="casepar">The attempt to expand or extend the coverage by evidence of statements made by the selling agent to the insured to the effect that the insured was "fully covered," and thus convert a definite, plain and certain provision of the contract into one indefinite, uncertain and ambiguous must fail. Cf. Fowler v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 765</span>, 770 (<span class="casemissing">38 SE2d 60</span>); Sasser v. Coastal States Life Ins.
