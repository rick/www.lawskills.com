Muscogee Superior Court. Before Judge Johnston.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">We have consolidated two appeals from appellant Mark Christensen. One challenges his criminal conviction for aggravated battery, and the second challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to recuse.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A00A0517</div><div class="casepar">A Muscogee County jury found Christensen guilty of aggravated battery arising from an incident that occurred during a pick-up soccer game involving Christensen and other professional players. During heated play, Christensen punched another player in the eye. The victim's eye socket was fractured, and he received multiple stitches; pictures introduced at trial showed that his eye was severely blackened. Christensen appeals his conviction, raising nine enumerations of error. Upon review, we find Christensen's contentions meritless and affirm.</div><div class="casepar">1. Christensen first claims that the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury on (a) simple battery, and (b) "opprobrious words" as a defense thereto. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">(a) While the trial court did not charge on misdemeanor simple battery under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23/index.html">16-5-23</a></span> (a) (1), the court charged on misdemeanor battery under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23.1/index.html">16-5-23.1</a></span> (a) and (b). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> This is because the State proved that the victim sustained a substantially blackened eye. There was no evidence to the contrary. A charge on simple battery would be applicable if the State does not prove that the harm is visible per OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23.1/index.html">16-5-23.1</a></span> (b) or if there is some question in that regard which might create a jury issue. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> In this case, however, there was no evidence to support a simple battery charge under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23/index.html">16-5-23</a></span> because it went undisputed that the injury to the victim consisted of "visible bodily harm" and that the victim's eye was substantially blackened as a result of Christensen's punch. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Further, harm as well as error must be shown to warrant reversal. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> "Battery" is a more aggravated offense than "simple battery" because, while both offenses are misdemeanors and share the same elements, "battery" requires proof of the additional element of "substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> The offense of "aggravated battery" is a felony which requires additional proof of (i) malice, and (ii) bodily harm which disfigures or renders a member of the victim's body useless. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In this case, the trial court gave the jury the option to find Christensen guilty of the lesser included offense of misdemeanor battery or of felony aggravated battery as indicted. By its verdict, the jury found the additional aggravating circumstances necessary to convict on the greater felony offense. Since the jury rejected misdemeanor battery and found the additional aggravating elements to warrant felony conviction, we reject the idea that the jury might have reached a different result had they also been charged on the even less culpable misdemeanor of simple battery. Accordingly, "any error in this instruction on the lesser included offense was rendered harmless by the jury's verdicts finding defendant guilty of the greater offense of [aggravated battery] in each alleged instance." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(b) Opprobrious or "abusive language" can be a justification for simple battery. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> However, Christensen was not charged with simple battery, and simple battery was not a lesser included offense in this case. Accordingly, "abusive language" is not an applicable defense. "By its clear terms, the defense is limited to the offense of simple battery; it does not apply to the offense of battery." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Further, Christensen specifically testified that he hit the victim, not because of any abusive language used, but because he thought the victim was going to hit him:</div><div class="casepar">[Christensen:] I was afraid he was going to hit me with his right hand when he dropped his shoulder to step back and if you swing from the right hand side, that's the side that you would block the punch if he was throwing right handed. . . .</div><div class="casepar">[Defense counsel:] Okay. And the reason you did that, you were afraid he was about to hit you?</div><div class="casepar">[Christensen:] Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">Christensen took the stand and testified as to his intent in committing the act. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Without any claim whatsoever by Christensen that he committed the offense because of abusive language, he was not entitled to a jury charge on abusive language as a justification for his committing the offense.</div><div class="casepar">Finally, the jury rejected the misdemeanor offense of battery and found the additional elements necessary to convict on felony aggravated battery. "Abusive language" is not a defense to felony aggravated battery. Since, as a matter of law, an "abusive language" defense under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/25/index.html">16-5-25</a></span> would not apply to the offense for which Christensen was convicted, the failure to give such instruction is rendered harmless. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span></div><div class="casepar">2. There was no error in the trial court's charge to the jury on the offense of aggravated battery The court charged on the language of the statute, the elements of the offense, and that the State must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Also, we find no conflict between the trial court's charge that the victim's loss of the use of his eye need not be permanent and the allegation in the indictment that Christensen rendered the victim's eye "useless." The court's charge was a correct statement of the law. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> "The fortuitous fact that complete and permanent blindness did not result hardly suffices to create a fatal variance between allegata and probata." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. Christensen next asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict. A motion for directed verdict is authorized only when there is no evidence to support a conviction. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> In this case, the testimony of the victim and several eyewitnesses regarding Christensen s unprovoked attack on the victim, as well as pictures of the severity of the injury to the victim's eye and expert testimony with regard thereto, was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. The expert medical testimony offered in rebuttal to the State's evidence provides no basis to reverse. Such is addressed to the credibility of the witnesses, and an appellate court does not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses. In this case, the refusal to direct a verdict of acquittal based on sufficiency grounds was proper. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span></div><div class="casepar">4. The trial court admitted evidence of a similar transaction incident wherein Christensen punched a man in the face as a result of "road rage." On appeal, Christensen does not contest his identity as the perpetrator of the prior act. Nor does he contest the similarity of the independent offense. His contention is that the trial court should not have permitted the investigating officer to testify as to a statement made by the victim of the prior act.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court found that the victim's statement was made 18 minutes after the incident, while the victim was still on the side of the road holding his bleeding face. The court determined that such statement was part of the res gestae of the prior offense, and the court permitted the officer to testify as to his investigation into the facts of incident, including the victim's res gestae statement. "A trial court's determination that evidence is admissible as part of the res gestae will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> Under the facts of this case and Christensen's error as enumerated, we do not find the trial court's admission of the evidence to be clearly erroneous. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span></div><div class="casepar">5. Christensen contends that the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to recall in surrebuttal two defense witnesses to rebut the testimony of Christensen's ex-wife, Linda. However, we find no error.</div><div class="casepar">Linda Christensen was called by the State and testified that Christensen beat her about the head and face with his fists after he came home one evening upset because he had been ejected from a soccer game. Pictures of the injuries sustained by Linda Christensen were introduced. Thereafter, the defense wished to call two surrebuttal witnesses -- not to refute the fact that Christensen had beaten his ex-wife -- but to testify that Christensen had never been ejected from a soccer game. We find that this evidence would have only tangentially rebutted the substance of Linda Christensen's testimony. Moreover, both witnesses had testified previously that Christensen had never been ejected from a soccer game. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit the witnesses to testify. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source19" href="#note19">19</a></span></div><div class="casepar">6. At the onset of the trial court's charge to the jury, the judge instructed the jury regarding the indictment as a legal document. The court's instructions included an explanation of the evidentiary significance of the indictment as "not evidence of his [Christensen's] guilt nor is it evidence of his innocence by his plea of not guilty."</div><div class="casepar">We disapprove of this portion of the trial court's instruction since a defendant need not supply "evidence of his innocence." A criminal defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the trial court's instruction as to "evidence of innocence" can serve only to confuse, even if such explanation was made solely in relation to the evidentiary value of an indictment.</div><div class="casepar">However, jury instructions are not to be read in isolation. In this case, the trial court properly instructed the jury on Christensen's presumption of innocence and the State's burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. While the trial court's preliminary charge in relation to the indictment was confusing, it was not reversible error in light of the jury charge as a whole. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span></div><div class="casepar">7. We find no error in the trial court's instruction to the jury that "[t]he outcome of this case has absolutely nothing to do with the civil case that the victim has filed against the defendant and the CYSA [Cobb Youth Soccer Association]." From the context in which this charge was given, it is clear that the court was instructing the jury that the outcome of this case, i.e., Christensen's guilt or innocence, should be decided based on the evidence and the charge of the court, without regard to the outcome's effect on the civil case. This was a correct statement of the law, and the trial court did not limit the legitimate purpose for which evidence of the civil case was introduced, i.e., as a challenge to the credibility of the victim.</div><div class="casepar">8. Christensen contends that the trial court's recharge on aggravated battery gave "undue weight" to that offense. We do not agree. Generally, "the scope and content of additional jury instructions are left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court may address only the jury's request on a particular point or give additional instructions." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span> In this case, the jury requested a recharge on aggravated battery. The record shows the jury wanted clarification as to the elemental differences between battery and aggravated battery: "[Foreperson:] We were just trying to determine the difference between the two charges. What makes battery aggravated and what doesn't." The trial court then recharged on both battery and aggravated battery substantially as the court had originally charged. We find no abuse of discretion in the recharge.</div><div class="casepar">9. The trial court did not err by refusing to give a jury charge on the law relating to "retreat." While Christensen claimed self-defense in that he thought the victim was going to hit him, there was no contention by the State that Christensen should have run away or otherwise "retreated" from the confrontation. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source22" href="#note22">22</a></span> Accordingly, the issue of "retreat" was not raised by the evidence or placed in issue. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source23" href="#note23">23</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Case No. A00A0518</div><div class="casepar">On April 9, 1999, Christensen believed that the trial judge had a bias against him in the judicial proceedings. On April 12, 1999, his counsel had an affidavit and motion to recuse prepared and read into the record prior to trial. However, a motion to recuse was not filed. On May 26, 1999, the trial court entered an order that prior to filing the trial transcript, the trial court would review the transcript for errors.</div><div class="casepar">After trial and sentencing, Christensen filed a motion to recuse on July 14, 1999, based upon conduct of the trial court during trial and the order regarding the transcript inspection, which was denied as untimely by the trial court on July 23, 1999. On June 25, 1999, the trial court vacated its order as it pertained to inspecting the transcript prior to filing. On July 14, 1999, the defendant also filed an extraordinary motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence dealing with the trial court's order that the trial court review the transcript of the trial for errors prior to filing. On July 23, 1999, this extraordinary motion was also denied as not setting forth legal grounds for recusal.</div><div class="casepar">10. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to recuse the trial judge. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">Upon filing a motion to recuse under Uniform Superior Court Rule 25.3, the trial judge has the immediate duty to determine (1) if the motion has been timely filed; (2) the legal sufficiency of the affidavit; and (3) if the motion to recuse states a legal ground for recusal, i.e., assuming the facts alleged are true "whether recusal would be warranted." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source24" href="#note24">24</a></span> USCR 25.1 requires that the motion to recuse be made within five days after first learning of the basis for recusal, and not later than ten days prior to trial or hearing, or "unless good cause be shown for failure to meet such time requirements."</div><div class="casepar">(a) In regard to the motion to recuse of July 14, 1999, the trial court determined that it was untimely, which is the first duty of such judge when a motion to recuse is filed. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span> The bases for recusal were matters that were known on April 12, 1999, occurred during trial, or arose out of the entry of the order of May 26, 1999.

This case arose from an incident during a soccer game in which the defendant threw one punch after being called a motherf--r. Although initially sentenced to twenty years confinement with ten years to serve and ten years on probation, the trial court later reduced the sentence to seven years with two years to be served in confinement and the balance on probation. In the same order, the trial court gave Christensen credit for time served, allowed him to serve the balance of the two years under supervised probation, and ordered his immediate release from confinement. One of the terms of Christensen's probation required him to have treated the tuberculosis he contracted.</div><div class="casepar">The charge against Christensen arose from an incident at a pick-up soccer game in a gymnasium. Based on the testimony, several skilled players were involved in a highly competitive game with extensive physical contact. Christensen and the victim became particularly physical, with extensive pushing and shoving and taunting between them. Finally, a direct confrontation ensued, and Christensen struck the victim in the face one time with his fist. According to one witness, Christensen struck the victim after the victim called him a motherf--r. After the victim fell to the floor, Christensen stood over him yelling for him to get up. Christensen testified that he hit the victim because he believed that the victim was about to hit him.</div><div class="casepar">When those assisting the victim were unable to stop the bleeding, the victim was taken to the hospital where it was discovered that he had suffered an injury to the bone under his eye. The victim required stitches to his eyelid and the next day had double vision. The victim testified that he had double vision after his initial surgery and that the condition lasted for five or six months.</div><div class="casepar">At trial, the evidence conflicted on the degree to which the injuries were permanent. The victim's treating physician testified that the victim had a cut that ran through his eyelid, some swelling around the eye, and complained about intermittent double vision and pain when he looked up. Further examination showed that the victim had a fracture on the floor of his eye socket. The treating physician also testified that after treatment, the victim did not look like anything was wrong with him. After he was discharged from treatment, the victim never contacted this doctor again.</div><div class="casepar">Christensen called expert witnesses who testified that the victim's medical records did not support his claim of double vision. After his injury, the victim's eye sight was 20/20; he has no vision restrictions on his driver's license. In the fall after this incident, he played on a championship soccer team. Another physician, who examined the victim shortly before the trial, testified that he could not find in the treating physician's comments that the victim claimed he had double vision while looking to his left. According to this physician, the victim's medical records showed that the victim had complained of double vision with extreme upward and downward gaze shortly after the operation but later complained of double vision only on the upward gaze.</div><div class="casepar">1. Christensen contends that the trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury on simple battery as a lesser included offense and refusing to charge on opprobrious words as a defense to simple battery. Although the trial court agreed initially that it would give a charge on simple battery, it ultimately decided to charge only battery with physical harm as a lesser included offense. Further, the trial court refused to give a charge on opprobrious words as a defense to simple battery.</div><div class="casepar">Further,</div><div class="casepar">even if a lesser offense is not included in a charged offen se as a general matter because the two offenses have different elements, the lesser offense may be an included offense in a particular case if the facts alleged in the indictment and the evidence presented at trial to establish the charged offense are sufficient to establish the lesser offense as well.</div><div class="casepar">Messick v.

Therefore, the only issue is whether simple battery was raised by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">Under our law, "A person commits the offense of simple battery when he or she either: (1) Intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another; or (2) Intentionally causes physical harm to another."

App. 282</a></span>, 283 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../248/65/index.html">502 SE2d 266</a></span>) (1998) ("maliciously" means "intentionally and without justification or serious provocation"). Thus, based on Christensen's testimony that he struck the victim, after the victim had used the offensive language, because he believed the victim was about to hit him, evidence exists from which the jury could conclude that Christensen's conduct was not malicious.</div><div class="casepar">Christensen's testimony about his reason for hitting the victim also necessitates a charge on the lesser included offense of simple battery (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23/index.html">16-5-23</a></span>) even though the trial court gave a charge on battery (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23.1/index.html">16-5-23.1</a></span>). For Christensen to be convicted of either of these offenses it is not sufficient that physical harm, substantial or visible bodily harm, or bodily harm result. Christensen must have intentionally or maliciously caused the resulting harm. Therefore, the issue for the jury was not just whether the victim's injury met the requisite degree of harm to constitute simple battery, battery, or aggravated battery, but whether Christensen acted with the required intent to inflict the injury. The issue for the jury also should have been whether Christensen intentionally caused the victim substantial physical injury or visible bodily harm (see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/23.1/index.html">16-5-23.1</a></span>) or whether he intentionally caused him physical harm.

Therefore, I believe that our law requires a charge on the lesser included offense of simple battery. Edwards v. State, supra, 264 Ga. at 133.</div><div class="casepar">Although the majority would dismiss this error because the jury found Christensen guilty of the most serious offense, I do not believe we can merely assume that the jury would have reached the result it did if a proper charge was given. This is particularly true since a charge on simple battery as a lesser included offense necessarily implicated a charge on the defense of opprobrious words.</div><div class="casepar">A person charged with the offense of simple assault or simple battery may introduce in evidence any opprobrious or abusive language used by the person against whom force was threatened or used; and the trier of facts may, in its discretion, find that the words used were justification for simple assault or simple battery.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/25/index.html">16-5-25</a></span>.

App. 740</span>, 742 (<span class="casemissing">16 SE2d 483</span>) (1941). Therefore, the trial court also erred by refusing to give this charge, and a new trial is required. It is mere speculation for us to conclude that the jury would have convicted Christensen of aggravated battery if a charge on this defense had been given.</div><div class="casepar">2. Christensen also alleges that the trial court erred by instructing the jury as follows:</div><div class="casepar">Now ladies and gentlemen, it is true that an indictment by a grand jury is not evidence of guilt nor is the plea of not guilty by the defendant evidence of innocence. What an indictment is, however, is a legal document that is used in the United States of America and in most jurisdictions and in other states in this country to say that there is probable cause for an individual to be tried for the offense for which the grand jury indicted this individual. In the United States of America, we do not simply jerk someone off the street and say you are accused of a crime and then come into some court somewhere and try them. The case goes before a grand jury and a grand jury hears testimony and they decide if there is enough evidence to accuse the defendant of aggravated battery. While it is not evidence of his guilt nor is it evidence of his innocence by his plea of not guilty. It is an official document and it has a place in the legal system. As I am required to do by the law, I shall at this time read you the indictment in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court then read the indictment to the jury. Later, the court made the following comments:</div><div class="casepar">Now ladies and gentlemen, every Tuesday the grand jury meets and these indictments have to be returned in open court. That means one of us superior court judges, usually it's around lunch time, comes in and has the deputy open the courtroom, the bailiff from the grand jury turns these indictments over to the court. The court then turns them over to the clerk or the deputy clerk and the deputy clerk takes them to the superior court clerk's office on the second floor and they are filed and a number placed on them. This true bill was returned and signed by the foreperson, James N. King, on or about January 18, 1999, and it was filed and the [sic] stamped signature of M. Linda Pearce, Clerk of the Superior Court. It was in the December term of 1998, a term is two months, December and January. As I say, it is not evidence or proof of what it says nor is the plea of not guilty. But it is a legal document by which this case is brought before you for your consideration and determination.</div><div class="casepar">Christensen made a timely objection to this charge asserting that the charge gave undue weight to the indictment. I agree.</div><div class="casepar">The charge correctly instructed the jury that the indictment was not evidence and, at the same time, informed the jury that the indictment was an official, legal document. This charge was confusing and also, in effect, told the jury that they should consider that an indictment was rendered in reaching their decision. Also, by suggesting that some weight should be given to the indictment, the charge conflicted with the pattern jury instruction that an indictment "should not [be] consider[ed] . . . as evidence or implication of guilt." Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Crim. Cases, 2nd ed., Part 2, C. Under the circumstances, the instruction was unnecessary, confusing, and wrong. As charging errors are presumed harmful unless the record shows the error was harmless, and in my view the record does not support such a conclusion, I believe that Christensen's conviction should be reversed.
