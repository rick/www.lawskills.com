The powder cocaine maintained by the lab comes from two cases dating from 1982 and 1985. In each case, approximately 1,000 kilograms of cocaine had been thrown from an airplane.</div><div class="casepar">Mills testified that when this cocaine was no longer needed for evidentiary purposes in connection with the cases against the pilots, the laboratory kept it for future use in reverse stings. The laboratory has verified that these substances are cocaine. Law enforcement authorities may borrow cocaine from the laboratory for use in reverse stings. If the operation leads to criminal prosecution, the cocaine is returned to the laboratory, assigned a case number, and reanalyzed to verify what the substance is.

State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/56/index.html">211 Ga.

Both Giraldo and Brutus were arrested in the operation. The cocaine was returned and assigned a case number, and an official report was prepared.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court examined the testimony presented at the hearing and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to meet the requirements under Dean v. Gober that "the owner of the drug [be] known" and that forfeiture proceedings had not been commenced against those drugs. Therefore, the court concluded, the State crime lab was lawfully in possession of the cocaine used in the reverse sting operation against Giraldo and Brutus.</div><div class="casepar">We hold the court did not err in refusing to dismiss the indictments or to suppress the contraband based on such evidence. First, since the State maintained records and showed the trial Court who owned the cocaine used in the reverse sting operation, the cocaine was not summarily forfeited to the State and thus the State was not immediately required to destroy same. Second, even if the State were required to destroy the cocaine, the State's conduct here in failing to meet this obligation and in using the cocaine in a common reverse sting operation does not rise to the level of outrageous conduct that violated fundamental notions of due process and that prejudiced the defendants. Regardless of where the State obtained the cocaine, defendants were not authorized to purchase same.</div><div class="casepar">1. Although the provision in the forfeiture statute requiring destruction of the cocaine was not enacted until 1991, it applies to the cocaine acquired by the crime lab in 1982 and 1985.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> is part of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted in 1974, but section 49 was rewritten in 1991 and made effective on July 1 of that year. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> The subsection requiring destruction of certain property was not a part of the earlier version. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> But the revised Code section states that it applies to property recovered prior to the effective date if "such property was subject to forfeiture under the laws of this state at the time such act or omission occurred." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Under former Code Ann.  79A-828 (now OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span>), the following were subject to forfeiture: "All controlled substances and marijuana which have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, held, or acquired in violation of this article." And the GBI director testified that the contraband acquired in both the 1982 and 1985 cases is "for lack of a better term, boat cocaine; in other words, cocaine that's been manufactured and prepared down in Colombia and smuggled into the U. S." It follows that the cocaine was subject to forfeiture under the earlier version of the statute and that, therefore, the revised statute applies to the 1982 and 1985 airplane cocaine.</div><div class="casepar">2. The cocaine was not summarily forfeited to the State under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (y) and therefore was not subject to immediate destruction. Dean v. Gober <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> expressly held that so long as the police keep records of the ownership of non-Schedule I drugs confiscated in previous investigations and so long as forfeiture proceedings have not been commenced, police are authorized to retain the drugs and to use them in reverse sting operations. Here no forfeiture proceedings had been commenced, and the State maintained records showing the origin of the cocaine (a Schedule II drug <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span>) held by the State crime lab. The State presented this evidence of record-keeping to the trial court, which, based on the evidence, found as fact that the State had shown the owner of the cocaine. As there was some evidence to support this finding, we will not disturb it. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> Therefore, the State was fully authorized to use these drugs in this particular reverse sting operation.</div><div class="casepar">The special concurrence reads OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> to conclude, contrary to Dean v. Gober, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> that the State can never retain illegal drugs for reverse sting operations because no one can ever "own" these drugs. As explained in Dean v. Gober, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> the obligation of the State is simply to maintain accurate records as to the origin of the drugs; an esoteric analysis interpreting away the ability of anyone to "own" these drugs simply misses the mark, since law enforcement officers are authorized by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/35/index.html">16-13-35</a></span> (c) (4) to possess controlled substances while acting in the scope of their official duties. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. Even if the State were obligated to destroy the cocaine at issue, the State's failure to do so does not violate any fundamental notions of due process such that a dismissal of the indictments or a suppression of this contraband would be required. As explained in Gober v. State, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span> such sins of omission by the police come nowhere near the affirmative outrageous conduct that must be shown to constitute a violation of due process requiring a bar to prosecution or justifying a dismissal of these indictments or a suppression of this contraband. The origin of the drugs would in no way undermine a finding that these defendants, without legal authorization, knowingly purchased or possessed the cocaine.</div><div class="casepar">Nevertheless, we do not wish to promote law enforcement's collection and storage of excessive amounts of illegal drugs. The better practice would be to create a strict procedure governing the retention of illegal drugs from prior investigations, which procedure would set forth the amount of drugs that may be retained and the length of time they may be retained. Also, there should be strict controls on the use of these drugs in law enforcement operations such as the reverse sting operation here. For this reason, we invite and encourage the legislature to develop such guidelines.</div><div class="casepar">POPE, Presiding Judge, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">Although I concede that the improper use of drugs that should have been destroyed does not rise to the level of outrageous conduct as described in the case law, the forfeiture statute clearly required destruction of the cocaine used against Giraldo and Brutus long before it was used against them in a reverse sting. And, I cannot condone use of such drugs under the circumstances. If the legislature intended to allow the practice, it should revise the statute to make it clear. See Gober v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../53/index.html">249 Ga. App. 168 (547 SE2d 656) (2001)</a></span> (Pope, P. J., concurring specially). Also, I write separately to address two other matters.</div><div class="casepar">First, Dean v. Gober, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../423/index.html">272 Ga. 20 (524 SE2d 722) (2000)</a></span>, did not, as claimed by the majority, hold that so long as the police keep ownership records for confiscated non-Schedule I controlled substances, they are authorized to use them in reverse stings. Rather, it held that those substances can be used if they have a known owner, but controlled substances whose owners are unknown are summarily forfeited and must be destroyed. Certainly it follows that the failure to keep ownership records would preclude showing the identity of an owner, but keeping ownership records was not the determinative fact. What if the records they keep show no owner? Thus, in this case, the simple fact that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has records is not sufficient. There still must be proof of a known owner in order to exempt non-Schedule I drugs from forfeiture and destruction.</div><div class="casepar">Although on appeal the slight evidence presented might be sufficient to uphold that factual finding, because the drugs at issue in this case were admittedly illegally manufactured and possessed, there can be no owner of the controlled substances, and therefore, they should have been destroyed.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (a) (7) provides that a person is an owner if they have "an interest in [the] property." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (d) (1) provides that all controlled substances "that have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, possessed, or acquired in violation of" the Georgia Controlled Substances Act "are declared to be contraband and no person shall have a property right in them." And the GBI deputy director testified that the contraband acquired in both the 1982 and 1985 cases is "for lack of a better term, boat cocaine; in other words, cocaine that's been manufactured and prepared down in Colombia and smuggled into the U. S." Therefore, because the two stashes of cocaine in the GBI laboratory are illegal "boat cocaine," no person has a property right in them; they can have no owner.</div><div class="casepar">It is true that in Dean v. Gober, the Supreme Court recognized that non-Schedule I controlled substances can have a known owner. 272 Ga. at 24 (4). Indeed, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/35/index.html">16-13-35</a></span> (c) (4) authorizes certain persons to, among other things, manufacture controlled substances provided they are properly registered. And deputy director Terry Mills admitted that it is possible to purchase pharmaceutical-grade cocaine. Thus, properly registered persons would be examples of known owners of a controlled substance. But, construed together, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (d) and (e) mean that there can be a known owner only if the substance has not been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, possessed, or acquired in violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> In this case, the substance was illegal cocaine, and therefore, there can be no known owner.</div><div class="casepar">Also, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/35/index.html">16-13-35</a></span> (c) (4) allows officers and employees of the state while acting in the course of their official duties to possess controlled substances. But, read together with subsections (d), (u) (1), and (y) of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span>, this statute means that the officers must destroy all controlled substances that have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, possessed, or acquired in violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act that are no longer needed for evidentiary purposes in the matter in which they were acquired, although they may possess any drugs that do not fall into these categories.</div><div class="casepar">Dean v. Gober did not address this specific point. It held only that the police may use confiscated drugs where there is a known owner. But it did not consider or construe OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (d) and its clear pronouncement that no person can own illegally manufactured drugs. Nor did it consider who can be an owner of Schedule II controlled substances. Although the majority attacks this writer's construction of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (d) and (e), it does not offer any explanation of the meaning of those Code subsections. The majority's conclusions are not based on reading the statute as a whole.</div><div class="casepar">In short, because the cocaine stored by the GBI is illegally manufactured cocaine, it cannot have a known owner. Under Dean v. Gober, because the owner of the cocaine stockpile was unknown, those drugs had been summarily forfeited pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (y) and "their destruction was mandated by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/13/49/index.html">16-13-49</a></span> (u) (1)." Dean v. Gober, 272 Ga. at 22 (1). It was a violation of the amended forfeiture statute for the GBI to keep it because it was no longer needed for evidentiary purposes in connection with the 1982 and 1985 incidents. Accordingly, the cocaine should have been destroyed long before some of it was used in a reverse sting against Giraldo and Brutus.</div><div class="casepar">J.
