Before Judge Winn.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Appellant, Robert Franklin Godfrey, was tried in Polk County for the murder of his wife and mother-in-law and for aggravated assault on his eleven-year-old daughter. Following his conviction by a jury, he was sentenced to death for each of the murders and to 10 years imprisonment for the aggravated assault. He appeals to this court on enumerated errors and for mandatory review of the death sentences imposed.</div><div class="casepar">I. Summary of the Evidence</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence presented in court from which the jury was authorized to find the following:</div><div class="casepar">On September 5 1977, appellant's wife left him after he cut some of her clothes off her body with a knife. She moved in with her other, refused to move back home, and filed for divorce. She also charged him with aggravated assault.</div><div class="casepar">On the morning of September 20, 1977, Appellant, who was employed as a male nurse, told a female nurse that he was getting a divorce and it would all be over on the twenty-first. (The divorce hearing was set for the twenty-second.) On the same day, Appellant's mother-in-law called him at work and told him that Mrs. Godfrey would telephone him that evening. She did call, but would not agree to halt the divorce proceedings for an attempted reconciliation. Mrs. Godfrey called back later and again refused to attempt reconciliation.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant took his single action rifle-shotgun and walked to the mother-in-law's trailer home, in which Mrs. Godfrey, her daughter, and her mother were playing a game around a table. Appellant killed his wife by shooting her in the head, firing through a window. He struck his eleven-year-old daughter on the head with the barrel of the gun as she ran for help. Appellant then shot his mother-in-law, killing her. He then called the Polk County Sheriff's office, identified himself, reported the crimes and gave directions to the trailer. He waited at the scene until a policeman arrived. Appellant told the policeman "they're dead. I killed them," and directed the policeman to the murder weapon which was resting in the branches of an apple tree.</div><div class="casepar">After being arrested and advised of his rights, appellant was taken to the police station where he told a police officer that he had committed a "hideous crime" which he had thought about for eight years and would do again.</div><div class="casepar">The theory of the defense at trial was insanity. The defense psychiatrist described Appellant's behavior during the murders as a "dissociative attack," but did not testify that this was a psychosis of any kind. Appellant denied remembering anything from the time of his second telephone conversation with Mrs. Godfrey until he "woke up" in jail the following day. The defense psychiatrist testified that Appellant could not remember the crimes even after receiving an injection of sodium amytal, a "truth serum," although the drug did not affect him as much as most people, perhaps because of his history of heavy drinking.</div><div class="casepar">The state presented testimony from experts and other witnesses that Appellant was sane and could distinguish right from wrong.</div><div class="casepar">II. Enumerations of Error</div><div class="casepar">1. Enumerations of error 1, 2 and 3 incorporate what are generally referred to as the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">On appeal this court does not review the weight of the evidence but examines its sufficiency. Peek v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../100/53/index.html">239 Ga. 422 (238 SE2d 12) (1977)</a></span>. If there is any evidence to support it the verdict will not be disturbed on appeal. Drake v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../959/5/index.html">241 Ga. 583</a></span>, 585 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../959/5/index.html">247 SE2d 57</a></span>) (1978); Campbell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/3/index.html">240 Ga. 352</a></span>, 354 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/3/index.html">240 SE2d 828</a></span>) (1977). There was abundant evidence admitted at trial to support these verdicts.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's contention that the evidence as to his sanity raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt is without merit; there was absolutely no evidence, even from the defense psychiatrist, that Appellant had been at any time pyschotic or "insane." See Spivey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">241 Ga. 477</a></span>, 478 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">246 SE2d 288</a></span>) (1978). These enumerations are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. Enumeration 5 and 14 urge that the trial court erred in admitting over objection certain photographs taken at the scene of the crime depicting the victims' wounds and the surrounding area. Portions of the heads of both victims were literally blown away, and when officers arrived blood was dripping from the ceiling of the trailer.</div><div class="casepar">We have repeatedly held that photographs of this sort are generally admissible. E.g., Stevens v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../912/2/index.html">242 Ga. 34</a></span>, 38 (<span class="casemissing">247 SE2d 38</span>) (1978); Burger v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../912/1/index.html">242 Ga. 28</a></span>, 31 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../912/1/index.html">247 SE2d 834</a></span>) (1978); White v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../911/8/index.html">242 Ga. 21</a></span>, 22 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../911/8/index.html">247 SE2d 759</a></span>) (1978); Lamb v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../941/6/index.html">241 Ga. 10</a></span>, 13 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../941/6/index.html">243 SE2d 59</a></span>) (1978); Moore v. State, <span class="casemissing">240 Ga. 807</span>, 816 (<span class="casemissing">243 SE2d 1</span>) (1978); Davis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../987/7/index.html">240 Ga. 763</a></span>, 766-767 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../987/7/index.html">243 SE2d 12</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">3. In enumerations 6 and 7, Appellant urges that the grand jury which indicted him was unconstitutionally composed and that it was error to dismiss his motion challenging its composition.</div><div class="casepar">These murders occurred on September 20, 1977; counsel was notified of his appointment to represent Appellant on September 21, 1977; and he has never been relieved of those duties notwithstanding some question he raised concerning Appellant's ability to pay him. Appellant was indicted by the grand jury on December 15, 1978. Thus, Appellant was represented by counsel long before indictment, but no objection to the composition of the grand jury was raised prior to indictment.</div><div class="casepar">The general rule in Georgia is that for a challenge to the array of grand jurors "to be entertained by the trial court, it must be made prior to the return of the indictment or the defendant must show that he had no knowledge, either actual or constructive, of such alleged illegal composition of the grand jury prior to the time the indictment was returned; otherwise, the objection is deemed to be waived. Estes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../122/97/index.html">232 Ga. 703</a></span>, 708 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../122/97/index.html">208 SE2d 806</a></span>) (1974)." Sanders v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../112/85/index.html">235 Ga. 425</a></span>, 426 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../112/85/index.html">219 SE2d 768</a></span>) (1975) cert. den., 425 U. S. 976 (96 SC 2177, 48 LE2d 800) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">There was no showing that Appellant did not have reason to believe that an indictment would be returned against him, having had counsel appointed three months before indictment and having admittedly killed two persons. Holsey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../112/40/index.html">235 Ga. 270 (219 SE2d 374) (1975)</a></span>; Wooten v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/99/index.html">224 Ga. 106 (160 SE2d 403) (1968)</a></span>. There is no contention that the alleged illegality of the grand jury composition was unknown prior to indictment.</div><div class="casepar">To avoid being held to have waived the objection, Appellant argues that the indictment was rendered by a specially summoned grand jury, and he did not expect it until several weeks later. This is not a ground of exemption from the waiver rule. A defendant has no right to be notified in advance of grand jury proceedings, and has no right to be there. Indeed, Howard v. State, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 229</span>, 235-236 (<span class="casemissing">4 SE2d 418</span>) (1939) clearly shows that the state law contemplates that indictments shall be returned in secret, wit out the accused's knowing exactly when.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant was correctly held to have waived his right to object to the composition of the grand jury, and enumerations 6 and 7 are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Even were we to consider the merits of this point, it would fail. The primary thrust of Appellant's attempted evidence at the motion hearing was that persons between 18 and 21 years of age were not present on the grand jury although Georgia law now authorizes them to serve. This does not show illegality of the grand jury: age is not a recognized class for purposes of grand jury representation. Fouts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../962/6/index.html">240 Ga. 39</a></span>, 41 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../962/6/index.html">239 SE2d 366</a></span>) (1977); Barrow v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../997/0/index.html">239 Ga. 162 (236 SE2d 257) (1977)</a></span>; State v. Gould, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../123/39/index.html">232 Ga. 844 (209 SE2d 312) (1974)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. In enumerations 8 and 29, Appellant alleges the trial court erred in refusing to charge the law of manslaughter.</div><div class="casepar">There was no evidence in this case of "sudden, violent and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation" to warrant charging on voluntary manslaughter under Cod Ann.  26-1102.</div><div class="casepar">5. In enumerations 9 and 10, Appellant alleges the trial court erred twice in failing to grant a mistrial, sua sponte. Enumeration 9 complains of the prosecutor's final argument during which a relative of the deceased victims fainted in the courtroom. Enumeration 10 objects to that part of the prosecutor's argument which ridiculed the testimony of the defense psychiatrist. No mistrial motion was made on either ground.</div><div class="casepar">Our review of the supplemental record, containing a transcript of a hearing on these points, shows that the trial court did not err as charged, as no ground for mistrial appears.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, enumerations 9 and 10 are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">6. In enumeration 11, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial upon application of defense counsel showing through one of the bailiffs that the jurors were discussing the case and commenting upon the evidence prior to the start of their deliberations. A bailiff testified that "Well, I heard someone say something about the defendant showing no emotion when he saw those pictures [of the victims]." There was no further evidence.</div><div class="casepar">From the question asked, the bailiff was undoubtedly referring to a juror's comment on the demeanor of the defendant. There is no indication of pre-judgment of evidence in violation of the instructions of the trial court. Nor does it appear that there was an unauthorized communication to a bailiff. Under these circumstances the trial court did not err in denying the Appellant's motion for a mistrial. See, Battle v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../116/10/index.html">234 Ga. 637 (217 SE2d 255) (1975)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. In enumeration 15, Appellant complains of the overruling of his motion for a continuance. A continuance was sought to allow further time to prepare for trial and to allow community sentiment aroused by the crime to cool.</div><div class="casepar">The granting of a continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. Code Ann.  27-2202, 81-1419. Counsel were notified of their appointment on September 21, 1977 and the motion for continuance was filed February 1, 1978, and heard February 9, 1978. Under these circumstances, and in light of our disposition of enumeration 17 below, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion. Campbell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/3/index.html">240 Ga. 352</a></span>, 356 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/3/index.html">240 SE2d 828</a></span>) (1977); Pulliam v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/98/index.html">236 Ga. 460</a></span>, 461-462 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/98/index.html">224 SE2d 8</a></span>) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">8. In enumerations 16 and 21, Appellant alleges the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the two murder charges. He urges that the joint trial of two "gruesome killings is inherently prejudicial." This contention is totally without merit. Code Ann.  26-506 (b) and (c); Stewart v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../101/19/index.html">239 Ga. 588</a></span>, 589 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../101/19/index.html">238 SE2d 540</a></span>) (1977); Jarrell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/54/index.html">234 Ga. 410</a></span>, 413 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/54/index.html">216 SE2d 258</a></span>) (1975); Henderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/65/index.html">227 Ga. 68 (179 SE2d 76) (1970)</a></span>. Neither were counts 1 and 2 objectionable because each was sufficient to charge both felony murder and malice murder.</div><div class="casepar">Enumerations 16 and 21 are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">"The test as to whether pre-trial publicity has so prejudiced a case than an accused cannot receive a fair trial is whether the jurors summoned to try the case have formed fixed opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the accused from the pre-trial publicity. Krist v. Caldwell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../129/06/index.html">230 Ga. 536</a></span>, 537 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../129/06/index.html">198 SE2d 161</a></span>) (1973)." Wilkes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../102/42/index.html">238 Ga. 57</a></span>, 58-59 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../102/42/index.html">230 SE2d 867</a></span>) (1976). Accord, Burnett v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../986/2/index.html">240 Ga. 681</a></span>, 684 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../986/2/index.html">242 SE2d 79</a></span>) (1978). See Code Ann.  27-1101, 27-1201.</div><div class="casepar">After studying the voir dire examination in this case we conclude that it does not show that the jurors selected to try Appellant's case had formed fixed opinions as to guilt or innocence from publicity in the community.</div><div class="casepar">Enumeration 17 is therefore without merit.</div><div class="casepar">10. Appellant alleges in enumeration 18 that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to compel depositions of witnesses, or in the alternative to order a preliminary hearing.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant correctly concedes that there is no statutory provision for depositions or discovery in criminal cases in this state. Brown v. State, <span class="casemissing">238 Ga. 98 (231 SE2d 65) (1976)</span>. After indictment and subsequent conviction the lack of a commitment hearing will not be construed as reversible error. State v. Middlebrooks, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../108/64/index.html">236 Ga. 52 (222 SE2d 343) (1976)</a></span> and cases cited therein. Moreover, the defense attorney was repeatedly given access to the the entire state file, and nothing prevented him from interviewing witnesses. This enumeration is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">11. In enumeration 19, Appellant makes a general attack on the constitutionality of the Georgia death penalty statute and specifically attacks the statutory aggravating circumstance described in Code Ann.  27-2534.1 (b) (7) ("The offense of murder . . . was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim") as unconstitutionally vague.</div><div class="casepar">The Georgia death penalty statute (Ga. L. 1973, p. 159 et seq. (Code Ann.  27-2534.1)) has been upheld by this court and by the Supreme Court of the United States. Gregg v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../117/65/index.html">233 Ga. 117 (210 SE2d 659) (1974)</a></span>; Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (96 SC 2909) (1976). We have previously considered the vagueness issue raised by Appellant, and have upheld Code Ann.  27-2534.1 (b) (7) in Harris v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/98/index.html">237 Ga. 718</a></span>, 731-733 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/98/index.html">230 SE2d 1</a></span>) (1976) and Lamb v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../941/6/index.html">241 Ga. 10</a></span>, 14-15 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../941/6/index.html">243 SE2d 59</a></span>) (1978). The statute is not unconstitutional for any reason alleged.</div><div class="casepar">12. In enumerations 4, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, and 31, Appellant challenges instructions given by the trial court, or contends that the court erred in refusing to give requested instructions.</div><div class="casepar">We have examined each enumeration and find that the court covered the matter correctly in his instructions, or that the requested charge does not correctly reflect the law, or that the giving of the requested charge would have been inappropriate.</div><div class="casepar">13. In enumeration 32 Appellant states that the trial court erred i allowing the district attorney in his argument to read before the jury from decided cases.</div><div class="casepar">Code Ann.  2-3319 provides in part that "Counsel shall not be permitted, in the argument of criminal cases, to read to the jury recitals of fact or the reasoning of the court as applied thereto, in decisions by the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals."</div><div class="casepar">The argument challenged was directed to the trial judge on matters of law. Although the jury was present, reading and arguing law to the court is not reversible error. Potts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../942/9/index.html">241 Ga. 67</a></span>, 75 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../942/9/index.html">243 SE2d 510</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's other enumerations concern matters that will be considered in our sentence review.</div><div class="casepar">III. Sentence Review</div><div class="casepar">In our sentence review we have considered the evidence concerning the crimes of murder and the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and the matters presented by Appellant.</div><div class="casepar">We have reviewed the death sentence as required by Ga. L. 1973, p. 159 et seq. (Code Ann.  27-2537 (c)), as was done in Coley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/11/index.html">231 Ga. 829 (204 SE2d 612) (1974)</a></span>, and each subsequent case involving the death penalty under this statute.</div><div class="casepar">With regard to the sentence our first consideration is:</div><div class="casepar">"Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor" Code Ann.  27-2537 (c) (1).</div><div class="casepar">Appellant alleges in enumeration 12 that the forceful argument of counsel which he alleges caused a spectator to faint (enumeration 10) and the comment by a juror concerning the demeanor of Appellant (enumeration 11) resulted in the sentence of death being imposed under the influence of passion and prejudice. We do not so find.</div><div class="casepar">He also alleges in enumeration 33 that the District Attorney's argument to the jury at the sentencing stage which included quotations concerning the death penalty from an old Georgia case, caused the sentence of death to be imposed under the influence of passion and prejudice.</div><div class="casepar">Our study of that portion of the District Attorney's argument shows that the judge referred to, the case, and the outcome, were all unidentified. The quotation was of minimal significance and enumeration 33 contains no merit. Ruffin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../884/7/index.html">243 Ga. 95 (1979)</a></span> and cits.</div><div class="casepar">We conclude that the sentences of death imposed here were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</div><div class="casepar">Our second consideration is:</div><div class="casepar">"Whether, in cases other than treason or aircraft hijacking, the evidence supports the jury's or judge's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in Section 27-2534.1 (b)." Code Ann.  27-2537 (c) (2).</div><div class="casepar">The statutory aggravating circumstance found by the jury as to each murder was "the offense of murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman." Code Ann.  27-2534.1 (b) (7).</div><div class="casepar">The evidence supports the jury's finding of statutory aggravating circumstances, and the jury's phraseology was not objectionable. See Ruffin v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Although Appellant alleges "The Court erred in its instructions on the sentencing phase of the trial in that the instructions failed to make clear to the jury that they could recommend a life sentence even if they found evidence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and failed to inform the jury that they were authorized to consider mitigating circumstances" we find that the court defined mitigating circumstances and charged "In determining your verdict in this case you shall consider any mitigating circumstances which you find," as well as charging "even though you find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances you could recommend a life sentence."</div><div class="casepar">The charge of the trial court complies with the requirements laid own in Fleming v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../966/3/index.html">240 Ga. 142 (240 SE2d 37) (1977)</a></span>; Hawes v. State, <span class="casemissing">240 Ga. 327</span>, 334 (<span class="casemissing">240 SE2d 833</span>) (1977) and Spivey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">241 Ga. 477</a></span>, 479 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">246 SE2d 288</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">The verdict is factually substantiated.</div><div class="casepar">Our final consideration is: "Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant." Code Ann.  27-2537 (c) (3).</div><div class="casepar">In reviewing the death penalty in this case, we have considered the cases appealed to this court since January 1, 1970, in which a death or life sentence was imposed and we find the similar cases listed in the Appendix support the affirmance of the death penalty in this case. Robert Franklin Godfrey's sentence to death is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases considering both the crime and the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">APPENDIX.
