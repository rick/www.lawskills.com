Also, said executrices, hereinafter named, shall in determining and arriving at the said 'one-half' interest given, bequeathed and devised to my said wife take into consideration all proceeds from life insurance, which qualify as a part of the marital deduction, on my life, owned by me at the time of my death and payable directly to my said wife.</div><div class="casepar">ITEM SIX "I give, bequeath and devise all the rest, remainder and residue of my property and estate of every kind and character, real, personal, mixed, tangible, intangible, reversionary and otherwise, wheresoever located, including all lapsed and void legacies or devises and including all property over which I have the power of appointment or disposition, to my sisters, Mrs. Merle Gibson McWhirter and Mrs. Grace Gibson Sherman, to be theirs, share and share alike, absolutely in fee simple."</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Merle Gibson McWhirter, individually and as co-executrix, and Mrs. Grace Gibson Sherman, sisters of the deceased, instituted an action thereafter against the widow, Mrs. Frances Lummus Gibson, individually and as co-executrix, seeking to cancel certain conveyances made in settlement of the estate.

Gibson, deceased, is clear and unambiguous and parol or extrinsic evidence of the testator's intent is inadmissible;</div><div class="casepar">"(d) There is no provision in the will intended by the testator to be in lieu of year's support for the widow."</div><div class="casepar">The widow appeals the foregoing order, asserting error on (1) the construction placed on the will, (2) the determination that Code  113-821 has no application, (3) the denial of a motion for summary judgment, and (4) the denial of a motion for a hearing on defenses and judgment On the pleadings.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. Inasmuch as Division 3 of this opinion, infra, supports a judgment of affirmance, no ruling is made or required on any issue of whether the appeal is subject to dismissal as premature or not involving a properly certified interlocutory order. See City of Hawkinsville v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">185 Ga. 396 (1) (195 SE 162)</span>; Littlegreen v. Gardner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../192/71/index.html">208 Ga. 523 (1) (67 SE2d 713)</a></span>; Hunter v.

Thibadeau, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../620/57/index.html">122 Ga. App. 334 (2) (177 SE2d 127)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is unnecessary to consider the third and fourth enumerations, the appellant having conceded by brief that the only issue for determination is the construction of the will.</div><div class="casepar">3. In determining whether the trial judge properly construed the will we note at the outset that the appellant and the appellees are in agreement in their briefs that the trial judge properly ruled that the terms of the will are clear and unambiguous, and that the will should be construed without reference to parol or extrinsic evidence. We agree with this position. This leaves as the controlling issue resolution of the contention of the appellant that the trial judge misconstrued the will, in that the testator intended that his widow should receive one-half of the gross estate under Item Five without deduction for the payment of debts as provided in Item Two or the specific legacies in Items Three and Four.</div><div class="casepar">In an early case Judge Lumpkin stated: "Here, then, I repeat, are parts of the instrument which, if they stood alone, would seem clearly to sustain either construction which is sought to be put upon it. It becomes our duty then, to seek, through the whole paper, for the testator's intention, and to carry that intention into effect, provided it can be done without violating any rule of law. And I will here take occasion to remark, that [it] is in vain to look at the books for precedents to aid us in arriving at a correct conclusion as to the intention of the testator. This duty must be performed by every court for itself, in each particular case." Cook v. Weaver, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. 47</span>, 50. "The intention of the testator must govern the construction of his will, if legal; and this intention may be conclusively shown by the unambiguous words of his will." Hertz v. Abrahams, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 707</span>, 708 (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 409</span>, 50 LRA 361). "Precedents or decisions of other courts are of but little value and of dangerous application in the determination of the testator's intent in a particular will." Hungerford v. Trust Co. of Ga., <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 387</span>, 389 (<span class="casemissing">9 SE2d 630</span>). "In construing the provisions of an item of a will, the whole instrument should be examined . . . [T]he intention of the testator is the controlling consideration and his intention must be ascertained by taking the will, as it is said, 'by the four corners,' and giving to all parts of it consideration." Yerbey v. Chandler, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 263</span>, 265 (<span class="casemissing">21 SE2d 636</span>). Viewing the whole of a will a later provision will prevail over an earlier provision only if the two provisions are irreconcilable. Rigdon v. Cooper, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 547 (47 SE2d 633)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">We think it is clear that the testator, in providing for disposition of the residuum to his sisters in Item Six had already "otherwise directed" the payment of his debts under the provisions of Item Two, thereby excluding application of the provisions of Code Ann.  113-821 for payment out of the residuum unless otherwise directed. Viewing Items Two through Six together we find nothing irreconcilable in respect to any later provision over any earlier provision. By Item Two, having already provided for his burial in Item One, he made clear that in settling and disposing of his estate he wanted all debts paid "as soon as practical, consistent with the best interest of his estate," and then proceeded to define "debts" in the broadest possible language, first specifically to include all manner of usual and ordinary debts and expenses pertaining to the settlement of an estate, and then generally with a "catch-all" provision for "all other debts of every kind and character due by me at the time of my death or by my estate." About the only thing he did not do, if there were a need, was to state specifically that his debts were to be paid from his gross estate and not from the residuum, but this would, in our opinion, be stating the obvious, for the statute, supra, provides that debts are paid out of the residuum unless otherwise directed. If he intended for his debts to be paid out of the residuum, then Item Two is wholly unnecessary and could have been omitted from the will.</div><div class="casepar">Further viewing the whole, i.e., Items Two through Six, we think it is clear that the testator directed his co-executrices to pay his debts as the first order of business in disposing of his estate, recognizing and protecting, of course, the specific legacies in Items Three and Four, leaving for distribution under Item Five one-half of all remaining property to his widow, but only to the extent that the property would qualify as a marital deduction under federal law, the remaining one-half to be distributed to his two sisters under Item Six. In brief, as we view the will, and as construed by the trial judge, the widow under Item Five and the two sisters together under Item Six are to receive equal shares of the estate, provided everything the widow receives thereunder qualifies for a marital deduction.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
