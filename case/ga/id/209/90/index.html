Chatham State Court. Before Judge Ginsberg.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The common law doctrine of informed consent provides that physicians and dentists have a duty to inform patients of the known material risks of a proposed treatment or procedure and to inform patients of available treatment alternatives. All of the states except Georgia now recognize the informed consent doctrine.<span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Since this court's 1975 decision in Young v. Yarn, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Georgia has not recognized any duty on the part of medical professionals to advise their patients of the known material risks of a proposed treatment or procedure nor any duty to advise of the availability of reasonable alternative treatments, thus implicitly rejecting the common law doctrine of informed consent. Because Young v. Yarn was wrongly decided, because physicians and dentists have adopted the doctrine of informed consent into their own professional ethical standards, and because of developments in Georgia law since Young v. Yarn was decided, we now overrule that decision and all the cases which have followed it. Henceforth the law of this state, like that of the other 49 states, will recognize the common law doctrine of informed consent.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. A. J. Howard examined Joseph Ketchup and told him that he needed a root canal on one of his molars. The procedure was scheduled for a later date. Ketchup returned to Dr. Howard's office on that date for the root canal procedure. Dr. Howard, without ever informing Ketchup of any risks involved with the procedure or of any alternative treatments, then performed the root canal.</div><div class="casepar">Since his root canal, Ketchup has experienced continuous numbness of his lower lip, chin, and gum on the side where the root canal was performed. An endodontist and a neurologist have examined Ketchup and have concluded that the numbness is the result of dental neuropathy, caused by damage to a nerve during the root canal procedure. The nerve injury apparently is permanent.</div><div class="casepar">Ketchup sued Dr. Howard for dental malpractice, alleging that Dr. Howard (1) negligently injected anesthetic agents while performing the root canal; (2) used improper materials to perform the root canal; and (3) failed to inform Ketchup of the risk of nerve damage resulting from the root canal. Dr. Howard moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted his motion.</div><div class="casepar">Ketchup appeals, contending the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that portion of his claim based upon Dr. Howard's failure to inform him of the risks of the procedure. While we conclude that Young v. Yarn wrongly declared that there is no duty to inform patients of the known material risks of a proposed course of treatment and must be overruled, we further hold that Georgia's recognition of the informed consent doctrine must apply prospectively. We therefore are constrained to affirm the trial court's summary judgment ruling based on the law as it existed at the time of that ruling.</div><div class="casepar">1. The court in Young v. Yarn construed only that part of the Georgia Medical Consent Law, Code  88-2906, now OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span>, which provides:</div><div class="casepar">A consent to surgical or medical treatment which discloses in general terms the treatment or course of treatment in connection with which it is given and which is duly evidenced in writing and signed by the patient or other person or persons authorized to consent pursuant to the terms of this chapter shall be conclusively presumed to be a valid consent in the absence of fraudulent misrepresentations of material facts in obtaining the same.</div><div class="casepar">In construing this language, the Young court found that a physician's duty to inform the patient of the proposed treatment in general terms does not include a duty to disclose the risks of treatment. Thus, the court held, a patient cannot sustain an action based on a doctor's failure to warn of the risks of treatment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> We conclude that the court wrongly decided the case because it erroneously applied well-settled rules of statutory construction, and it did not consider the ramifications of certain constitutionally protected liberty interests.</div><div class="casepar">(a) In order to understand precisely how this court misapplied the rules of statutory construction, it is important to remember that "consent" in the medical sense involves two distinct legal principles, both derived from common law doctrine. The first principle involves "basic" consent, meaning that consent which avoids a battery, i.e., the consent to a "touching." As Justice Cardozo observed while sitting on the Court of Appeals in New York, "Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent[ ] commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> In other words, a medical "touching" without consent is like any other touching without consent: it constitutes the intentional tort of battery for which an action will lie.</div><div class="casepar">The second principle of consent in the medical context is "informed" consent, which addresses the autonomy of a competent patient to determine what medical treatment he will allow or refuse. As Justice Rehnquist noted in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span>discussed later in this opinion, the United States Supreme Court observed as far back as 1891 that " 'no right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law' " than an individual's right to possession and control of his own person free from restraint, a notion of bodily integrity embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment. Informed consent essentially involves a medical professional fully informing a patient of the risks of and alternatives to the proposed treatment so that the patient's right to decide is not diminished by a lack of relevant information. We must consider these two principles of consent when considering what this court in Young v. Yarn held in interpreting Georgia's Medical Consent Law.</div><div class="casepar">Roscoe Pound eloquently described the judge's task in interpreting a statute when he pointed out that the object of interpretation is to discover the rule which the lawmaker intended to establish or the intent with which the lawmaker made the rule. That is to say, to discover the sense which the lawmaker attached to the words so that others could derive from the words the same meaning the lawmaker intended to convey. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> Ordinarily one accomplishes this, in the judicial sense, by looking at the literal meaning of the words used and the context in which the words are employed.</div><div class="casepar">By looking to the plain language of that portion of the 1971 Georgia Medical Consent Law which the Young v. Yarn decision addressed, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> in the context of the whole statute, it is apparent that the legislature intended to address only the "basic" consent which avoids a battery action, and not "informed" consent. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Parts of the statute which were not even mentioned by the court in the Young v. Yarn decision <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> provide the context in which the legislation is to be understood. These sections address matters such as who can consent to medical treatment and under what circumstances, what happens when an emergency exists and no authorized person is available to allow the necessary treatment to be performed, and how many persons are required to give the needed consent. In this context, which looks to the entire statute rather than an isolated sentence, it is apparent that in providing that a signed form in which the patient consents to a treatment or procedure which had been explained in general terms is conclusively valid consent, the legislature plainly addressed only basic consent.</div><div class="casepar">The concept of informed consent is not mentioned or addressed by the statute. Certainly the statute does not state expressly or even imply that informed consent is not recognized in Georgia. In the absence of plain language to that effect, the court in Young v. Yarn went beyond the legislative intent in concluding that an action based on lack of informed consent will not lie in Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, on the question of whether this court correctly interpreted the statute, we find the analysis of the Young v. Yarn opinion in a Mercer Law Review article <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> published less than a year after the decision compelling. The Young v. Yarn decision relied heavily on a Black's Law Dictionary definition of "treatment," rather than on the terms "consent" and "disclosure," which are also used in the statute. As this article points out, had the analysis turned upon the definition of either of those terms, it seems likely the court would have recognized the doctrine of informed consent like every other jurisdiction in the country. "One cannot consent to that of which he is not aware; it follows then that the patients cannot be held to have consented to the risks of surgery if they are not informed of these risks." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Moreover, a 1985 bar journal article <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> noted correctly that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span> contains no reference whatsoever to the common law doctrine of informed consent and that "a literal reading of the statute by any informed student of tort law would lead one to conclude that it relates only to basic consent in terms of potential actions for assault and battery" And while the statute itself provides that it is to be liberally construed, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> even liberal construction would not require or permit an interpretation which had the effect of eliminating an accepted common law doctrine that the statute did not even mention.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, this court has held that this statute is indeed in derogation of the common law. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> Therefore, the ordinary rules of statutory construction would require that the statute be strictly construed. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> Had that well-settled principle of statutory construction been applied in Young v. Yarn, the correct result would have been to limit the breadth of the statute to a codification of the law of basic consent, particularly in the absence of any language indicating a legislative intent to abrogate the "universally recognized" <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span> doctrine of informed consent.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Even if the legislature had intended to abolish the doctrine of informed consent by enacting OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span>, it seems likely that the statute would have been declared unconstitutional had its impact on the Constitutionally protected liberty interests discussed below been considered. Perhaps because Zant v. Prevatte, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> State of Ga. v. McAfee, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span>and Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source19" href="#note19">19</a></span>had not yet been decided, the question of the statute's constitutionality was neither raised nor addressed in the Young v. Yarn decision.</div><div class="casepar">In two of these cases, decided after Young v. Yarn, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that all persons have a liberty interest, protected by the Georgia Constitution, to make all decisions regarding their medical care, so long as they are legally competent. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span> This constitutionally protected liberty interest includes the right to refuse all medical treatment, even where the treatment is necessary to save the patient's life. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In Cruzan, the United States Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution protects that identical liberty interest. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source22" href="#note22">22</a></span> A competent person has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in refusing unwanted medical treatment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source23" href="#note23">23</a></span></div><div class="casepar">As the Supreme Court noted in Cruzan, the common law doctrine of informed consent is a corollary to this constitutionally protected liberty interest and is firmly reflected in these constitutionally protected rights. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source24" href="#note24">24</a></span> Though this court observed in Young v. Yarn that "[t]he Georgia courts have never decided whether this doctrine is applicable in this state," <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span> it nevertheless effectively denied Georgians the benefit of the doctrine of informed consent by its decision. It seems clear that, in the absence of the common law doctrine of informed consent, the constitutionally protected liberty interests that individuals enjoy to make all decisions regarding their medical treatment is rendered meaningless.</div><div class="casepar">It has been credibly argued that this court's decision in Young v. Yarn effectively and inappropriately placed the real right to make treatment decisions completely with the patient's physician. A physician with that right could, for example, induce or encourage a patient to undergo a risky yet unnecessary surgery without making known either the attendant risks or available alternatives. This would leave the uninformed patient without a remedy, even if the procedure resulted in death or disfigurement, unless the physician negligently performed the surgery. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source26" href="#note26">26</a></span> Contrary to the holding in Young v. Yarn, the law in Georgia cannot leave such a patient with no recourse. Rather, we hold that a medical professional in Georgia, including a dentist, must inform a patient of the material risks of a proposed treatment or procedure which are or should be known, and they must inform a patient of available alternatives to the proposed procedure or treatment. The holding in Young v. Yarn to the contrary is hereby overruled.</div><div class="casepar">2. Courts define and apply the legal duties professionals have to their patients and clients, but do not attempt to define standards of care. The recognized legal duty a medical professional owes to his or her patient is to exercise that degree of skill and care ordinarily employed by members of the same medical profession under the same or substantially similar circumstances. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source27" href="#note27">27</a></span> What that required level of skill and care actually is in any given case is a question of the standard of care recognized by the medical profession generally and must be proven through expert testimony. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source28" href="#note28">28</a></span></div><div class="casepar">As interpreted by this court in Young v. Yarn and its progeny, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span> effectively substitutes the judgment of this court for that of the medical profession as to the standard of care on the issue of informed consent. To understand this, one needs only look at the ethical standards adopted by the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association, which stand in stark contrast to the rule announced in Young v. Yarn.</div><div class="casepar">The first AMA Code of Medical Ethics was written in 1847. Section 1 of the 1998-1999 edition, entitled Fundamental Elements of the Patient-Physician Relationship, provides "[t]he patient has the right to receive information from physicians and to discuss the benefits, risks, and costs of appropriate treatment alternatives." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source29" href="#note29">29</a></span> And Section 8.08 of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, entitled Informed Consent, provides "[t]he patient's right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an intelligent choice." Because the AMA is an organization composed of experts in the field of medicine, its code of ethics and the duties of physicians prescribed therein should be understood to reflect the standard of care of the profession on the issue of informed consent. We are not the first court to recognize that the Code of Medical Ethics sets forth the medical profession's standard on informed consent. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source30" href="#note30">30</a></span> The Supreme Court of Indiana, citing the 1992 version of the Code of Medical Ethics, said:</div><div class="casepar">The 1992 Code of Medical Ethics, as prepared by the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association, sets forth the medical profession's standard on informed consent. It reads as follows: "The patient's right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an intelligent choice. The patient should make his own determination on treatment. The physician's obligation is to present the medical facts accurately to the patient or to the individual responsible for his care and to make recommendations for management in accordance with good medical practice. The physician has an ethical obligation to help the patient make choices from among the therapeutic alternatives consistent with good medical practice. Informed consent is a basic social policy for which exceptions are permitted (1) where the patient is unconscious or otherwise incapable of consenting and harm from failure to treat is imminent; or (2) when risk-disclosure poses such a serious psychological threat of detriment to the patient as to be medically contraindicated. Social policy does not accept the paternalistic view that the physician may remain silent because divulgence might prompt the patient to forego needed therapy.</div><div class="casepar">Rational, informed patients should not be expected to act uniformly, even under similar circumstances, in agreeing to or refusing treatment." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source31" href="#note31">31</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Similar language in the ADA Code of Ethics also reflects the standard of care for the dental profession. Part III, Section 1 of the American Dental Association Code of Ethics, entitled Principle: Patient Autonomy, provides "she dentist has a duty to respect the patient's rights to self-determination and confidentiality," and Section 1A provides "[t]he dentist should inform the patient of the proposed treatment, and any reasonable alternatives, in a manner that allows the patient to become involved in treatment decisions."</div><div class="casepar">These AMA and ADA ethical standards embrace the doctrine of informed consent, as does the law in all 49 of Georgia's sister states. Yet in decisions such as Hyles v. Cockrill <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source32" href="#note32">32</a></span>and Padgett v. Ferrier, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source33" href="#note33">33</a></span>which apply the holding in Young v. Yarn, this court has held inadmissible expert testimony that failure of a medical professional to inform a patient of the risks of a proposed treatment and/or reasonable available alternatives is a breach of the standard of care. That this court, in order to uphold Young v. Yarn, was required to rule that such expert testimony on the critical issue of standard of care is irrelevant and inadmissible is strong evidence that the original decision was wrong, especially in view of the ethical standards of the medical and dental professions discussed above. These decisions ignored the well-settled principle that the standard of care is determined by the medical profession, not by the courts. These decisions are also overruled.</div><div class="casepar">3. Subsequent to the Young v. Yarn decision, the legislature enacted OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span>, which requires medical professionals to provide information to their patients concerning the risks of some, but not all, medical procedures. That Code section is limited to surgical procedures performed under general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or major regional anesthesia, diagnostic amniocentesis, and diagnostic procedures which involve intravenous or intraductal injection of contrast material. Because the legislature is presumed to act with full knowledge of the existing state of the law, the enactment of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span>, a limited form of informed consent, can be seen as expanding the applicability of the doctrine of informed consent in Georgia from its status immediately following the Young v. Yarn decision. Because we have concluded that the Young v. Yarn case was wrongly decided, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span> cannot be said to have any limiting effect on the recognition of the common law doctrine of informed consent which we announce in this case.</div><div class="casepar">In fact, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span> is helpful in determining the standard by which to measure the duty on the part of a physician or dentist to inform his or her patient of risks inherent in proposed medical treatment. There are two major standards being applied in Georgia's sister states. One is the professional medical standard, sometimes referred to as the traditional standard. The other is the lay standard, sometimes referred to as either the materiality of risk or prudent patient standard. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source34" href="#note34">34</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Under the professional standard, the physician is required to disclose those risks which a reasonable and prudent medical practitioner would disclose under the same or similar circumstances. In most cases, the questions of whether and to what extent a physician or dentist has a duty to disclose a particular risk must be determined through expert testimony which establishes the standard of care on the issue and she physician's or dentist's departure from that standard. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source35" href="#note35">35</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In contrast, under the lay standard the physician's disclosure duty is to be measured by the patient's need for information rather than by the standards of the medical profession. While expert testimony would be required to establish that the risk which allegedly caused the injury is one which is known or should be known, the lay standard would not ordinarily require expert testimony regarding medical standards to establish the physician's duty to disclose; rather, it is for the jury to determine whether a reasonable person in the patient's position would have considered the risk significant in making the decision to have or reject the proposed treatment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source36" href="#note36">36</a></span></div><div class="casepar">As the South Carolina Court of Appeals pointed out in Hook v. Rothstein, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source37" href="#note37">37</a></span>the greater number of states in this country follow the professional standard, though almost as many states adhere to the lay standard. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source38" href="#note38">38</a></span> In Georgia, the legislature has spoken to the standard which we will apply here, the patient standard.</div><div class="casepar">Though OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span> is a limited codification of the common law doctrine of informed consent as previously discussed, it expresses a clear adoption of the patient standard, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source39" href="#note39">39</a></span> which requires disclosure of the material risks generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians which, if disclosed to a reasonably prudent person in the patient's position, could reasonably be expected to cause that person to decline the proposed treatment or procedure because of the risk of injury that could result. Thus, as to the treatments and procedures covered by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span>, the statute's language makes it clear that expert testimony would be required to establish that the particular risk either was known or should be known, but expert testimony would not be required to establish that the patient's decision to either have or reject the proposed treatment because of the risk would have been affected. The jury would, as in general tort cases, be asked to determine whether an ordinary, reasonable, and prudent person in the patient's position would have rejected the proposed treatment or procedure using lay standards. We believe this to be the better rule, and, in any event, it is obviously the one the legislature favors. Therefore, we will apply it in informed consent cases generally.</div><div class="casepar">4. Courts rightly have a preference for following precedent and adhering to the doctrine of stare decisis, but obviously must be willing to overrule prior decisions when necessary. As Chief Justice Benham noted in his dissent in Etkind v. Suarez,  <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source40" href="#note40">40</a></span></div><div class="casepar">[t]he rule of stare decisis is a wholesome one, but should not be used to sanctify and perpetuate error. We deprecate and distrust rash innovation as much as the most conservative magistrates ought, but it has never been the doctrine of any court of last resort that the law is to be a refuge and safe asylum for all the errors that creep into it. Courts, like individuals, but with more caution and deliberation, must sometimes reconsider what has been already carefully considered, and rectify their own mistakes. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source41" href="#note41">41</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The overruling of previous decisions raises many theoretical issues, one of which is the application of the new rule to other cases. Having decided to overrule the Young v. Yarn decision and its progeny, we must now decide the breadth of application of the new decision. There are four possibilities: full retroactive application; partial retroactive application; partial prospective application; and pure prospective application. The choice of which to employ turns upon whether the defendant, and those in the same position, justifiably relied upon the existing rule of law. The issue of justified reliance turns upon the question of whether any increased exposure to liability resulting from the change in the law harms a defendant who could have avoided the liability had he or she known about the rule.</div><div class="casepar">The overruling of the precedent may bring about a much needed change in the law, but the attendant retroactive feature produces evils which often, in immediate effect, outweigh the advantages attained. Uncertainty in the law results [from full retroactive application]. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source42" href="#note42">42</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Prospective application provides a solution to these problems. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source43" href="#note43">43</a></span> Because medical and dental professionals in Georgia have operated under the principle announced in Young v. Yarn and its progeny for a quarter of a century, we conclude that they are entitled to rely upon it until the publication of this opinion. In other words, justice, under the circumstances of this decision, requires us to adopt a purely prospective application of the principles announced herein.</div><div class="casepar">Consequently, the prospective application of this ruling will not affect the instant case. Even though it is undisputed that Dr. Howard did not inform Ketchup of the risk of dental neuropathy prior to performing the root canal procedure, because Georgia law did not then recognize any such duty upon dentists to warn patients of such risks or of available alternatives, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source44" href="#note44">44</a></span> Dr. Howard cannot be held liable for his failure to warn. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source45" href="#note45">45</a></span> The trial court therefore did not err in granting Dr. Howard summary judgment on this issue.</div><div class="casepar">5. Contrary to the position taken by the special concurrence, the Supreme Court of Georgia has never held that the principle announced in Young v. Yarn was correct.</div><div class="casepar">In Robinson v. Parrish, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source46" href="#note46">46</a></span>one of the two Supreme Court cases the special concurrence cites as holding that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span> establishes that there is no duty in Georgia to disclose the risks of medical treatment, the Supreme Court was addressing a certified question from the federal appeals court regarding the Georgia Voluntary Sterilization Act, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/20/2/index.html">31-20-2</a></span>. The only question addressed by the Supreme Court was whether the Voluntary Sterilization Act requires a physician to disclose possible risks associated with a sterilization procedure before the patient could validly consent to the procedure. Although the Court referred to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span> and Young v. Yarn in the opinion, it did not rely on either in reaching its decision. In fact, the Court stated that the Georgia Medical Consent Law (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span>), which Young v. Yarn interpreted, did not apply because it specifically excluded sterilization procedures. The Court noted that sterilization procedures were to be governed by the terms of the Voluntary Sterilization Act, then went on to interpret the meaning of that Act, not the statute at issue in this case.</div><div class="casepar">In Albany Urology Clinic v. Cleveland, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source47" href="#note47">47</a></span>the issue was not whether, as the special concurrence says, a failure to disclose the risks of a medical procedure would support a claim for medical negligence. Instead, the issue was whether a physician had a duty to disclose to his patients factors of his life, namely his drug use, which might adversely affect the physician's performance. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source48" href="#note48">48</a></span> Even though the Court cited Young v. Yarn, it did not decide the issue of whether a physician has a common law duty to disclose the risks associated with a particular medical treatment or procedure. In fact, Albany Urology dealt specifically with the applicability of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6.1/index.html">31-9-6.1</a></span>, requiring informed consent in cases involving surgery performed while a patient is under general anesthesia. While reasonable minds may differ as to whether the language in Albany Urology presents an obstacle to this court correcting its own error in Young v. Yarn and its progeny, there is little room for disagreement that the mention of the common law principle of informed consent in both Supreme Court cases was dicta. Since the Supreme Court's use or mention of our cases was merely dicta, we believe this court is within its authority to overrule the cases we decided which changed the common law principle of informed consent in this state.</div><div class="casepar">6. Finally, in his brief, Ketchup argues that Dr. Howard failed to inform him of the general nature of the root canal procedure and, therefore, violated OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span>, which sets out the requirements for establishing valid consent to a procedure. However, Ketchup's complaint does not allege that Dr. Howard failed to inform him of the general nature of a root canal procedure or that Dr. Howard did not have Ketchup's consent to perform the root canal procedure. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source49" href="#note49">49</a></span> And Ketchup never amended his complaint to include an allegation of lack of basic consent. The evidence is undisputed that Ketchup was told during one visit that he needed the procedure and that he scheduled an appointment to have the procedure done at a later time, then returned to Dr. Howard's office and submitted to the procedure. This conclusively establishes basic consent, which, as we have held herein, is all OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/31/9/6/index.html">31-9-6</a></span> addresses.</div><div class="casepar">Rather, Ketchup sued Dr. Howard for dental malpractice, claiming that Dr. Howard breached the standard of care in performing the root canal and in failing to advise him of potential complications of the root canal. Insofar as the brief and enumeration of error attempt to broaden the allegations in Ketchup's complaint to include an allegation that Dr. Howard failed to inform Ketchup of the general nature of the root canal procedure and therefore did not have Ketchup's consent to perform the root canal procedure, the attempt is impermissible. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source50" href="#note50">50</a></span> Since this claim was neither alleged in Ketchup's complaint, supported by any evidence, nor raised in the trial court, we will not consider it here. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source51" href="#note51">51</a></span></div><div class="casepar">APPENDIX.</div><div class="casepar">1.

Hawaii: HRS  671-3 creates a statutory medical tort for the rendering of professional services without informed consent. However, this statute does not apply to dentists.

Ditto v. McCurdy, 86 Haw. 84 (947 P2d 952, 958) (1997). After determining through expert testimony whether the risk was material, the focus is on what a reasonable person, with all the characteristics of the patient (including his idiosyncracies and religious beliefs), would need to hear to allow him to make an informed and intelligent decision regarding proposed medical treatment.

In analyzing this issue, however, the Court extensively discussed the state of the law governing the doctrine of informed consent. The Court expressly stated that</div><div class="casepar">[p]rior to 1988, Georgia physicians were not required to disclose to their patients any of the risks associated with a particular medical treatment or procedure. . . . As established by pre-1988 precedent, under the common law, evidence of a failure to reveal the risks associated with medical treatment is not even admissible in support of a claim for professional negligence.

Indeed, the majority makes no attempt to reconcile its decision with the plain language of the Supreme Court's decision. Instead, the majority simply ignores such language, apparently on the grounds that it is dicta.</div><div class="casepar">In my opinion, when the Supreme Court has clearly and unambiguously spoken on an issue, this Court should be extremely reluctant to dismiss such pronouncements as mere dicta. Even if I were inclined to treat Supreme Court statements as dicta, however, I would not do so in this case, as it is apparent that the Court's discussion of informed consent in Albany Urology Clinic was central to its analysis. Indeed, immediately after the extensive discussion quoted above, the Supreme Court stated that "[i]t follows that" the physician in question had no statutory or common law duty to disclose his drug use to his patient. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source55" href="#note55">55</a></span> Although the majority treats the Court's analysis as mere dicta, it is apparent that the Supreme Court considered such analysis to be central to its decision.
