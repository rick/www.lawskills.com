Because the trial court properly applied the provisions of the statute and did not err in dismissing the complaint as to three of the defendants below, we affirm. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Daniel A. Metzler brought this tort action in DeKalb County Superior Court against Atlanta City Council member Cathy Woolard, local residents Helen Loyless, Steven Rowell, and Rochelle Routman, and Wildwood Urban Forest Group ("Wildwood"). Most of the relevant facts are not disputed by the parties. Metzler owns approximately 31 acres of land in the Morningside neighborhood, located in the City of Atlanta and Fulton County. He filed a petition seeking to rezone the property to allow the construction of 34 houses on approximately nine acres. This zoning petition was opposed by numerous individuals from the community as well as by Wildwood, which the trial court described as "an unincorporated grass-roots environmental organization."</div><div class="casepar">Metzler's zoning request was denied, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> and Metzler appealed that decision to the Fulton County Superior Court in March 1999. Numerous individuals from the neighborhood, including the appellees in this case, filed a motion to intervene in the Fulton Superior Court action in June 1999. That motion was denied in December 1999. The Fulton County zoning appeal remained pending at the time of the DeKalb County trial court's order in this case.</div><div class="casepar">In August 1999, Metzler entered into a contract with D. R. Horton, Inc. -- Torrey ("Torrey") for Torrey to purchase and develop the land. Under the contract, Torrey had a period of 45 days within which it could, at its option, terminate and void the agreement by written notice to Metzler. During this period, Torrey had the right to enter on and inspect the land and perform various studies, including soil borings and percolation tests. During the week of September 20, 1999, Metzler alleges that Torrey attempted to perform a soil boring test. A concerned individual in the neighborhood called the police, apparently believing that the use of heavy equipment indicated that development had begun without a permit. Metzler alleges that "[d]efendants Woolard or Loyless or an unidentified third party believed to be a member, agent, or actor on behalf of" Wildwood made the telephone call; appellees Routman and Rowell deny having done so.</div><div class="casepar">On September 24, 1999, an attorney representing "a number of the Morningside residents whose property adjoins or is downstream of the Dan Metzler/Torrey property" wrote a letter to Metzler's attorneys and Torrey. He noted that heavy equipment had been used to disturb the land for several days without a permit, including areas in the wetlands on the site and a state-mandated 25-foot stream buffer zone. He advised Metzler and Torrey that "all such activities must be terminated immediately" and that his clients otherwise would seek injunctive relief, and he asked that Metzler and Torrey call him at their earliest convenience to inform him of their intentions. Metzler also alleges that city council member Woolard contacted the Torrey vice president for acquisitions, told him that the property was the subject of a lawsuit and that the City of Atlanta would oppose any effort to develop the land, and asked to be informed of its decision. On September 28, 1999, Torrey notified Metzler that it would not purchase the land.</div><div class="casepar">Metzler then brought this DeKalb County action against Woolard as well as Loyless, Rowell, Routman, and Wildwood, alleging tortious interference with the sales option contract with Torrey, tortious interference with business relations, trespass, and interference with his right of quiet enjoyment of his property. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> He sought punitive damages and injunctive relief.</div><div class="casepar">Rowell and Routman immediately filed a motion to dismiss on numerous grounds, including the provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span>, and Wildwood joined them in amended motions to dismiss, a motion for protective order, and a motion to quash. The trial court determined that Metzler's action violated OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span>. The trial court also found Metzler's remaining claims to be without merit and that Wildwood was never properly served. This appeal followed.</div><div class="casepar">1. Metzler contends that the trial court erred in finding that his action was a "SLAPP suit" under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span>. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> is intended to protect Georgia citizens who participate in "matters of public significance through the exercise of their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and the right to petition government for redress of grievances" from "abuse of the judicial process." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (a). To prevent such abuse, the statute provides that a claim that could reasonably be construed as infringing upon these rights must be accompanied by a detailed verification and provides for a motion to dismiss and hearing on this issue. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (b). See generally Providence Constr. Co. v. Bauer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/52/index.html">229 Ga. App. 679</a></span>, 680 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/52/index.html">494 SE2d 527</a></span>) (1997) (full concurrence as to Division 1). Even if a verification is filed with the complaint, the trial court may nevertheless impose sanctions, including dismissal, "[i]f a claim is verified in violation of this Code section." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (b). The mechanical filing of a verification with the complaint, therefore, does not preclude dismissal if the claim is found by the trial court to infringe on the rights of free speech or petition as defined by the statute.</div><div class="casepar">In interpreting this statute, we first consider the expansive definition of protected speech and petition under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (c):</div><div class="casepar">As used in this Code section, "act in furtherance of the right of free speech or the right to petition government for a redress of grievances under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Georgia in connection with an issue of public interest or concern" includes any written or oral statement, writing, or petition made before or to a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, or any written or oral statement, writing, or petition made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.</div><div class="casepar">Subsection (b) of this Code section also references the privilege statute, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/5/7/index.html">51-5-7</a></span>, specifically subsection (4), and the privilege statute in its turn incorporates the free speech and petition definition set out in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (c). As established by these interlocking Code sections, the law includes two alternative definitions of a protected statement: any statement made to any "official proceeding authorized by law"; or any statement made in connection with an issue under consideration by any official proceeding. The dissent fails to take into account the scope of the latter definition.</div><div class="casepar">At the time of the acts complained of, Metzler's zoning petition had been pending for some time before the City of Atlanta, and a lawsuit was pending in Fulton Superior Court, as Metzler acknowledged in his verified complaint and the trial court noted in its order. While the zoning matter, the lawsuit, and the defendants' petition to intervene in the lawsuit were all pending, there were several "official proceedings" under way, and virtually all the conduct complained of falls within the scope of this very expansive definition. A letter written by an attorney for parties to a petition to intervene, directed to the owner of the land in litigation and a developer actually performing work on that land, is clearly made "in connection with an issue" of zoning and development under consideration by a "judicial body."</div><div class="casepar">The framing of Metzler's claims as tortious interference with contract or business relations does not render the assertion of privilege inapplicable. The statements complained of are not only privileged within the meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (c) and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/5/7/index.html">51-5-7</a></span> (4), but also under the similar "good faith statements" provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/5/7/index.html">51-5-7</a></span> (3), as the trial court noted in its order. In dismissing the action, the trial court relied in part on Choice Hotels Intl. v. Ocmulgee Fields, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/16/index.html">222 Ga. App. 185 (474 SE2d 56) (1996)</a></span>. In Choice, Ocmulgee, a hotel franchisee, claimed that the franchisor, Choice, tortiously interfered with its contractual rights. Ocmulgee's principal was involved in a long-running dispute with Choice that resulted in Ocmulgee's attempted cancellation of the franchise agreement and an attempt to contract with another hotel franchise. Choice then wrote a letter to the other franchise informing it that Ocmulgee was still under contract with Choice; it was this letter that Ocmulgee claimed constituted tortious interference. Id. at 188. We held that Choice's interest in its contract with Ocmulgee was "a valid interest that Choice was entitled to uphold" and that its letter was "made on a proper occasion, its publication was limited to those concerned, . . . and it was properly limited in scope." Id. at 188-189 (2). Similarly, the neighborhood residents in this case had a valid interest in the zoning and development of their immediate surroundings, and a letter expressing their legal position, sent through an attorney, was made on a proper occasion and limited to those concerned: Metzler and the third party holding an option on the property and performing work there.</div><div class="casepar">The privilege established by the anti-SLAPP statute was correctly applied by the trial court to the facts and circumstances set forth here, and the trial court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss.</div><div class="casepar">But we need not reach these allegations with respect to appellees here. The allegations of trespass and interference with property rights in Metzler's complaint are limited to Loyless, who is not a party to this appeal, acting "alone or in conjunction with other individuals" who are never identified. The trial court limited its dismissal on this count to Rowell, Routman, and Wildwood only. Woolard and Loyless, who are defendants below but not parties to this appeal, are alleged to be the individuals involved in the call to the police, the alleged trespass, and telephone calls to an officer of the third party. While Metzler makes a comprehensive allegation that all defendants were jointly and severally involved in each act, he gives no supporting facts, and both Rowell and Routman have explicitly denied contacting the police, contacting Torrey, or interfering with Metzler's property by touching surveyor's markers, blocking access, or making any statements to Metzler. Particularly in light of the discovery and evidentiary standards of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span>, as discussed below, Metzler was not entitled to stand on the general and conclusory allegations of his complaint in the face of direct testimony to the contrary, and the trial court did not err in dismissing the complaint as to these parties.</div><div class="casepar">3. Metzler contends that the trial court's decision should have been made on summary judgment rather than a motion to dismiss. This was not necessary, however, in light of the clear mandate contained in the anti-SLAPP statute. In OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (b) and (c), the General Assembly has established a mechanism by which the threshold question of compliance with the anti-SLAPP statute is decided on motion to dismiss or motion to strike. This is analogous to the statutory mechanism of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/12/index.html">9-11-12</a></span> (b), which provides that only motions under Rule 12 (b) (6) for failure to state a claim are converted to summary judgment. Other motions under 12 (b), such as to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or for insufficiency of process, are not subject to this statutory rule, and such a motion, even "when tried on affidavits pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/43/index.html">9-11-43</a></span> (b), does not become a motion for summary judgment." (Citations omitted.) Terrell v. Porter, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../384/15/index.html">189 Ga. App. 778</a></span>, 779-780 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../384/15/index.html">377 SE2d 540</a></span>) (1989). The application of this rule is made plain by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (d), which expressly provides that the trial court in its discretion may order limited discovery despite the stay imposed when a motion to dismiss or strike is filed pursuant to subsection (b). When the statutory scheme provides for limited discovery in conjunction with the filing of a motion to dismiss or motion to strike, the introduction of evidence produced by that discovery should not convert the motion to one for summary judgment. If Metzler wished to conduct discovery and introduce evidence to show that dismissal of his complaint as to these defendants was inappropriate despite the privilege established by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (b) and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/5/7/index.html">51-5-7</a></span>, he could have petitioned the trial court for any necessary discovery and introduced evidence in accordance with the statutory provisions.</div><div class="casepar">4. Finally, Metzler contends the trial court erred in finding that he failed to effectuate proper service upon Wildwood. The question of proper service is also a matter that can be decided on motion to dismiss even if affidavits are introduced. "Motions to dismiss for insufficiency of service of process are matters in abatement, and do not form a proper basis for motions for summary judgment or convert to motions for summary judgment when matters outside the pleadings are considered. [Cit.]" Cushman v. Raiford, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../279/44/index.html">221 Ga. App. 785</a></span>, 786 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../279/44/index.html">472 SE2d 554</a></span>) (1996). The trial court properly considered affidavits regarding the composition and organization of Wildwood. As with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span> (d), Metzler could have conducted limited discovery or deposed the defendants on this issue, but he did not do so. The only allegation is that made in the complaint: that Loyless, Rowell, and Routman are each "an official and/or member" of Wildwood, and Wildwood may be served by serving them. This general allegation was directly refuted by the affidavits of Rowell and Routman.</div><div class="casepar">Sheet Metal Workers Intl. Assn. v. Carter, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../947/7/index.html">241 Ga. 220 (244 SE2d 860) (1978)</a></span>, is not applicable here, as it does not permit service on mere "members" rather than "official members" as defined in that decision. In Carter, service was purportedly made upon the union by serving a rank-and-file member of a union local. The case holds that "official member," as set out in the applicable statute, means</div><div class="casepar">a person who is clothed with some official duty or status to perform for the association or organization, other than that imposed upon an officer; a duty or status which is also more than that imposed upon a person solely because he is listed as a member on the official rolls of the association or organization.</div><div class="casepar">Id. at 222. Metzler failed to show proper service on an "official member" of Wildwood, although he had the opportunity to do so. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> The trial court correctly determined, based upon the evidence before it, that Metzler failed to effectuate proper service upon Wildwood.</div><div class="casepar">ELDRIDGE, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent.</div><div class="casepar">The tortious conduct of the defendants had no direct relationship with either the previous rezoning application or the pending suit appealing such denial. The lawsuit alleged defendants' conduct was designed to block the private land sale, because the defendants wanted no development on plaintiff's land under any circumstances. Thus defendants' conduct was unrelated to the exempt conduct of the Anti-SLAPP Statute. The defendants' conduct was part of the overall opposition to any development of this land whether under the existing zoning, non-Anti-SLAPP protection, or a rezoning, Anti-SLAPP protection. Torrey's purchase and development of the land for houses were under the existing City of Atlanta zoning and existing state and federal environmental laws and regulation. The defendants' action was not directed as free speech or right of petition to influence the news media, the judiciary, public officials, or even the public, but such action was directed in private to a private person, Torrey, to chill the purchase by contract through harassment from the neighborhood and environmental groups and threat of costly litigation in terms of time and money. Such conduct falls outside the intent and purpose of not only the Anti-SLAPP Statute but also is not privileged conduct. This opinion constitutes an unreasonable judicial expansion of such narrowly drawn statutes contrary to the express intent of the General Assembly.</div><div class="casepar">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is the determination of the legislative intent and purpose. Where a statute is clear, plain, and unambiguous, the courts must construe the statute according to its exact terms, because the language of the statute is a clear expression of the intent of the legislature in passing such statute, and courts are prohibited from broadening its application by judicial construction.

It was a blatant attempt to stop the sale of the land for development for homes. Thus, it was private action directed to private individuals rather than governmental petition or an effort to influence government action. See Browns Mill Dev. Co. v. Denton, supra at 232-233.</div><div class="casepar">Under the complaint, the conduct involved defendants (1) calling the police to stop soil testing on plaintiff's land by Torrey; (2) defendants' counsel writing to plaintiff's counsel and Torrey threatening lawsuit if further soil or wetland disturbance occurred on the plaintiff's land; and (3) having direct contact with Torrey demanding to know if it intended to exercise its contract option to purchase plaintiff's land and to build homes on the land within the existing zoning. Plaintiff contended in its complaint that all of such conduct was intended to threaten, coerce, and intimidate Torrey with trouble, delay, and expense from community action, opposition, and threat of lawsuit so that it would chill the purchase of plaintiff's land and thereby avoid development of the land. It was alleged that this action by the defendants intentionally and maliciously chilled plaintiff's business opportunity and drove off the prospective purchaser. None of such private conduct comes within OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/11.1/index.html">9-11-11.1</a></span>, because the conduct did not involve a petition of government or free speech directed toward the influence of government action.
