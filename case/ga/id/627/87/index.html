Walker City Court. Before Judge Adams.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This case arises out of a collision between two automobiles which occurred on a paved road running generally in a north-south direction. The plaintiff-appellee's car was heading north on the northbound or east side of the road. The defendant-appellant's car was also on the north-bound or east side of the road but was stopped with the front end facing or heading south. The collision was more or less head-on. There was some evidence that part of defendant's car was on the pavement. There was other testimony that defendant's car was not on the pavement but was on the shoulder of the road.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Defendant's motion for new trial was overruled and it is from this order that the appeal was taken. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. It is enumerated as error that the trial court erred in charging, over timely exception, Code Ann.  68-1670 (a) (15) (Ga. L. 1953, Nov. Sess., pp. 556, 598, as amended), which states: "(a) No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle, except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with law or the directions of a police officer or traffic control device, in any of the following places: . . . 15. It shall be unlawful for any person to stop or park any automobile, truck, tractor, trailer, or other motor vehicle, or horse-drawn vehicle on or along any State-aid road or highway, unless such vehicle be placed so that it is at least 12 feet removed from the centerline of such State-aid road or highway; and such vehicle shall be so parked that no portion thereof shall be within 12 feet of the centerline of such State-aid road or highway."</div><div class="casepar">It is contended that the provision has regard to a "State-aid road" only and that there was no showing that the road involved was a State-aid road. There is no merit in the contention. The statute win be seen to refer to "State-aid road or highway." "Street or highway" is defined by Code Ann.  68-1504 (1) (a) (Ga. L. 1953, Nov. Sess., pp. 556, 561, as amended) as "The entire width between the boundary lines of every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel." There was sufficient evidence to bring the road involved within this classification. The words "State-aid road" are not limiting. In this connection see Code Ann.  68-1670 (c) relating to "roads and highways," and particularly see sublettered section (d) relating to "any street, road or highway of the State of Georgia."</div><div class="casepar">2. It is also contended that the trial court erred in charging subsection (a) of Code Ann.  68-1668 (Ga. L. 1953, Nov. Sess., pp. 556, 597) without also charging subsection (b) thereof, although timely exception was made.</div><div class="casepar">Subsection (a) provides, in substance, that no person shall stop or leave any vehicle on the paved part of a highway when it is practical to stop it or leave it off the paved part of the highway, and that in any event the vehicle must be located so as to leave a sufficient unobstructed width of highway for other vehicles to pass freely and the stopped vehicle must be in clear view for a distance of 200 feet in each direction.</div><div class="casepar">Subsection (b) provides that the statute does not apply if a vehicle is "disabled while on the paved or main-traveled portion of a highway in such manner and to such extent that it is impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving such disabled vehicle in such position. . ." (Emphasis supplied.) "Where the court undertakes to charge the principles contained in a code Section, he should charge all the principles involved in the Code section, if the evidence warrants it." Lancaster v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/10/index.html">83 Ga. App. 746</a></span> (4c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/10/index.html">64 SE2d 902</a></span>). The trial judge refused to charge subsection (b) as being inapplicable under the evidence. We think he was correct. All the evidence is that the car was movable, however difficult it may have been, under its own power, and was in fact moved by the defendant from its original position, i.e., where parked by his wife, to a new position, placing it at the edge of the pavement or part way on the pavement. There was no evidence that it was "impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving" the car in the latter location, or that the car was ever, at any time, impossible to move.</div><div class="casepar">JORDAN, Presiding Judge, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">I agree with the conclusion reached by the majority opinion that the trial court did not err in failing to charge paragraph (b) of Code Ann.  68-1668. In my opinion this exception applies only when a vehicle becomes disabled " while on the paved . . . portion of a highway" to the extent that it is impossible to avoid stopping or temporarily leaving the vehicle in such a position. The evidence here is clear and uncontradicted that the defendant's vehicle became disabled (emergency brake would not release) while off the highway and that the defendant moved the disabled vehicle on or near the paved portion of the high way, i.e., from a place of relative safety to one of imminent danger. Under such a state of facts, the evidence did not authorize a charge on paragraph (b) of Code Ann.  68-1668.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Judge Pannell concurs in this view.</div><div class="casepar">EVANS, Judge, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">I believe the words "State-aid roads or highways" as used in Code Ann.  68-1670 (a-15) (Ga. L. 1953, Nov. Sess. pp. 556, 598) mean State-aid roads or State-aid highways; that is, that whether it is a road or highway the law requires that it be one in the State system of "State-aid roads or highways." While the evidence in the record on this point is slight, this court may take judicial notice of the maps filed as authoritative records of the State-aid Road System as required by the General Assembly by Code  95-1608. The courts have taken judicial notice of said engineers' report and maps in Jordan v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../179/94/index.html">212 Ga. 337</a></span>, 340 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../179/94/index.html">92 SE2d 528</a></span>), and this case has been followed in Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/65/index.html">96 Ga. App. 833</a></span> (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/65/index.html">101 SE2d 747</a></span>). Thus, taking judicial notice of such map of State-aid roads, as filed in the office of Secretary of State on March 6, 1967, the road referred to by the evidence in this case at the point where the collision occurred shows same to be a part of the State-aid system (State Highway System and Connections). I concur specially in Headnote 1 and in the judgment of affirmance.</div><div class="casepar">HALL, Presiding Judge, dissenting as to Division 2.</div><div class="casepar">I think the trial court was in error in failing to charge subsection (b) of Code Ann.  68-1668. It provides as follows: "(b) This section shall not apply to the driver of any vehicle which is disabled while on the paved or main-traveled portion of a highway in such manner and to such extent that it is impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving such disabled vehicle in such position: Provided, however, the driver or person in charge of such vehicle shall cause such vehicle to be removed from the roadway as promptly as possible; . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The evidence clearly authorizes a finding that the defendant was attempting to remove a "disabled" vehicle "as promptly as possible." By charging Code Ann.  68-1668 (a), declaring parking on any part of the highway to be negligence per se, and refusing to charge Code Ann.  68-1668 (b), which declares (a) to be inapplicable where the vehicle is "disabled" and the driver is attempting to correct the disability as promptly as possible, the court in effect is creating liability without fault.</div><div class="casepar">Even more unusual is the logicalization of one special concurrence which states that where a vehicle is disabled off the highway and by some means gets partially on the highway while still disabled, it is not a "vehicle which is disabled while on the paved" highway. What then--pray tell--is it? The uncontradicted evidence shows that the disability of the vehicle and the defendant's action in attempting to remove this disability caused the vehicle to be part way on the pavement in a disabled condition. The vehicle was "disabled" when part of it came upon the highway and the defendant was attempting to alleviate the "disability" at the time of the accident.</div><div class="casepar">The question here relates to the intent of the General Assembly. In the main, its membership is that of lay men and women untouched by the fetishisticness of myopic legalisms. They intended that a person who parks on the highway is guilty of negligence per se, but made an exception where the vehicle is disabled and the driver is attempting to alleviate the disability as promptly as possible.</div><div class="casepar">This was a proper case for the jury but the defendant is entitled to have that body consider all the principles of law contained in Code Ann.  68-1668--the exception as well as the rule.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Judges Eberhardt and Deen concur in this dissent.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">FranK M.
