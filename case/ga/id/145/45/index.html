Leaptrot and Minnie G. Leaptrot, husband and wife, executed separate wills with identical provisions. They devised life estates in all their property to each other. Upon the death of the survivor, they devised their respective one-half interests in a parcel of property known as 100 Hardeman Avenue, Macon, Georgia, to the wife's brother Lawrence Self and one-half of the remaining estate to the husband's brothers and sisters and one-half to the wife's named brother.</div><div class="casepar">Items six of the wills recite: "This will is executed as a part of the same transaction by which my wife [husband] is executing her [his] will and the two wills are expressly executed as mutual wills and the provisions of this will with reference to the disposition of my property after my wife's [husband's] death shall not be operative unless her [his] will with reference to the remainder interest in her [his] property is also operative. It is the common desire of my said wife [husband] and of me that such properties as remain from both of our estates after the death of the last survivor shall pass as follows: the fee simple title to the real estate, including the building at 100 Hardeman Avenue, Macon, Georgia, to go to Lawrence Self, the brother of my said wife [my brother] and the remainder for equal division, one-half to my brothers and sisters and one-half to the said Lawrence Self [one-half to the brothers and sisters of my said husband and one-half to my said brother, Lawrence Self]."</div><div class="casepar">Items nine of the wills recite: "If for any reason one-half of the remainder interest in my wife's [husband's] estate, but excepting therefrom the property known as 100 Hardeman Avenue, Macon, Georgia, as provided in her [his] said will does not pass to my brothers and sisters [my brother], then it is my will and desire that the remainder interest in my estate shall pass to my brothers and sisters in equal shares [my brother] and to the exclusion of my wife's brother, Lawrence Self [to the exclusion of my husband's brothers and sisters]."</div><div class="casepar">Clarence A. Leaptrot died on December 27, 1948. His will was probated, and Minnie G. Leaptrot, his executrix, was discharged on June 4, 1951. On September 7, 1961, Minnie G. Leaptrot executed a new and different will in which she devised all of her property to her niece Shirley Ann Self, the daughter of Lawrence Self. Minnie G. Leaptrot died on September 12, 1968. Under Minnie G. Leaptrot's last will of September 7, 1961, the Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank of Macon (hereinafter called Bank) was appointed executor of her estate.</div><div class="casepar">Lawrence Self died testate on March 30, 1959, leaving all his property to his wife Annie Pearl Sumner Self.</div><div class="casepar">A quitclaim deed dated April 30, 1960, was given by Mrs. Annie Pearl S. Self and Shirley Ann Self to Minnie G. Leaptrot for the property located at 100 Hardeman Avenue, Macon, Georgia, the grantors therein being the widow and daughter of Lawrence Self. The property was thereafter sold by Mrs. Minnie G. Leaptrot.</div><div class="casepar">Shirley Ann Self was appointed guardian of Minnie G. Leaptrot on August 8, 1968, by the Court of Ordinary of Bibb County, Georgia, and was discharged on December 2, 1968.</div><div class="casepar">The brother and sister of Clarence A. Leaptrot and the heirs of a deceased brother and sister brought this action against the Bank, as executor of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot, as executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot, and against Shirley Ann Self. The petition sought: (1) an accounting by the defendant Bank as executor of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot, (2) an accounting by the Bank as executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot, (3) judgment against the Bank as executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot in double the value of one-half of the property and other assets belonging to the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot as disclosed by said accounting, (4) judgment against the Bank as executor of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot for one-half of the value of the remainder estate, and (5) temporary and permanent injunction against the Bank in its representative capacity and Shirley Ann Self restraining the defendants from turning over any of the assets belonging to either estate to Shirley Ann Self prior to a final determination of the issues involved in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants moved to dismiss so much of the plaintiffs' petition which seeks: (1) an accounting from the Bank as executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot, (2) judgment against the Bank as executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot in double the value of one-half of the property as disclosed by an accounting, (3) judgment against the Bank as executor of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot for one-half of the value of the remainder estate.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. "Mutual wills may be defined as the separate wills of two persons which are reciprocal in their provisions." Lampkin v. Edwards, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../153/30/index.html">222 Ga. 288</a></span>, 290 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../153/30/index.html">149 SE2d 708</a></span>). See Webb v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../160/54/index.html">220 Ga. 809 (141 SE2d 899)</a></span>; Couch v. Wood, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 626 (119 SE 691)</span>. "Mutual wills result from a mutual intention on the part of the makers thereof to make reciprocal testamentary gifts." Lampkin v. Edwards, supra. The wills in the instant case are mutual. Not only are the provisions reciprocal but the makers specifically stated their intentions that "the two wills are expressly executed as mutual wills." Mutual wills are legal in this State. Code Ann.  113-104.</div><div class="casepar">"[T]he mere execution of such wills does not impose such a legal obligation as will prevent revocation. By the weight of authority agreements to make wills are not established merely because two persons make some reciprocal testamentary dispositions in favor of each other, the language of such wills containing nothing to the effect that the instruments are the result of a contract. The case is different, however, where the mutual wills are the result of a contract based upon a valid consideration, and where, after the death of one of the parties, the survivor has accepted benefits under the will of the other which was executed pursuant to an agreement. In such cases, where all the facts are fully proved, equity will interpose to prevent fraud. This can be accomplished only through a court of equity, as the probate court has no jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. Equity, however, can deal only with the agreement, and can only interpose to prevent fraud arising from the breach of such agreement by one who has received benefits thereunder . . . However, to enable one to invoke the intervention of equity, it is not sufficient that there are wills simultaneously made, and similar in their reciprocal provisions, but the existence of a clear and definite contract must be alleged and proved, either by proof of an express agreement, or by unequivocal circumstances." Clements v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 738</span>, 742 (<span class="casemissing">144 SE 319</span>). It is the contract and not the mutual will which is irrevocable. See Code  113-401; 169 ALR 1, 25, 47.</div><div class="casepar">"From an analysis of the . . . cases upon this subject these principles are deducible: . . . (3) It is generally held that the fact that separate wills, with reciprocal provisions, have been executed by two persons simultaneously, or about the same time, is not of itself evidence of a contract between the testators, but such a contract may appear from the terms of the will by direct reference or by inference." Clements v. Jones, supra, p. 744. See Webb v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../160/54/index.html">220 Ga. 809</a></span>, supra, p. 812, stating, "The contract or agreement between the joint testators may be made out from the promises made in the will."</div><div class="casepar">The petition avers that they "had entered into an agreement whereby they had executed mutual wills." In our opinion it is clear that the testator and testatrix in the instant case entered into a contract to make mutual wills. The wills recite, "This will is executed as a part of the same transaction by which my wife [husband] is executing her [his] will and the two wills are expressly executed as mutual wills." Most of the property of the testators was owned jointly. There were no lineal heirs. The bequests of the wills divided the property upon the death of the survivor equally between their respective collateral heirs except for the specific bequest of the Hardeman Avenue property. It was a natural and rational agreement based upon mutual promises to devise their property almost equally between the brothers and sisters of the husband on the one hand and the brother of the wife on the other. "Ample consideration for a husband's promise to devise property to his wife for her life, provision to be made for a third person upon the death of the testator, is found in the promise of the wife to make a similar testamentary distribution on her part, where the proof is ample that the wife had property of her own." 169 ALR 1, 33; Webb v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../160/54/index.html">220 Ga. 809</a></span>, supra, at p. 812.</div><div class="casepar">We hold, therefore, that the mutual wills were based on a contract between Clarence A. Leaptrot and Minnie G. Leaptrot, that such contract is enforceable in equity, and that the plaintiffs here are entitled to recover thereon.</div><div class="casepar">The portions of the wills stating that, the provisions of this will with reference to the disposition of my property after my wife's [husband's] death shall not be operative unless her [his] will with reference to the remainder interest in her [his] property is also operative" do not require a different conclusion. The word "operative" means "producing an appropriate or designed effect" or "having the power of acting." Webster, Third New International Dictionary. In our opinion it is apparent that the parties were guarding against the possibility of the provisions of either will failing to effect the agreed upon disposition. They did not intend to authorize the invalidation of the entire will by a deliberate act of revocation by the survivor.</div><div class="casepar">Also, the provisions of the wills reciting that, "If for any reason one-half of the remainder interest in my wife's [husband's] estate . . . as provided in her [his] will does not pass to my brothers and sisters [my brother], then it is my will" do not require a different conclusion. Under our holding herein the remainder interest does pass and this provision has no application. The fact that the interest passes under the contract and not under the will would not alter this finding.</div><div class="casepar">Code  53-504 (effective at the time of the execution of the wills but repealed by Ga. L. 1950, p. 174) providing, "No contract of sale by a wife of her separate estate to her husband or trustee shall be valid, unless the same shall be allowed by order of the superior court of the county of her domicile" has no application here. This case does not involve a contract of sale.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in not granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment decreeing that they were entitled to one-half of the remainder estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot and one-half of the remainder estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot. The trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment on the same issues.</div><div class="casepar">2. The plaintiffs contend that the bank is an executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot under Code  113-1102. The record shows that Minnie G. Leaptrot was lawfully appointed and discharged as the executrix of the estate of her husband, Clarence A. Leaptrot. She was entitled to a life interest in the property comprising his estate. She necessarily had to possess the property to enjoy it. The evidence shows she was not acting in bad faith nor holding the property wrongfully. The bank, as executor of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot, is not an executor de son tort of the estate of Clarence A. Leaptrot. See Robbins v. Riales, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/53/index.html">113 Ga. App. 881 (150 SE2d 187)</a></span>. The trial court erred in not sustaining defendants' motion for summary judgment decreeing that the bank is not an executor de son tort and is not required to account as such for the assets of that estate. It is not necessary to rule on the motion to dismiss of the defendant on this issue since matters outside the pleadings were presented to the court and the motion is treated as one for summary judgment. See Code Ann.  81A-112 (b) (Ga. L. 1966, pp. 609, 622; 1967, pp. 226, 231). The trial court did not err in denying the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the same issues.</div><div class="casepar">3. Under our ruling in Division 1, it follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to an accounting of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot. The trial court erred in not granting their motion for summary judgment decreeing that the defendants furnish an accounting of the estate of Minnie G. Leaptrot. The trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion for summary judgment on the same issue.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part; reversed in part.
