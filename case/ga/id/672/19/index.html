Before Judge Tanksley.</div><div class="casepresiding">BELL, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The privilege of dismissal and renewal under Code  3-808 does not apply to void cases, but does apply to allow renewal where the previous action was merely voidable. Cutliffe v. Pryse, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 51</span>, 53 (1) (<span class="casemissing">200 SE 124</span>). The prior action in the present case was not void, and was, therefore, renewable.</div><div class="casepar">2. As a general rule, the question whether costs were paid in a dismissed prior action, as required under Code  3-508, can be raised only by a plea in abatement. The demurrer in the present case does not properly raise the question.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff brought this action in the Superior Court of Fulton County against defendant surety on a bond issued by the defendant upon the road building activities of its principal, Bryant Brothers. During the course of the road building project, the plaintiffs furnished certain materials to Bleckley Construction Co., Inc., a subcontractor under the defendant's principal. The action was brought to recover the balance of the value of the materials furnished.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleged that the plaintiff had previously filed its suit against the subcontractor and the defendant surety in the Superior Court of Bleckley County, Ga.; that the defendant surety made a special appearance in the Superior Court of Bleckley County, answered the petition, demurred to it, and filed a plea to the jurisdiction on the ground that it was not personally present in that county and should be sued in the courts of Fulton County. Following this appearance and plea to the jurisdiction, the plaintiff filed a voluntary dismissal against the surety, whereupon the Judge of the Superior Court of Bleckley County entered an order dismissing the action against the surety without prejudice to renewal. Within six months from the order of dismissal, the present action was brought against the surety in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Ga. The defendant demurred to both counts of the petition generally, and also upon the ground that the statute of limitation barred the action. The trial judge overruled the demurrers, and the defendant excepted on the ground that the ruling was contrary to law.</div><div class="casepar">The sole question presented in this case is whether the plaintiff here has the right to renew his action within six months after dismissal, under Code  3-808, where the action previously brought against the debtor and the surety is still pending in another county as to the debtor, but was voluntarily dismissed as to the surety and recommenced within six months, and where the costs accrued in the first action have not been paid. The defendant adds to this question that the first action was never validly pending as to the surety for want of jurisdiction, but we do not agree that this is so.</div><div class="casepar">1. Code  3-808 provides that if a plaintiff shall be nonsuited, or shall discontinue or dismiss his case, and shall recommence within six months, the renewed case shall stand upon the same footing as to limitation with the original one. The term "case" under this statute has not been clearly defined. In Phillips v. Central of Ga. Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. App. 668 (93 SE 309)</span>, this court, at p. 671, discusses it in terms of "cause of action." This statute, being remedial in nature, is to be liberally construed so as to preserve the right to renew the cause of action set out in the previous suit wherever the same has been disposed of on any ground other than one affecting the merits. Atlanta, K. &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 781 (2)</span>, 785 (<span class="casemissing">47 SE 366</span>).</div><div class="casepar">It is obvious here that the Superior Court of Bleckley County had jurisdiction of the subject matter as alleged in the petition filed in that county as well as jurisdiction over the person of both parties defendant. Thus the petition as to its jurisdictional subject matter and service of process was not void. The case is still pending against the principal's subcontractor in the Superior Court of Bleckley County but was dismissed there as to the surety and recommenced in Fulton County.</div><div class="casepar">The cases cited by the defendant as authority for sustaining the plea of the statute of limitation, particularly Gray v. Hodge, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. 262</span>; Ferguson v. New Manchester Mfg. Co., <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. 609</span>, and other like cases, dealt with previous actions brought and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Here, after the defendant surety had filed a plea to the jurisdiction to the cause in the Bleckley Superior Court, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his action as to the present defendant, although it appears the action could have been maintained in that county under Code  3-204.</div><div class="casepar">The case of Atlanta, K. &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 781</span>, supra, supports the maintenance of the present action brought in Fulton County. There, as here, the question was whether the privilege of renewal within six months applied to the subsequent action brought. The Supreme Court held that where the plaintiff begins an action in a court of this State having jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and after the bar of the statute of limitation has attached, the action is dismissed because the court has no jurisdiction of the person, the action may be renewed within six months in another court of this State having jurisdiction of both the person and the subject-matter. Ibid., p. 786. In the present case, under Code  3-204, it appears that the defendant could have been made a party to the prior action, while in the Wilson case it appears the defendant could not have been made a party because of a complete lack of jurisdiction in the forum.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, in the cases of Pryse v. Cutliffe, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 548 (195 SE 913)</span>, and Cutliffe v. Pryse, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 51 (200 SE 124)</span>, the plaintiff had filed a suit for damages against two parties in the Superior Court of Baker County, to which action the sheriff made a return of non est inventus. It was subsequently discovered that one of the defendants resided in Dougherty County, who was served with a copy of the suit; she appeared and filed a plea to the jurisdiction; no service of any kind was had on the other defendant. The plaintiff thereupon dismissed his petition and filed practically the same suit against the same defendants in the City Court of Albany. The question there was whether or not the recommencement of the action fell under Code  3-808. Under these circumstances this court held that the trial court erred in holding that the second suit was barred by the statute of limitation inasmuch as the defective service was waived as of the time the first suit was dismissed. In that case there was no jurisdiction over either of the defendants in the first action filed and dismissed by the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">In the discussion of the Cutliffe case, the Supreme Court analyzed the essential cases cited by the opposing counsel in the present case. The cases cited by the defendant are distinguished by the Supreme Court from the Wilson and Cutliffe cases in that the former, such as Branch v. Mechanics Bank, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. 413</span>, are classed as suits which are void because the petition had been filed but not served upon the defendant. The Cutliffe and Wilson cases were classed as suits which are voidable not wholly void. The Supreme Court held that Code  3-808, giving the privilege of renewal after dismissal, does not apply to void suits but will apply to voidable suits. Cutliffe v. Pryse, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 51</span>, 53 (1), supra. The previous action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant in Bleckley County was not void. It follows that the privilege of renewal under Code  3-808 applies to toll the statute of limitation. The present action was seasonably brought.</div><div class="casepar">2. The second issue urged by the plaintiff under his demurrer to the petition is whether the costs were paid in the first suit before the second suit was filed as required under Code  3-508. As a general rule this issue can be raised only by a plea in abatement. Brinson v. Crainer, <span class="casemissing">72 Ga. App. 63</span>, 64 (<span class="casemissing">33 SE2d 41</span>); Sparks Imp. Co. v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">4 Ga. App. 61 (60 SE 810)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">"While the costs must be paid as a condition precedent to the renewal of an action which has been dismissed, the question as to whether the costs have been paid cannot be raised by demurrer, unless it appears, from the statements of the petition itself, that they have not been paid. If the petition is silent upon this subject, the point that the costs have not been paid and that the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to proceed must be raised by plea in abatement." Poplarville Sawmill Co. v. Driver &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">17 Ga. App. 674</span>, 675 (2) (<span class="casemissing">88 SE 30</span>); National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Ozburn, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 90 (194 SE 756)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">In the present case the petition is silent upon this subject, and the point as to the payment of the costs in the prior action was not properly raised.</div><div class="casepar"> Judgment affirmed.
