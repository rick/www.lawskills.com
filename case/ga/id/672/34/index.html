Fulton Civil Court. Before Judge Etheridge.</div><div class="casepresiding">HALL, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">To authorize a court to set aside a default judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud practiced by the successful party, the party seeking relief must show that he was prevented from making his defense by said fraud, unmixed with negligence on his part.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff (plaintiff in error on appeal), an accountant, sued the defendant, for $445.56 for services rendered. The defendant was served but filed no defense, and on January 5, 1961, default judgment was rendered against the defendant for the amount sued for and interest thereon. On March 3, 1961, the defendant filed his motion to set aside the judgment on the ground that plaintiff fraudulently obtained the judgment against him. The facts and circumstances alleged as constituting fraud are: On December 24, 1960, defendant mailed to plaintiff a check for $50.00, on the back of which defendant had written: "This check to be cashed only if Jack Hirsch CPA accepts it in full settlement and drops his legal action against J. Taylor Collier, d/b/a One Hour Martinizing. 355 Blvd. N.E., Atlanta, Georgia."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff received the check on December 26, 1960, and did not return it to defendant "but accepted same and retained same in his possession," and later cashed it; the check was paid by defendant's bank on January 16, 1961. Before cashing the check the plaintiff altered it by cutting off the following portion of the endorsement: "This check to be cashed only if Jack Hirsch CPA accepts it in full settlement and drops his legal action against J. Taylor Collier, d/b/a." Plaintiff intentionally failed and refused to dismiss the suit, in violation of the agreement or condition contained in the endorsement. On February 10, 1961, defendant learned that plaintiff had filed a garnishment on defendant's bank account. In his motion defendant contends: Plaintiff's obtaining the judgment was fraudulent because the check constituted an accord and satisfaction of the claim plaintiff sued on, and placed upon plaintiff the duty to dismiss the suit. Plaintiff snipped the endorsement from the check to hide and conceal it. Upon receiving the check plaintiff had the duty to return it if he did not accept it under the terms of the endorsement. Plaintiff did in fact accept and retain the check with the endorsement thereon, and accept and cash it as an accord and satisfaction of the claim. If plaintiff had notified defendant that he did not accept the check, defendant would have set up plaintiff's non-performance of its contract for accounting services as a defense to the suit. If defendant had known plaintiff accepted the check but did not dismiss the suit pursuant to the accord and satisfaction defendant would have acted to plead the accord and satisfaction and plaintiff's non-performance of the service contract. By not dismissing the suit and obtaining default judgment, thereby representing impliedly that the claim was still due and unpaid, contrary to his agreement contained in the endorsement, plaintiff deceived the court.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff filed general demurrers and many special demurrers to this motion, all of which were overruled by the trial court. The plaintiff excepts.</div><div class="casepar">This is an action at law to set aside a judgment on the ground it was procured by fraud. The judicial power to set aside a judgment for fraud was recognized in the Georgia Codes from 1863 to 1933: Code  37-219: "The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be set aside by a decree, for fraud, accident, or mistake, or the acts of the adverse party unmixed with the negligence or fault of the petitioner." Code  37-220: "Equity will interfere to set aside a judgment of a court having jurisdiction only where the party had a good defense of which he was entirely ignorant, or where he was prevented from making it by fraud or accident, or the act of the adverse party, unmixed with fraud or negligence on his part."</div><div class="casepar">Code  110-710 is identical with Code  37-219 except that the words "in equity" follow "decree" and the last word is "complainant" instead of "petitioner."</div><div class="casepar">The power may be exercised by courts of law as well as by courts having equity jurisdiction when proper grounds are shown. Mobley v. Mobley, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. 247</span>; Ford v. Clark, <span class="casemissing">129 Ga. 292</span>, 294 (<span class="casemissing">58 SE 818</span>); Moore v. Moore &amp; Cochran, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 597 (77 SE 820)</span>; Albright v. American Central Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">147 Ga. 492 (94 SE 561)</span>; Roberts v. Roberts, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 757 (105 SE 448)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">"As qualification of the rule [controlling the setting aside of judgments] or prerequisities to its exercise it must appear that it was not due to defendant's negligence that the fraud was perpetrated, and that due diligence would not have prevented the fraud. . . ." Leverett, Hall, Christopher, Georgia Procedure &amp; Practice 466,  21-13.</div><div class="casepar">The court's power to set aside a judgment is greatest while the judgment is in the breast of the court, that is, during the same term at which the judgment is rendered. During this term the court has plenary power over its judgments (not based upon the verdict of a jury) and may on motion revise or vacate them in its discretion. Grogan v. Deraney, <span class="casemissing">38 Ga. App. 287</span>, 290 (<span class="casemissing">143 SE 912</span>). Even so, when a party moving to set aside a judgment, during the term it was rendered, has been legally served with the suit and does not show that an alleged fraud practiced on him by the defendant prevented him from making his defense and having his day in court, this court has held it is beyond a court's power to grant the motion. Davison-Paxon Co. v. Burkhart, <span class="casemissing">92 Ga. App. 80 (88 SE2d 39)</span>; accord Coker v. Eison, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 835 (151 SE 682)</span>; Drain Tile Machine, Inc. v. McCannon, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. App. 373 (56 SE2d 165)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Similarly, to authorize setting aside a judgment after the term at which it was rendered, the actions of the adverse party that cause a party's failure to appear and defend must be of such character to show that reliance on them did not amount to laches or negligence. Penn &amp; Watson v. McGee, <span class="casemissing">6 Ga. App. 631 (65 SE 686)</span>; Gillespie v. Farkas, <span class="casemissing">19 Ga. App. 158 (91 SE 244)</span>; Peacock v. Walker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../177/69/index.html">213 Ga. 628 (100 SE2d 575)</a></span>; Courier-Herald Publishing Co. v. Georgian Co., <span class="casemissing">160 Ga. 583 (128 SE 744)</span>. Accord Gray v. Ga. Loan &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 445 (143 SE 501)</span>; Hightower v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 608 (30 SE 862)</span>; Walker v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">176 Ga. 12</span>, 19 (<span class="casemissing">166 SE 757</span>).</div><div class="casepar">In Hill v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. 412</span>, 416, the opinion of Justice McCay states: "A judgment at law ought to be conclusive on the matter in dispute. Such is not only the right of the successful party, but it is to the public interest that litigation shall end. The time of the country has already been occupied by the parties and it is due to it that they shall not make another draft upon it, if they have negligently used the opportunity previously given them. It is rather extraordinary that Mr. Hill permitted this judgment to go against him, in ignorance of the truth of the case . . . We think the bill does not show that the failure of Hill to set up his defense was unmixed with negligence on his part . . . [The facts show] in our judgment, a degree of carelessness, to say the least of it, in the conduct of Hill that gives him but little claim for an interference with the regular course of law."</div><div class="casepar">A party must be vigilant to detect fraud. Mahan v. Cavender, <span class="casemissing">77 Ga. 118</span>, 123. One who has been negligent and inactive cannot obtain relief. Beddingfield v. Old National Bank &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">175 Ga. 172 (165 SE 61)</span>; Walker v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">176 Ga. 12</span>, 19 (<span class="casemissing">166 SE 757</span>); Beavers v. Cassells, <span class="casemissing">186 Ga. 98 (196 SE 716)</span>; accord Rawleigh Co. v. Seagraves, <span class="casemissing">178 Ga. 459 (173 SE 167)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">"A person who, through ignorance, allows a judgment to go against him, can not afterwards have it set aside even on the ground of fraud, if he himself has not exercised ordinary diligence in the premises." Hoke v. Walraven, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 106</span>, 114 (<span class="casemissing">194 SE 610</span>). But when one party does give the other assurances upon which he can reasonably rely, that the suit will be dismissed or judgment will not be taken, and then procures a judgment taking advantage of the trust and confidence of the other party, the party misled, who is not himself negligent, has a ground to set aside the judgment. Dew v. Hamilton, <span class="casemissing">23 Ga. 414</span>; Dodge v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">107 Ga. 410 (33 SE 468)</span>; Bigham v. Kistler, <span class="casemissing">114 Ga. 453 (40 SE 303)</span>; Southern Ry. Co. v. Planters Fertilizer Co., <span class="casemissing">134 Ga. 527 (68 SE 95)</span>; Beverly v. Flesenthall Bros., <span class="casemissing">142 Ga. 834 (83 SE 942)</span>; Patterson v. Ga. Gravel Co., <span class="casemissing">151 Ga. 813 (108 SE 237)</span>; McGinnis v. Scheer, <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 684 (186 SE 804)</span>; Smith v. First Nat. Bank of Fitzgerald, <span class="casemissing">5 Ga. App. 139 (62 SE 826)</span>; accord Markham v. Angier, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. 43</span>; Beavers v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">199 Ga. 113 (33 SE2d 343)</span>; Hogg v. Hogg, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../197/26/index.html">206 Ga. 691</a></span>, 695 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../197/26/index.html">58 SE2d 403</a></span>). And a party who has been prevented by duress from defending a suit against him may be relieved from the judgment. Young v. Young, <span class="casemissing">188 Ga. 29 (2 SE2d 622)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">The case of Reeves v. Williams &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">160 Ga. 15 (127 SE 293)</span>, cited by the defendant as authority for granting the relief sought in this case, held that, where one intentionally used silence for the purpose of gaining an unconscionable advantage, constructive fraud could be implied from his failure to speak. However, it appears in that case that the fraudulent conduct was unmixed with any negligence of the party who was granted relief.</div><div class="casepar">In this case we do not decide the merits of defendant's contention that the plaintiff's conduct described in the motion amounted to fraud. Assuming, however, that the plaintiff's intent was fraudulent, if defendant had a good defense, the adverse judgment could have been prevented but for his negligent inaction. In this case there is no allegation of any act by the plaintiff before the judgment was rendered upon which the defendant reasonably could have placed confidence or been assured that plaintiff would not take a judgment against him, or that prevented the defendant from appearing to defend the suit. Defendant was served with the suit. He mailed to plaintiff an offer of settlement of the claim upon which the suit was brought. Can it be said that a reasonably prudent person could rely upon this fact as an assurance that the offer was accepted and the suit would be dismissed? Can it be said that the defendant, having received no acceptance of his offer, was diligent in doing nothing whatever before judgment to ascertain the status of or defend the suit pending against him? It seems the lowest degree of diligence would have required the defendant to inquire of the status of the suit, and his motion does not adequately explain his failure to make any inquiry or defense before the judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant contends that his motion pleads facts showing an accord and satisfaction on December 26, 1960, ten days before the judgment was actually taken (January 5, 1961), and eight days before default judgment could have been taken. The allegations of the motion are as follows: "That [plaintiff] received said check in due course of mail on December 26, 1960, and did not return said check to [defendant], but accepted same and retained same in his possession, and later cashed same at a time unknown to [defendant] at Herman's, Inc., a men's and boy's clothing shop, which presented same for payment to [defendant's] bank, The Citizens &amp; Southern Bank of Atlanta, where same was paid on January 16, 1961."</div><div class="casepar">While from these allegations an inference favorable to the defendant could be drawn that the plaintiff accepted the check on December 26, 1960, the pleaded facts do not support such an inference. It is elementary law in this State that pleadings are to be construed against and not for the pleader on demurrer. Therefore, the above allegations cannot be construed to show an acceptance of the offered accord and satisfaction prior to the judgment.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in overruling the general demurrer to the motion to set aside the judgment. It is therefore not necessary for this court to pass on the overruling of the special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. Felton, C.
