Pay, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/60/index.html">207 Ga. 559 (63 SE2d 399)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. In the absence in the record of evidence as to the defendants' contended issues in the case, or rulings excluding such evidence, the court did not err in failing to charge such issues.</div><div class="casepar">5. The evidence authorized the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. H. L. Anthony, Robert D. Garrett and Johnnie L. Bohannon filed an action for declaratory judgment against Thomas Calvin Anthony, Daniel Byron Anthony, Sarah Eunice Cline, Mrs. O. Vivian Bentley, Bishop Clifford Anthony and Elmer Allen Anthony--the children of Mrs. Anthony and her deceased husband, H. L. Anthony, and the only heirs at law of the latter other than Mrs. Anthony--to determine the plaintiffs' rights under a deed to certain described realty. It is alleged that H. L. Anthony conveyed said realty to plaintiff Mrs. Anthony on June 24, 1954, and died intestate on July 2, 1954; that on July 13, 1955, defendant Bishop Anthony had filed an action in Muscogee Superior Court against his mother, the present plaintiff, Mrs. Anthony, to have the conveyance from H. L. Anthony to Mrs. Anthony set aside on the ground of the grantor's alleged mental incompetency at the time of the conveyance, and seeking to be decreed a joint owner of the property as an heir at law of the grantor; that, on July 13, 1955, the court entered an order in said case enjoining and restraining Mrs. Anthony, until further order of the court, from conveying or mortgaging said property or doing any act or deed which would impair or change the ownership of it, which order also contained a rule nisi on a temporary injunction to the same effect; that a notice of lis pendens was recorded, but no further action was taken and no final determination made in the case; that, on May 30, 1968, Mrs. Anthony conveyed the property by warranty deed to plaintiffs Garrett and Bohannan, who desire to develop said property and erect improvements thereon; that the purchasers have been unable to obtain title insurance for the property because of the pending action by defendant Bishop Anthony.</div><div class="casepar">Anthony was not mentally competent to, and in fact did not execute a deed to co-plaintiffs Garrett and Bohannan; that Mrs. Anthony had not occupied the property exclusively and adversely to the claim of the other heirs of H. L. Anthony; that the alleged purchase by said co-plaintiffs was "for a grossly inadequate amount to that of a fair price or market value of the property so as to constitute fraud"; and that both the alleged deeds from H. L. Anthony to Mrs. Anthony and from Mrs. Anthony to her co-plaintiffs should be set aside and declared null and void. The plaintiffs filed their interrogatories on defendants Bishop and Elmer Anthony and the case was tried before a jury solely on the pleadings and the interrogatories on file. The court submitted the following three issues to the jury for its determination: "1. Was H. L. Anthony mentally competent on June 24, 1954, at the time of the execution of the deed to subject property to Mrs. H. L. Anthony? 2. Did H. L. Anthony in fact sign the deed referred to in the issue number one above? 3. If the answer to issue number one is negative did Mrs. H. L. Anthony acquire title by prescription by seven years' adverse possession under written evidence of title?" The jury answered the first two questions in the affirmative and did not explicitly answer the third. The court rendered judgment on the verdict, ruling that the warranty deed from H. L. Anthony to Mrs. Anthony constitutes a valid conveyance, free and clear of all claims of the defendants, and passes good, clear and merchantable title to the property to Mrs. Anthony, from which judgment defendants Bishop and Elmer Anthony appeal.</div><div class="casepar">John N. Crudup, for appellants.</div><div class="casepar">1. (a) The first ground of appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal is the filing of the notice of appeal allegedly before the entry of the judgment on the verdict. The judgment appealed from in the notice of appeal is identified merely as that one entered by the court "on the 28th of February, 1969." The only final judgment in the record was entered on March 5, 1969, from which it is apparent from the record the appeal is intended. See Brackett v. Allison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/92/index.html">119 Ga. App. 632 (1) (168 SE2d 611)</a></span>. Although the notice of appeal is dated March 3, 1969 (two days prior to the entry of the judgment intended to be appealed from), it is the filing of the notice of appeal which constitutes entering an appeal. Code Ann.  6-802, 6-803 (Ga. L. 1965, pp. 18, 20, 21, as amended); Gibson v. Hodges, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/65/index.html">221 Ga. 779 (2) (147 SE2d 329)</a></span>. The superior court clerk's filing stamp on the notice of appeal indicates March "4", with a "5" superimposed by hand on the "4." In the absence of any evidence that the filing date was altered by an unauthorized party, however, it will be presumed that the filing date is correct, hence timely. See 76 CJS 128, Records,  27.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The failure to file the enumeration of errors within 10 calendar days of the docketing of the appeal in this court does not subject the appeal to dismissal under Denham v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/06/index.html">119 Ga. App. 115 (166 SE2d 579)</a></span> and cit., since the tenth day fell on a Saturday. Code Ann.  102-102 (8) (Ga. L. 1958, pp. 388, 389; Ga. L. 1967, pp. 579, 580). The motion to dismiss is denied.</div><div class="casepar">2. "It is the duty of this court on its own motion to inquire into its jurisdiction." Hobbs v. New England Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../699/72/index.html">93 Ga. App. 687 (92 SE2d 636)</a></span> and cit. This court's jurisdiction of the appeal is established by Pond v. Pay, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/60/index.html">207 Ga. 559 (63 SE2d 399)</a></span>; s.c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/26/index.html">83 Ga. App. 817 (65 SE2d 30)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. The first enumerated error is the court's restricting of the trial to the there aforementioned issues and its failure to submit to the jury the following additional three issues, which the defendants allegedly submitted upon pre-trial and which were allegedly made a point of the record: "a. Whether Mrs. H. L. Anthony had the mental capacity to convey the property to Bohannon and Garrett. b. Whether Mrs. H. L. Anthony did in fact sign the deed. c. Whether or not the consideration from Mrs. H. L. Anthony and Bohannon and Garrett was so grossly inadequate so as to create fraud on the part of the purchasers."</div><div class="casepar">The record does not contain the alleged submission by the defendants of their contended issues in the pre-trial conference or any attempt to introduce evidence thereon at the trial, or any ruling of the court disallowing such evidence. Although such evidence might have been admissible under the answer as attended, under the state of the record before this court it must be assumed that no such evidence was attempted to be introduced. There being no evidence as to these issues, the court did not err in refusing to charge as to them.</div><div class="casepar">5. Enumerated errors 2, 3, and 4 challenge the verdict on the usual three general grounds of a motion for new trial. As to the issue of H. L. Anthony's mental capacity to convey the deed, the only evidence is that it was executed on June 24, 1954, and that he died as a patient in Milledgeville State HospItal on July 2, 1954. It is not shown when he entered the hospital, what his diagnosis was, whether he had such an illness as would affect his capacity to convey the property, or whether his incapacity, if any, existed at the time of his alleged execution of the deed. The jury was authorized to find that the defendants had failed to carry their burden of proof of his mental incapacity.</div><div class="casepar">As to the issue of whether the original grantor did in fact sign the purported deed, the copy of the deed was attached as an exhibit to the complaint. The notarized, witnessed execution must be presumed to be valid in absence of evidence tending to rebut this presumption. The mere general denial of the grantor's execution in the defendants' answer and in their answers to the plaintiffs interrogatories did no more than raise a jury question thereon. Since no further evidence was introduced to sustain the defendant's burden of proof on that issue, the jury was authorized to find the execution to be valid.</div><div class="casepar">The verdict was authorized by the evidence; therefore, the court did not err in entering judgment thereon.</div><div class="casepar">DEEN, Judge, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">1. While a notice of appeal filed prior to a final judgment is premature and ground for dismissal, where it appears that the final judgment and notice of appeal were filed on the same date it will be presumed that the judgment was filed before the notice, and the appeal will not he dismissed as premature under the rule set out in Gibson v. Hodges, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/65/index.html">221 Ga. 779 (147 SE2d 329)</a></span>. I consider it "apparent" that the final judgment was appealed from, although the date is wrongly stated in the notice of appeal. Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1072, 1073.</div><div class="casepar">2. As to the general grounds, there was evidence supporting the only issues submitted to the jury by the trial court, which was whether the grantor H. L. Anthony signed the deed in question and whether he had sufficient mental capacity to do so at the time of execution.</div><div class="casepar">This constitutes some evidence that the questions now attempted to be raised were not considered on the pre-trial hearing.</div><div class="casepar">I would affirm the judgment.</div><div class="casepar">PANNELL, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">I must dissent from the refusal of the majority to dismiss the appeal which refusal the majority based upon the authority of Section 3 of the Act of 1968 (Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1072, 1074) as applied by a majority of this court in Brackett v. Allison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/92/index.html">119 Ga. App. 632 (168 SE2d 611)</a></span>. The Act merely says that when it is apparent from the notice of appeal, the record did enumerations of error, or any combination, which judgment or judgments were appealed from, this court will consider and pass upon the appeal (providing, of course, the judgment apparently appealed from is an appealable one). The only things apparent from the notice of appeal, the record and the enumerations of error in this case is that the appeal should have been entered "from the judgment on the verdict dated March 5, 1969, and entered March 5, 1969," and it is also apparent that this was not done.</div><div class="casepar">If we look to the record, we find the judgment on the verdict which I have described, but none of the elements of this description are included in the description of the judgment appealed from in the notice of appeal. There is in the record a judgment of February 25, 1969, limiting the issues which were submitted to the jury. Error is enumerated on this judgment. Does not this judgment fit more closely the appellant's description? There is also in the record a verdict of February 28, 1969. There are three enumerations of error on the verdict. Does not this more closely fit the description given by the appellant? Does the fact that neither this judgment nor the verdict will support an appeal and the fact that the judgment of March 5, 1969, is appealable, make it apparent that the latter is the judgment appealed from? If that is what turns the trick, then a majority are in the right church, but the wrong pew, as they are applying the law to the wrong facts. For the facts here do not make the judgment actually appealed from apparent but only make apparent the judgment which should have been appealed from. The Act of 1968 contains no language which will support this construction placed up on it by the majority. While I dissented from the case relied upon by the majority, Brackett v. Allison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/92/index.html">119 Ga. App. 632</a></span>, supra, that case itself expressly excluded from its operation and distinguished therefrom cases such as the present one. In the present case, there is nothing in the description of the judgment appealed from which ties it in with the judgment of March 5, 1969. Let us read from what was the special concurrence of Judge Deen, which was ultimately incorporated by express quotation into the majority opinion in that case. "If our only clue is the date, it may be that examination of the record will not be sufficient to make the judgment appealed from apparent. But this is not the only clue. The appeal is from the 'judgment and decree.' A glance at the orders indicates that only one is called a 'judgment and decree' and only one could possibly be termed a judgment and decree." P. 633. It is apparent from the description of the judgment here, which is described only by date, the present case fits the exception acknowledged by the majority in the Brackett v. Allison case.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal should be dismissed.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"></div><div class="casechrono">SUBMITTED MAY 5, 1969 -- DECIDED SEPTEMBER 4, 1969.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="caseinlinks"><div class="header">
