(a) The plaintiff in error is not in the position of a bona fide purchaser for value.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The jury was authorized to find against the contention of ratification.</div><div class="casepar">(c) There was nothing to restore.

Alleged errors, not likely to occur on another trial, will not be considered.</div><div class="casepar">4. Counsel having agreed to limit the time of their argument to the jury, it was not error for the court to so limit it.</div><div class="casepar">On April 25, 1950, Mrs. Dahlia P. Parker filed suit for damages again C. L. Boyd in the Superior Court of Screven County, Georgia, in which she prayed judgment against the defendant for $15,486, on account of the defendant having feloniously killed her husband, Orel D. Parker, by beating and shooting him with a pistol. On April 27, 1950, Mrs. Dahlia Parker presented her verified petition and statutory bond for attachment to the judge of the said court, and prayed for attachment against the property of C. L. Boyd, as provided for in Code  8-401 et seq. On the same date, the court directed that a writ of attachment issue in favor of the said plaintiff against the said defendant, and a writ of attachment was issued in accordance with that order. The sheriff levied on two tracts of land in Screven County as the land of the defendant, one tract containing 103 acres, and the other containing 22 acres, and a return was made accordingly. On November 20, 1950, Mrs. Dahlia Parker filed her declaration in attachment against C. L. Boyd. On November 24, 1950, judgment was rendered in the original action for damages in favor of the plaintiff in that action for $7000, and on December 4, 1950, judgment was rendered in the suit in attachment in favor of the plaintiff for the same amount. The following day fi. fas. issued from the Superior Court of Screven County based upon the judgment in attachment, and fi. fas. were levied upon both tracts of land. The property was duly advertised for sale, the date of the sale being set as January 2, 1951.</div><div class="casepar">On January 1, 1951, Lucinda Boyd, defendant in error in the instant case, filed her claim to the land theretofore levied upon as the land of C. L. Boyd, together with the proper affidavits. It was agreed by counsel for both the plaintiff and the claimant that the sale should be held as advertised, and that the proceeds should be held by the clerk of the court, subject to the final order of the court. The 103-acre tract of land was sold on the day advertised for $8050. The 22-acre tract has not been sold. On July 19, 1951, Lucinda Boyd amended her original claim, and alleged that a certain deed executed by her on April 3, 1947, conveying certain described lands, which lands include those here in question, to her husband, was null and void because executed under duress. She also alleged that a certain deed executed by her on February 23, 1950, conveying to C. L. Boyd a one-half undivided interest in the 103-acre tract of land was likewise null and void because it was also executed under duress.</div><div class="casepar">The instant case was heard on July 19, 1950, before a judge and jury, and at the conclusion of the evidence and the charge of the court, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the claimant, Lucinda Boyd. The plaintiff's motion for new trial was duly filed and overruled. The exception here is to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. (a) The general grounds of the motion for new trial and special ground 5 of the amendment to the motion for new trial, which is an elaboration of the general grounds, raise several questions relative to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury. The first question presented is whether the claimant's undisclosed equity--there being no evidence that the plaintiff in error had notice of her equity before the levy was made--is subject to the lien of the levy.</div><div class="casepar">Code  8-102 provides for attachment in "all cases of money demands, whether arising ex contractu or ex delicto . . . when the defendant shall have placed himself in such situation as will authorize a plaintiff to sue out attachment." See also Graves v. Strozier, <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. 32</span>. Code  8-905 provides that the lien of an attachment is created by the levy, and not the judgment on the attachment. The plaintiff in error contends that, since she had no notice of any claim by the defendant in error until after the levy of the attachment was made, the lien dates from the levy, and she is in the position of an innocent purchaser, and the property levied upon is subject to the lien.</div><div class="casepar">We can not agree that the plaintiff in error is in the position of a bona fide purchaser. In Burke v. Anderson, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. 535</span>, it was said: "A judgment creditor is undoubtedly a privy. His only right to any interference turns on his connection with one of the parties. He claims under him, and as a general rule, has only such rights as belong to the debtor. His lien is on the property of the debtor, such property as really belongs to him, and not to such as he only seems to have. He can pursue his rights, in spite of mere nominal titles in others parties. He can go beneath the surface and subject to his debt, in equity, even the equitable rights of his debtor. But he may also be met by equities of other persons. For whilst it is the policy of the law to subject fully the assets of a debtor to the discharge of his debts, it is not the policy of the law to do this with property that only nominally belongs to him, its real equitable ownership resting in others.</div><div class="casepar">We have quoted extensively from the above-cited case because the language quoted is determinative of this phase of the instant case. The lien which the plaintiff in error seeks to enforce is not a lien acquired by contract, but is a lien given her by law. She is not, therefore, in the position of a bona fide purchaser, and her lien extends only to the property levied upon which actually belongs to the defendant in attachment. It is therefore not necessary for the defendant in error to prove that the plaintiff in error had notice of her claim to the property before the levy in attachment was made.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The plaintiff in error next contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury, for the reason that it showed that the defendant in error had ratified the deed of April 3, 1947, and also the deed of February 23, 1950. The plaintiff in error points out numerous acts and omissions which she contends amount to a ratification of the above deeds. The defendant in error contends that these acts and omissions resulted from the same duress that caused the execution of the deeds, and that there was never any intention to ratify the deeds. Whether the acts and omissions complained of were the result of duress, and whether or not there was an intention to ratify the deeds, were questions of fact to be determined by the jury. Gray v. Bass, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. 270</span>. The jury in the instant case found in favor of the defendant in error. There was sufficient evidence to authorize this finding.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The plaintiff in error further contends that the defendant in error is not entitled to prevail in her claim because the evidence shows that she has received $950 and certain personal property in a property settlement with C. L. Boyd, dated February 23, 1950, and that she has not offered to restore these benefits to C. L. Boyd. Assuming, but not deciding, that the plaintiff in error can raise this question in this proceeding, there is no merit in this contention. The agreement under which the defendant in error received the $950 from her husband, C. L. Boyd, was a separation agreement. It is not that agreement which is sought to be avoided here, although there was evidence that this agreement was also executed under duress. There is no evidence of any benefits that the defendant in error received under the deed of April 3, 1947, or the deed of February 23, 1950. Since the evidence shows that the defendant in error received no benefits under the deeds she seeks to avoid, there was nothing to restore, and no restoration was, of course, necessary.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The plaintiff in error next contends that the evidence is not sufficient to support the verdict because the evidence shows that the defendant in error was estopped to assert her ownership of the property in question under the doctrine of election of remedies. This contention is based upon a petition for divorce filed by the defendant in error prior to the time she filed her claim in this action, in which she alleged that the property in question was owned by her husband. There is no merit in this contention, for the reason that neither the parties nor the causes of action in the two suits are the same.</div><div class="casepar">2. In ground 1 of the amendment to the motion for new trial the plaintiff in error complains because the trial judge charged the jury that the plaintiff had the burden of proof. The evidence showed without contradiction that the defendant in fi. fa. was in possession of the property levied upon. Therefore, the burden of proof was upon the claimant, and it was error for the judge to place the burden of proof upon the plaintiff. See Code,  39-904.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special grounds 2 and 3 complain of errors in the charge of the court. Since the errors complained of are such as will not likely occur on another trial, and since the judgment of the court below is being reversed and a new trial must be had, it is not necessary to consider them here.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special ground 4 complains because the trial judge limited the argument by counsel for the plaintiff in error to one hour and seven minutes. The record shows, however, that it was agreed by counsel for both sides and the court, before arguments were begun, that the arguments would be limited to one hour for each side. It was clearly not error for the court to hold counsel to his agreement.</div><div class="casepar">For reasons appearing in division 2 of this opinion, the judgment of the court below must be reversed.</div><div class="casepar">I do not concur in the ruling that the parties are different, since, as ruled in division 1 of the opinion, the same parties or their privy are involved.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Wm.
