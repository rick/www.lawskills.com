Exceptions to the refusal of the trial court to grant a nonsuit may not be made the grounds of a motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">4. The evidence supported the verdict, and the trial court did not err in overruling the general grounds of the motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Carl Edmondson, doing business as Wright Plumbing and Heating, petitioned to foreclose a materialman's lien on property of Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Langford. the defendants filed their plea and answer. The case came on for trial before the judge and a jury, evidence was introduced for the plaintiff and for the defendant, and at the conclusion of the testimony the trial court directed a verdict for the plaintiff and judgment was entered thereon for the amount claimed to be due, and granting a special lien against the property described in the petition. The defendant made a motion for a new trial on the general grounds, which was amended by the addition of three special grounds. The court overruled that motion and the defendant excepted.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that at the instance of one Shelton he, operating under the aforementioned trade name, had placed plumbing supplies on the premises of the defendants as described in the petition and had performed labor thereon in installing the said plumbing supplies, all to the extent of $759.60, as set out in the account attached as an exhibit to the petition; that the said Shelton had been adjudged a bankrupt; that the plaintiff had filed the lien before Shelton was adjudged bankrupt; and that the amount of equipment and material he had placed on the defendant's building had not been paid for either by Shelton or by the defendants. The plaintiff testified also that because of Shelton's bankruptcy the job was not completed though he had all the material on hand and was ready to complete the job. The defendant offered evidence to the effect that he had contracted with Shelton for the improvement of his property; that Shelton did not perform his contract with him; that he lacked "all the upper part of the back and all of the plumbing"; that though the contract price was $6708, he had paid Shelton over $7000; that he dealt with Shelton and no one else. Woodrow Shelton testified in behalf of the defendant that he was the prime contractor on the job in question, that he had been paid the full price of the contract; that he had applied the funds received from the defendant for materials to go into the building; that the amount of $759 claimed by the plaintiff was too much for the work the plaintiff had done; that the plaintiff did not furnish several small items listed on the bill of particulars; that he did not purchase the "stuff they have there on that contract. I never purchased anything like that" that he paid the plaintiff something over $200; that while he was working on the defendant's job he had two other jobs on which the plaintiff was working, and that he did not tell the plaintiff to apply his payments to him on any particular job.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The third special ground of the motion for a new trial is in the following language: "Because the court directed a verdict against movants at the conclusion of the introduction of evidence. That the case should have been submitted to the jury and the refusal to do so was hurtful to movants because there was not sufficient evidence to authorize a verdict against movants and said verdict was contrary to the evidence and the law governing the case." This is the only ground that purports to assign error on the action of the court in directing the verdict and as will be seen the only reason assigned as to why the verdict was improperly directed is that "there was not sufficient evidence to authorize a verdict against movants and said verdict was contrary to the evidence and the law governing the case." This is nothing more than an amplification and restatement of the general grounds of the motion, and under the repeated rulings of this court and of the Supreme Court is not a sufficient assignment of error to raise the question off the propriety of the judgment directing the verdict. See, for example, Head v. Towaliga Falls Power Co., <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 142</span> (107 S. E. 558); Stone v. Hebard Lumber Co., <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 729 (2)</span> (89 S. E. 814); Alley v. Candler, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 739 (1)</span> (118 S. E. 354). In this connection, then, we have for consideration only the question of whether the evidence authorized the verdict directed. The evidence, while conflicting in some material particulars, was sufficient to support the verdict, and the trial court did not err in overruling the motion for a new trial on the general grounds, and on the third special ground.</div><div class="casepar">2. The second special ground of the motion for a new trial complains because the court excluded testimony by Woodrow Shelton that all of the money received by him was applied by him to debts which would have been liens against the property of the defendants. While it is competent for the owner of the real estate to defend the foreclosure of a materialman's lien by showing that he has paid to the prime contractor the full contract price and that the prime contractor has in turn applied such proceeds to accounts which would or might have become liens against the property ( Tuck v. Moss Manufacturing Co., <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 729 (1)</span>, 56 S. E. 1001), nevertheless we think that the trial court correctly excluded the testimony of Shelton, as offered in this case, on the ground that such testimony was a mere conclusion unsupported by any facts. Shelton did not testify as to whom or for what such funds received from the defendant were disbursed by him, and, in the absence of some factual showing, such testimony was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of law.</div><div class="casepar">3. The first ground of the amendment to the motion for a new trial assigns error on the refusal of the trial court to grant a nonsuit at the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence, on the ground that no suit against the prime contractor for the recovery of the amount due had been filed by the plaintiff. It is well settled that exceptions to the refusal of the trial court to grant a nonsuit may not be made the ground of a motion for a new trial. Don v. Don, <span class="casemissing">163 Ga. 31 (3)</span> (135 S. E. 409); Willis v. Seiberling Rubber Co., <span class="casemissing">44 Ga. App. 468 (8)</span> (161 S. E. 789).</div><div class="casepar">4. With respect to the general grounds and the right of the plaintiff to maintain this action without first suing the prime contractor, Shelton, the evidence in this case sufficiently shows that the prime contractor, Shelton, had been adjudicated a bankrupt and that he had by the judgment of the United States District Court of the Northern District of Georgia, been discharged from his civil liabilities. Under such state of facts the provisions of the second paragraph of subsection 3 of  67-2002 (Ga. Code, Ann. Supp.) would seem to apply. The pertinent portion of the paragraph is as follows: "In the event any contractor procuring material, labor or supplies for building, repairing or improving any real estate, building, or other structure shall abscond or remove from the State within 12 months from the date such labor, supplies or material are furnished him, so that personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained of said contractor in a suit for said material labor or supplies, or if, after the filing of suit against such contractor, no final judgment can be obtained against him for the value of such material, labor or supplies, by reason of the bankruptcy of said contractor and his subsequent discharge from civil liabilities, then and in any of said events, the person or persons so furnishing material, labor or supplies shall be relieved of the necessity of obtaining judgment against such contractor as a prerequisite to enforcing a lien against the property improved by said contractor, and may, subject to the provision of section 67-2001, enforce said lien directly against the property so improved, in an action against the owner thereof, but with the judgment rendered in any such proceeding to be limited to a judgment in rem against the property improved and to impose no personal liability upon the owner of said property." The only reasonable construction of the provisions of this paragraph as applied to the facts of this case is that, where the prime contractor is adjudicated a bankrupt during the time the materialman or laborer is performing his contract, the said materialman or laborer is relieved of doing an obviously useless thing in bringing suit against the bankrupt prime contractor before perfecting his lien against the improved property. For this reason the trial court did not err in overruling the general grounds of the motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Sutton, C. J., concurs.
