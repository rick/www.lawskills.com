June 17, 1950.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The court did not err in overruling the motion for new trial for any of the reasons assigned.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant was convicted of assault with intent to murder with a recommendation by the jury that he be punished as for a misdemeanor. The court imposed a sentence of 12 months or $200 fine. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, and thereafter by amendment, added three special grounds. The evidence is substantially: Anthony Pryor, the prosecutor, testified that on April 15, 1950, the defendant shot him with a pistol; that on the day in question the witness and his brother intended to go to Graymont; that in looking for his brother he passed by the home of the defendant and went into the house; that he had a conversation with Johnnie Washington, who was boarding with the defendant; that he inquired of Johnnie Washington if he had seen the brother of the witness, and Johnnie Washington stated to the witness that he had seen the brother of the witness, and that the brother went over to Mr. Johnston's home and said that he would be back shortly. Johnnie Washington asked the witness to come in and have a seat. The witness did this. At that time Johnnie Washington was lying on the bed with his feet hanging on the floor. Johnnie Washington asked the witness to put a piece of wood on the fire, which the witness did. This was about 30 or 35 minutes before the witness got shot. The witness left the defendant's house and later came back to the defendant's house, in about 30 or 35 minutes. When the witness returned to the house of the defendant, he knocked on the door and when he knocked on the door the defendant shot him through the closed door. When the defendant knocked on the door someone in the house asked who was knocking, and the witness answered: "Anthony Pryor" and said, "open the door, Johnnie, [meaning Johnnie Washington.]" The witness heard a drawer pulled open and shoved back, and then heard another drawer pulled open which he did not hear shoved back. The defendant made about two steps toward the door and shot the witness. The witness exclaimed: "Oh Lord, Johnnie, you shot me and shot me for nothing. Some of you all come and help me." The shot came through the door and went through the thigh of the witness and "on somewhere." The witness did not know if the defendant, Johnnie Jones, was there. He thought it was Johnnie Washington, who had told the witness to come back after looking for his brother. The witness went back by the house, to see Johnnie Washington who also lived in the house with the defendant. The witness and Johnnie Jones never had had any trouble. The witness, the defendant and Johnnie Washington all worked at the same place.</div><div class="casepar">On cross-examination the witness testified in addition to direct testimony that they were not working that day. The witness testified that he, himself, had not had a drop to drink that day; that the defendant was the man who was drunk that day; that the defendant offered the witness a drink prior to the shooting; that the witness had a pint of "white lightning" in his pocket; that the defendant was drunk all the morning; that the witness did not go to the defendant's house for a drink; that the witness does not drink; that Dr. Oliff had stopped him from drinking because of high blood pressure. Then he indicated how he knocked on the door of defendant's house, by knocking on the desk. He testified that when he knocked, someone said: "Who is that?" Then, the witness repeated his name and asked Johnnie [meaning Johnnie Washington] to open the door, and someone got off the bed and said, "l will open the door." Then it was when about two more steps were made toward the door and the defendant shot the witness. The witness had never had any trouble with the defendant and had never given him any cause to shoot, but on the other hand the witness and the defendant visited each other. He testified further that he had been to the defendant's house sometimes "away in the night" and that he would borrow money from the defendant and the defendant would borrow money from him. The defendant would open the door on such occasions without any trouble. The witness stated that he did not kick the door at all, did not break the latch on the door; that he never cursed the defendant in his life. The witness testified that the pistol was a P-38 German Luger. Johnnie Lee Martin took the defendant to the hospital. The bullet did not break the bone in the witness's leg. He remained in the hospital for some time.</div><div class="casepar">Johnnie Washington testified for the State that he was lying down in the house on the bed and saw the defendant shoot Anthony Pryor. At the time the defendant shot Anthony Pryor the defendant was standing at the foot of the bed. He shot through the door. When the defendant shot through the door the witness heard Anthony Pryor cry out. He testified that Anthony Pryor had been there before that day; had been there and talked to the witness. The witness told Anthony Pryor to stop back by there and Anthony stopped back by there. "Anthony knocked on the door and was kicking and cursing. He wasn't trying to hurt anybody and we [meaning the witness and defendant] were on the inside. I don't reckon Anthony knew Johnnie [meaning the defendant] was there. He stopped by to say something to me. I don't know what caused Johnnie to get up and shoot, but Johnnie was lying down on the bed; he and I were both lying down on the bed and so Johnnie never said anything, and I never said anything when Anthony Pryor came up and knocked on the door and kicked on the door and Anthony said 'I know you all, two bad s.o.b's in there; you've got a good gun, get up and use it' and Johnnie never said anything. Johnnie got up off the bed and walked around to his chest of drawers, reached and pulled the drawer open, and got the gun and walked to the foot of the bed and shot him, shot right through the door. I did not go on out there where he was; whenever I got up and went out there Johnnie Lee had carried him in the automobile to the hospital. I did not get under the bed; I was not still lying on the bed, I got up and put on my shoes, but I didn't go out there on the front porch until after the boy had already carried him away to the hospital.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant made the following statement: "I had just come home. I went in the house, and laid down on the bed, and I was in there taking my rest, about half asleep, and Anthony Pryor (they said it was him, I don't know who it was) he came and kicked on the door and cursing and talking about the kind of a gun it was. And I got up and got the gun out of the drawer and fired the gun, so I haven't seen nobody and nobody saw me, and I didn't know I hit--wasn't trying to hit him, just trying to scare him off from my door. I was trying to protect my house; he kicked the bottom of that door and there wasn't anything on the door but a little old latch. I got a little old nail there, six penny nail at the bottom and a latch on the top, and he came there bamming on the door and kicking it off and cursing out to the door, using slang, claims he didn't curse, He was slinging all kind of black guard through there, and I just shot to try to protect my house. I want to say I wasn't trying to kill anybody, I was there taking my resting, lying down. I wasn't bothering a soul in the world, had just come in home, lying down fixing to go up town after I got up. I was born on Savannah Avenue in 1901 and the law in Statesboro has never arrested me for drunkenness or anything. Nobody here in Statesboro can say a black word about me because I ain't never bothered nobody. I stay in my place and other people stay in theirs; nobody has locked me up for drunkenness, reckless driving or anything in the whole time I been in Statesboro. I own a house right here on East Main Street, and nobody can come up here and say anything about me, and tell the truth, so that's the way it was." Anthony Pryor, in rebuttal, denied what the witness stated as to Anthony's cursing and kicking, and stated that he owned a home also, and had never been arrested for anything.</div><div class="casepar">The police officer stated that he was called to the scene of the shooting, and that when he arrived at the house where the defendant and Johnnie Washington were living, the defendant was gone. Johnnie Washington was there. There was a hole shot through the door from the inside. "It just scattered all out on the porch." The officer found a lot of blood where Anthony fell. The officer was informed that Johnnie Jones, the defendant, had been seen running from his house after the shooting. The officer captured the defendant before he could escape.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. So far as the general grounds are concerned, the evidence abundantly sustains the verdict. The jury had a right to believe the testimony of Anthony Pryor; they had a right to believe him in preference to that portion of Johnnie Washington's testimony to the effect that Anthony Pryor was cursing and kicking on the door. They had a right to believe the statement of the defendant in whole or in part, or to disbelieve it.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 1 states that the court erred in charging the jury as follows: "Now, a man has a right to defend his home, his habitation, against intruders and against assaults made upon him, but I charge you that he does not have any right to adopt any means in an effort to protect his home other than necessary to protect it. In other words, provocation by words, threats, menaces, contemptuous gestures or any other thing of that kind would not justify, would not be sufficient to justify and free a person from an attempt to kill a person. He is entitled to use only such force as is necessary to prevent his habitation being invaded by somebody who undertakes to invade it, if you find that an attempt was made."</div><div class="casepar">It is contended that this charge was inadequate and did not sufficiently instruct the jury as to the law governing the case on trial. It is contended that the court should have been charged as follows: "A person may be justified in killing to prevent his habitation from being entered through violence or surprise by persons attempting to enter in a riotous manner, even though they have no actual or apparent intention to commit a felony therein but intending merely to commit a misdemeanor upon the slayers or some person dwelling in the habitation."</div><div class="casepar">Counsel cite in support of this, Brown v. State, <span class="casemissing">8 Ga. App. 383 (6)</span> (69 S. E. 45). Under the facts of the instant case the court did not err as set forth in special ground 1, and the Brown case, supra, does not sustain the contentions of counsel for the defendant under the facts of this case. The Code section on this subject will be found codified as  26-1013, which reads as follows: "If after persuasion, remonstrance, or other gentle measures used, a forcible attack and invasion on the property or habitation of another cannot be prevented, it shall be justifiable homicide to kill the person so forcibly attacking and invading the property or habitation of another. but it must appear that such killing was absolutely necessary to prevent such attack and invasion, and that a serious injury was intended or might accrue to the person, property, or family of the person killing." We think that the charge of the court was more favorable to the defendant than he was entitled to under the evidence in this case.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special grounds 2 and 3 assign error because the court did not charge upon the doctrine of reasonable fears. The facts of this case, neither from the defendant's statement nor otherwise made it reversible error not to charge this doctrine, either as to whether it was dependent upon direct or circumstantial evidence. The case of Hughes v. State, <span class="casemissing">159 Ga. 828</span>, 837 (2) (127 S. E. 113), does not sustain the contention of the defendant, under the facts of this case, from any viewpoint. In this connection, see Nixon v. State, <span class="casemissing">101 Ga. 574</span> (28 S. E. 971), to the effect that opprobrious words are not sufficient to justify an attempt with a deadly weapon. See also Mitchell v. State, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 272 (3)</span> (34 S. E. 576).</div><div class="casepar">In conclusion, we might state that counsel for the defendant contend that no reason for the shooting and no malice were shown. We think that the jury were au theorized to find from the evidence that the defendant showed an abandoned and malignant heart brought about by voluntary intoxication. It appears from the entire record that the defendant received a very light sentence indeed from the jury and the court under all the facts of this case.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Walton Usher, Solicitor-General, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">W.
