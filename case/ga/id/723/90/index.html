The petition as amended is not subject to, and the court did not err in overruling, the general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">2.

"Legal results arising from the facts alleged may be pleaded in general terms or in the form of a legal conclusion," and, under the facts pleaded in this case, the allegation that the death of the plaintiff's husband resulted solely from the negligence of the defendant, was not subject to special demurrer as being a conclusion.</div><div class="casepar">4. The allegations of the petition respecting a provision of the written contract of employment between the deceased and the defendant were irrelevant to the cause of action and should have been stricken on demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">5. The allegations of paragraph 7, as amended, wherein the plaintiff alleges three inconsistent and contradictory ways in which the injury and death of her husband occurred, after having alleged elsewhere in the petition that she could not allege the facts, were subject to special demurrer, and the plaintiff should have been required to strike such allegations or to set them up in separate and distinct counts.</div><div class="casepar">6. The allegations of paragraph 7 of the petition negativing contributory negligence on the part of the deceased were not subject to the special demurrer urged.</div><div class="casepar">Katherine Elizabeth Stoddard, as temporary administratrix of the estate of Albert Dell Stoddard, sued Seaboard Air-Line Railroad Company for damages for the death of the said Albert Dell Stoddard, her husband. She alleged that her husband was an employee of the defendant, having worked as a pipe-fitter helper in the defendant's, shops in Chatham County and that his employment was in furtherance of interstate commerce. In paragraph 6 of the petition, as amended, she alleges that on the 11th day of March, 1949, her husband was in the performance of his duties as a pipe-fitter helper under the direction of the defendant's agent and was engaged in assisting his immediate superior, N. R. Marshall, who was then engaged in annealing copper pipe which was a part of the equipment of a railroad locomotive belonging to the defendant; that at the time petitioner's husband was at his proper place in the room or shed where said annealing was being done; that in the said shed and to the northward of the position where the annealing was being done, there was a brick furnace upon the top of which and integral therewith there was an iron pot; that under the iron pot and in the furnace there was a coal fire for melting babbitt metal; that within the aforesaid room or shed was a metal tank or cylinder containing kerosene or some other inflammable liquid, to which, cylinder was connected a hose to the opposite end of which was connected a burner or nozzle at which point the kerosene would be ignited and the flame thus produced used in the annealing process which was then being carried on by the defendant's agent, Marshall; that in order to operate the said burner the defendant maintained compressed air in said tank or container of 100 or more pounds per square inch, which forced the inflammable fluid through the hose connected with the burner.</div><div class="casepar">It is further alleged in paragraph 6 that suddenly and without warning a sheet of flame enveloped the room in which the petitioner's husband was working, bunting him so severely that he died as a result thereof a short while later; that at that time there were in the room where the incident occurred three named persons each of whom was injured by the flame; that "notwithstanding diligent efforts made by your petitioner to ascertain, for the purpose of being able to allege herein the precise origin of the fire which destroyed the life of her said husband, she has been unable to do so and she alleges that for the want of information plaintiff is unable to allege from what source the fluid was expelled or what caused the same to escape from the tank or container under pressure, resulting in said fluid coming into contact with some agency which ignited it causing the fire and consequent death and injuries to those present in said room or shed. That whatever condition or event which existed resulting in the fire and fatal burning of petitioner's husband was not in any wise caused or contributed to by any act done by your petitioner's husband, who at the time of said fatal injuries was at a place where he had a right to be and in the discharge of duties for which he was employed by defendant as a pipe-fitter helper."</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 7 of the petition as amended is as follows: "Your petitioner further shows that the burns inflicted upon petitioner's late husband which caused his death within about five hours after he received the said fatal burns was due solely and entirely to the negligence of the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, in that the defendant failed to furnish the deceased and the aforementioned pipe fitters with machinery and tools kept by the defendant in a safe and working condition as required by the terms of Rule 47 of the agreement between the defendant and System Federation 39 Railway Employees Department American Federation of Labor Mechanical Section No. 1 thereof, of which federation your petitioner's late husband was a member at the time of receiving the fatal injuries hereinbefore mentioned and which resulted in his death, the said Rule 47 being as follows:</div><div class="casepar">" 'The management, with the cooperation of the employees, will keep shops and yards in a clean and sanitary condition and all machinery and tools in a safe and working condition.' That your petitioner, because of the facts stated in paragraph . . . six of the petition, being unable to ascertain the precise cause and origin of the fatal fire which destroyed the life of petitioner's husband so as herein to allege the same, charges the defendant with negligence in that (a) a hose forming the connection between the storage tank and burner was very old and had been so weakened by the length of time it had been in service and the liquid which had passed into and through the same, that it was unable to withstand the compressed air pressure in said tank which was between 100 and 110 pounds per square inch, thus bursting the said hose at some point along its course, spewing the said inflammable liquid upon, against or into the fire burning under the babbitt melting pot, which fire ignited the said stream of kerosene or other inflammable liquid, thus forcibly projected from said hose into said fire producing the flames which enveloped the said shop room or shed and the body of your petitioner's late husband, causing the burns which produced his death as hereinbefore more particularly stated. (b) That the said hose was connected with a nipple inserted into the metal container holding the kerosene or other inflammable liquid and that while the said Marshall was using said equipment in the process of annealing the copper pipe upon which he was working at the time of said fire, he pulled said hose loose from the nipple to which it was attached, thus re leasing under pressure the contents of said container which caused the fire hereinbefore mentioned and the manner described. That had the defendant, its servants and agents and employees performed their full duties as required by Rule 47 hereinbefore mentioned and as required by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the said hose would not have become detached from the said nipple and without which detachment the said inflammable fluid could not have escaped and caused the injuries and death herein complained of. (c) That attached to or inserted ill the said metal container holding the kerosene or other inflammable liquid under compressed air pressure as hereinbefore alleged was a metal nipple for the purpose of enabling the hose forming a part of the torch line to be connected with the said tank so as to obtain a flow of kerosene or other inflammable liquid through the said hose to the burner or torch attached to the other end of such hose to be there ignited and used by the pipe fitter in performing the work at hand. That the said nipple was insecurely affixed to the said metal container and by reason of the length of time it had been in service had become so weakened and insecure that while said hose and burner or torch was being used by the pipe fitter at the time of the said fatal burning of petitioner's late husband, the said nipple broke off from the said container causing the kerosene or other inflammable liquid in the same to be forced therefrom under the said pressure of compressed air coming into contact with the fire under the babbitt melting pot, thus producing the sheet of flame which enveloped the said room or shed and the body of your petitioner's late husband causing his death as aforesaid.</div><div class="casepar">To the petition as amended the defendant demurred generally and specially. The court overruled all the demurrers and the exception here is to that order.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The defendant demurred generally to the petition on the ground that no cause of action was set forth against the defendant; and also on the ground that the facts alleged in paragraph 6 show upon their face that the plaintiff has no knowledge of the origin of the fire, or from what source the fluid was expelled, or what caused the same to escape from the tank or container, or what or who caused the accident, and thus the petition fails to set forth a cause of action against the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">While we recognize the rule that on demurrer a plaintiff's petition will be construed most strongly against him and that if there is any inference which may reasonably be drawn from the petition against his right to recover such inference will prevail; and that a demurrer admits only well-pleaded facts and not conclusions, and while we also recognize that the Federal Employers' Liability Act does not create liability on the part of the railroad without fault ( Jamison v. Encarnacion, 281 U. S. 635, 640, 641 (50 Sup. Ct. 440, 74 L. ed. 1082), nevertheless, we think that the petition as amended, set forth a cause of action good as against a general demurrer. Much is made by the plaintiff in error of the fact that the plaintiff pleads in her petition that because of the failure or refusal of the defendant's agents to divulge the exact cause of the inflammable fluid escaping from the tank which resulted in the fire which killed her husband that she cannot allege such cause and that therefore her petition shows that she is unable to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, and that the necessity that she allege negligence under the act is not met by her petition. Putting aside for the moment any consideration of the allegations of subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 7, and of the special demurrer attacking them, let us examine the allegations of the petition as a whole respecting the manner in which the injury and death occurred. The plaintiff sets out in consideraable detail a description of the place in which the deceased was working, that he was engaged in work in the furtherance of interstate commerce thus bringing him within the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and that while he was thus engaged in the performance of his duties and without any contributory negligence on his part he was suddenly enveloped in flames resulting from kerosene or some other inflammable liquid being ejected from a tank or hose connected therewith and thrown into or on the stove over which deceased was working, and that he died as a result of that occurrence. We think that these facts which are plainly alleged in the petition are sufficient to raise an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant in failing to maintain some part of the equipment of its shop in a reasonably safe condition or in furnishing the deceased with a reasonably safe place in which to work, and sufficient to bring the plaintiff within the purview of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. It is not necessary that the plaintiff set forth in explicit detail wherein or how such defect existed or contributed to the injury, but she would seem to be relieved of this requirement when she alleges in paragraph 6 that despite diligent efforts on her part she has been unable to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.</div><div class="casepar">Certainly, it is a most unusual, out of the ordinary and unexpected thing for a workman to be burned or, as alleged in the petition here, "cooked" alive while performing his ordinary duties for an employer, and we think that the petition sufficiently alleges that the deceased met his death as the result of the employer's negligence. While there is no presumption of negligence against the railroad, it would be a most curious anomaly to hold that where because of the concealment of the employer, or from some other cause, the plaintiff could not obtain the facts, she could not proceed to assert her rights against the defendant. Furthermore, the important fact in this case is not what caused the fluid to escape from the tank or hose or nozzle, but that it did so, and that the plaintiff's husband was injured and died as a result of the fire that ensued, and, where as here, after alleging the fact of the occurrence, the petition alleges that the death of the petitioner's husband was caused by an instrumentality of the defendant under its management and control and as a result of the negligence of the defendant, such allegations, we think, are sufficient to raise an inference of a breach of duty on the part of the defendant and of legal liability to the plaintiff. For these reasons the petition was not subject to the general demurrer and the trial court did not err in overruling it. See Miller v. Ben H. Fletcher Co., <span class="casemissing">142 Ga. 668 (5)</span> (83 S. E. 521).</div><div class="casepar">2. The first ground of special demurrer attacks the last sentence of paragraph 6 of the petition, as amended, and the allegation that whatever condition or event resulted in the fire and fatal burning of the petitioner's husband was not in any wise caused or contributed to by any act of the deceased who, at the time he received his injuries, was where he had a right to be and in the discharge of his duties, on the ground that it is a conclusion of the pleader not borne out by other allegations in said paragraph and should be stricken. This ground of demurrer is without merit. The allegation that the deceased was without fault is an allegation of fact ( Charleston &amp; Western Carolina Ry. Co. v. Lyons, <span class="casemissing">5 Ga. App. 668 (2)</span>, 673, 63 S. E. 862), and this rule is not changed by the fact that elsewhere in the petition the plaintiff alleges that she does not know exactly the facts which contributed to cause the fire which resulted in the death of her husband.</div><div class="casepar">3. The second ground of special demurrer is as follows: "Defendant demurs specially to the allegations contained in said petition as amended as a whole and particularly to the allegation contained in paragraph 7 of the petition as amended which alleges that the burns inflicted upon petitioner's late husband and; his death were due solely and entirely to the negligence off the defendant, its agents, servants and employees, upon the ground that said allegation is a conclusion of the pleader, is contradictory, vague, indefinite, when considered together with other allegations in said paragraph and in said petition, and said allegation should therefore be stricken from the petition." Granting that the allegation so attacked is a conclusion of the pleader, we think that in this regard it is properly pleaded. "Legal results arising from the facts alleged may be pleaded in general terms or in the form of a legal conclusion." Southern States Portland Cement Co. v. Helms, <span class="casemissing">2 Ga. App. 308 (1)</span> (58 S. E. 524). This view is strengthened, we think, by what is said in the first division of this opinion regarding the general demurrer. As to the contention that such allegation is contradictory, vague, and indefinite when considered in connection with the other allegations of the paragraph and of the petition, the demurrer fails to point out wherein or how such allegations are so defective, and it is not apparent to us that they are. A special demurrer must put its finger on the exact point of weakness. A demurrer being a critic must itself be free from imperfections. Southern States Portland Cement Co. v. Helms, supra, p. 314, 316.</div><div class="casepar">4. The third, fourth and fifth grounds of special demurrer attack the allegations of the amendment to the petition relating to the violation of Rule 47 of the agreement between the union and the company upon the ground that it seeks to add a new cause of action not set forth in the original petition; that it injects into the case a violation of a written contract as the basis of the cause of action and that this results in a misjoinder of causes of action in tort and contract, seeks to join in one action a cause of action arising under Federal statutes, and a cause of action arising under the common law and the statutes of the State of Georgia and further upon the ground that the rule is in conflict with the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</div><div class="casepar">We think that the third objection raised by special demurrer is well taken, and that the court erred in refusing to strike these allegations of the petition. An action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act is an exclusive remedy for a party who, by reason of his employment or injury in his employment is entitled to the benefits of the act and for this reason these allegations respecting Rule 47 should have been stricken from the petition.</div><div class="casepar">5. Grounds 10, 11 and 12 of the demurrer attack the allegations of paragraph 7 of the petition as amended, on the ground that the allegations of subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) are mere conclusions of the pleader not borne out by the other facts pleaded, that the allegations are in the alternative, are vague, indefinite, contradictory, and do not put the defendant upon sufficient notice as to what it is called upon to defend; and that subparagraph (b) attempts to add a new cause of action not set forth in the original petition insofar as it complains of the action of a fellow servant. We think that the demurrer attacking these allegations as contradictory and not borne out by the other facts pleaded, should have been sustained. The allegations of these subdivisions are clearly contradictory and inconsistent with each other. If the injury occurred as a result of any one of these conditions or actions so alleged, it clearly did not result at the same time from one or both of the other situations alleged, and if it occurred in one of these three ways and the plaintiff chooses to allege that it did, she should not allege in the same count that because of her inability to ascertain the facts she cannot allege them. As was said in Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Prior, <span class="casemissing">142 Ga. 536</span>, 537 (83 S. E. 117): "Certainty of statement is one of the great aims of pleading; and this can not be attained if the plaintiff in the same count be permitted to base his case upon inconsistent allegations. A defendant is entitled to be informed of the facts upon which the plaintiff bases his action. Where the cause of action arises out of a single transaction, the details of the transaction should not be alleged so as to be contradictory. A plaintiff can not always anticipate what the testimony in a case may develop, and to meet the possible phases of the evidence he may state his cause of action in separate counts." It is clear that no attempt is made by the amendment to set up separate and distinct counts. For these reasons the allegations of paragraph 7 and of the petition as a whole were subject to attack by special demurrer on this ground, and the trial court erred in overruling the ground of the demurrer pointing out this defect and in failing to require the plaintiff to strike these inconsistent and contradictory allegations or to set them up in separate and distinct counts. L. &amp; N. R. Co. v. Shelton, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. App. 295 (1)</span> (93 S. E. 41); Miller v. Southern Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 367</span> (5a) (94 S. E. 619); Kiser v. Pollard, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 697</span> (191 S. E. 179); Jones v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 477</span>, 478 (4) (195 S. E. 879); Girvin v. Georgia Veneer &amp; Package Co., <span class="casemissing">143 Ga. 762 (5)</span> (85 S. E. 922).</div><div class="casepar">6. The final special demurrer attacks the allegations of paragraph 7 as amended relating to the deceased's being in the exercise of ordinary care and not having anticipated the danger and his inability to avoid its consequences, on the ground that the allegations relating thereto are conclusions of the pleader and not borne out by the other facts pleaded in the paragraph and in the petition as a whole. This demurrer is without merit. It does not point out Wherein such allegations are conclusions and not borne out by the facts pleaded, and it is not plain that such criticism is well founded.</div><div class="casepar">The judgment is affirmed upon condition that within ten days from the receipt of the remittitur in the trial court the plaintiff amend her petition so as to remove there from the contradictory and inconsistent allegations as pointed out in division 5 of this opinion, and the irrelevant allegations as pointed out in division 4.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed on condition.
