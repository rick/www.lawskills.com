June 9, 1950.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Special defects or omissions in a pleading may be taken advantage of by special demurrer, and where the same are pointed out by a proper special demurrer, which the court sustains with leave to amend, add the pleader fails to amend to meet the defects so pointed out, the trial court may properly dismiss the petition, as amended, upon renewal of such demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Maud Porter brought suit in the Civil Court of Fulton County against the Prudential Insurance Company of America, in which she sought to recover on a certificate of group life insurance issued by the defendant company to her deceased husband and in which the plaintiff was named as the beneficiary. It was alleged in the petition that such certificate was issued to her husband as an employee of the Atlanta Paper Company, that on September 27, 1949, while said insurance was in effect, her husband died of a heart attack, and that she "requested forms to file application for benefits" under said certificate, and same "were refused her by the defendant," and that the defendant refused to pay the benefits under the certificate. The plaintiff prayed for recovery of the amount of said certificate with penalty and attorney's fees. She attached only a portion of the certificate to the petition. The defendant demurred generally and specially to the plaintiff's petition, demurring specially, among others, upon the ground that it was not alleged how or in what manner the contract of insurance was kept in full force and effect, such allegation in the petition being a conclusion without facts to support the same. the trial judge did not pass upon the general demurrer but sustained the grounds of special demurrer, giving to the plaintiff 20 days in which to amend her petition. Thereupon, the plaintiff amended her petition and alleged that such certificate of insurance was in full force and effect under the "Extension of Death Benefit" clause, which she quoted as follows: "If, while said group policy is in force, any employee, prior to the 60th anniversary of the date of his birth and prior to the termination of his employment is defined in said group policy, and after having been continuously insured under said group policy for at least one year immediately preceding the last day on which he was actively at work, becomes totally disabled as a result of bodily injury or disease so as to be wholly prevented thereby from engaging in any business or occupation and from performing any work for compensation of monetary value or for profit, shall be entitled to the benefits of this certificate hereinafter set forth."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff further amended her petition by alleging that the certificate was still in force when her husband died; that the deceased employee had not reached his 60th birthday; that the deceased had not terminated his employment as defined in said clause (referring to the "Extension of Death Benefit" clause) and that he had been continuously insured under this group policy from the date thereof to his death. The plaintiff further amended her petition by alleging that on September 29, 1949, she requested the forms from a "Mr. Baker of the Atlanta Paper Company" for the purpose of filing her claim for benefits under said certificate; that this person referred the plaintiff to the defendant and she immediately went to the defendant's office in Atlanta and requested such forms from the "person in charge" of the defendant's office; the name of this person being unknown to the plaintiff, and this person referred the plaintiff back to the Atlanta Paper Company "who in turn referred her back" to the defendant company, and that then not knowing what to do, she turned "this claim over to her attorney." This amendment was allowed, subject to demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant renewed its demurrers to the petition, as amended, setting out that the petition as amended did not set out a cause of action against it, and demurring specially to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the petition, as amended, upon the grounds originally urged and also because the allegations thereof are immaterial and set forth no facts tending to substantiate the plaintiff's claim. The defendant further demurred to paragraph 5 of the petition as amended on the grounds that neither the last day on which the insured was actively engaged at work nor the date of the termination of his employment with the Atlanta Paper Company was alleged, and also it is not alleged that the insured died within one year after the termination of his employment with the paper company, nor is it alleged that any notice and proof of the total and permanent disability of the insured was ever furnished in writing to the defendant at its home office.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the petition, as amended, and to this judgment the plaintiff excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> It appears from a copy of the certificate attached to the petition, as amended, that the "Extension of Death Benefits" clause, referred to in said petition, provided as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"(1) For the period of 12 months immediately following the date of such termination of employment insurance under said group policy, without further payment of premium, shall continue in the amount applicable to him in accordance with the plan of insurance under said group policy, but in no event in an amount greater than that for which he was insured on the last day on which he was actively at work; provided, however, that no payment whatever shall be made on account of the death of such employee unless written notice and proof of such death, together with written proof satisfactory to the company that his disability, as aforesaid, continued to the date of his death, and further written proof satisfactory to the company that he had not at any time during such period engaged in any business or occupation or in performance of any work for compensation of monetary value or profit, shall have been received by the company at its home office within one year following the date of such death.</div><div class="casepar">"(2) If such employee shall survive to the end of the aforesaid period of 12 months following such termination of his employment, and (2) shall continue to be totally and permanently disabled and (b) shall not have entered into any occupation or business for compensation of monetary value or for profit, he may, subject to all the provisions herein specified, obtain a continuance of insurance under said group policy commencing on the first anniversary of his termination of employment under said group policy and extending except as hereinafter provided, for a further period of 12 months. In order to obtain continued insurance under this subdivision (2), however, such employee must, within four months prior to the termination of continued insurance provided for under subdivision (1) of this section, furnish to the company at its home office, written proof satisfactory to it of the continuance of his disability, and of the fact that he has not entered into any business or occupation or performed any work for compensation of monetary value or for profit. Notwithstanding the acceptance by the company of proofs of disability, as aforesaid, insurance under this subdivision (2) is subject to the condition that the same shall cease on the 31st day following the earliest one of the following dates: (a) the date of cessation of such total and permanent disability of the employee; (b) the date of his entry into any occupation or business for compensation of monetary value or for profit, whether remaining totally and permanently disabled or not; (c) the date of his failure to submit, upon request, to examination by physicians designated by the company.</div><div class="casepar">"(3) If insurance under said group policy be continued in force, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the second anniversary of such employee's termination of employment, as aforesaid, it may be continued from time to time for further periods of 12 months each, subject to all of the terms, provisions and requirements set forth in subdivision (2) hereof and applicable to the first extension under said subdivision; provided he shall have furnished to the company at its home office within four months prior to the termination of the period of 12 months ending with said anniversary and within four months prior to the termination of each such successive period, proof of continuance of disability in the manner and of the character required by said subdivision (2)."</div><div class="casepar">It, therefore, appears that whether or not the plaintiff's husband had terminated his employment with the paper company at the time of his death and if he had, that the date of the termination of this employment consisted of facts and information which the company was entitled to know under the certificate of insurance. If the deceased had not terminated his employment at the time of his death, then the policy was not in force under the "Extension of Death Benefits" clause, and would necessarily have to be kept in force by the insured by the payment of premiums as provided therein. However, the allegation to the effect that the insured had not terminated his employment when he died is not consistent with the later allegation in the petition as amended that the policy was in force under the "Extension of Death Benefits" clause of the policy, and if the insured in claiming thereunder, instead of that the employment of the insured had not terminated when he died, then compliance with the requirements of this clause under the certificate would have to be shown in order for the plaintiff to be entitled to recover, which would be that the insured died within one year from the termination of his employment and that he was totally disabled at the time of such termination. The date that his employment was terminated was therefore very material and necessary under the provisions of the certificate, and the defendant was entitled to know the same. Such information was not contained in the original petition and the defendant sought by special demurrer to have same set out. Furthermore, the insured, prior to the expiration of four months from the termination of his employment, should have furnished the defendant with proof of his total disability. However, the amendment failed to disclose any of this information, so sought by special demurrer. Also, if the insured survived the first 12 months, and his disability continued and he had not been engaged in any employment for compensation during this time, such policy would remain in force, provided that the insured gave to the defendant company notice and proper proof of these facts, as required therein. Here again the date of the termination of such employment was vitally pertinent, and also the defendant was entitled to know whether or not the insured had made the proof and given the notice, as required. The defendant sought this information by special demurrer, and the same was not forthcoming from the plaintiff in her amendment.</div><div class="casepar">The allegation that the insured had not terminated his employment when he died and the allegation that the policy was in force under the "Extension of Death Benefits" clause are wholly inconsistent and both cannot be true nor relied upon by the plaintiff as showing that the certificate of insurance was in force at the time of the death of her husband, the insured. this rendered the petition, as amended, subject to the demurrers urged.</div><div class="casepar">is to compel the plaintiff to set forth his charge or ground of complaint plainly, fully and distinctly, where he has failed to do so," and while a plaintiff "cannot be required by special demurrer to set forth the evidence by which he expects to prove the allegations made in his petition," he can be compelled by proper special demurrer "to give a plain, distinct and definite statement of issuable and traversable facts, instead of general allegations of liability, or vague, uncertain, or ambiguous recitals." Wrightsville &amp; Tennille R. Co. v. Vaughan, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 371 (2)</span> (71 S. E. 691). The defendant was entitled to know the time of the termination of the employment of the insured with the Atlanta Paper Company if it had been terminated, and a special demurrer to this effect was proper. See Register v. Southern States Phosphate &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">157 Ga. 561</span> (122 S. E. 323). Where proof of disability is a condition precedent to recovery on an insurance policy, as here, and the petition fails to contain any allegation that such proof was made, same should be dismissed on demurrer. See Thigpen v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 405</span> (195 S. E. 591).</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff's petition, as amended, was subject to the grounds of demurrer urged thereto, and the trial court did not err in sustaining the same and dismissing the petition, as amended.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
