Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Langford.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">While engaged in his employment with appellant-employer, appellee-employee suffered a knee injury. Appellee subsequently underwent surgery on his knee and was unable to work for nine months. During that period, appellee received workers' compensation disability benefits. In June of 1981, appellee returned to work and began to perform all of his former duties. Accordingly, his compensation benefits were terminated. Appellee continued to perform all of his former duties although he experienced pain and soreness in doing so. Then, on or about August 14, 1981, appellee's knee gave way and he fell while at work. Appellee was required to seek additional medical treatment for his knee, but apparently continued to perform all of his duties until September of 1981, when he was terminated from his employment for reasons unconnected with his physical condition.</div><div class="casepar">Thereafter, appellee instituted a "change of condition" proceeding, seeking the restoration of his workers' compensation disability benefits. A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) who found, on the above evidence, that appellee had undergone a change of condition as of the date of the termination of his employment with appellant. Because appellee was engaged in part-time work for another employer at the time of the hearing, the ALJ determined that appellee was partially disabled and should be awarded compensation benefits pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/262/index.html">34-9-262</a></span> (Code Ann.  114-405). On his own motion, the ALJ also ordered a change in appellee's physician. After a de novo hearing, the full board adopted the award of the ALJ. On appeal to the superior court, the award to appellee was affirmed. Appellant's application to this court for a discretionary appeal was granted.</div><div class="casepar">1. Pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/102/index.html">34-9-102</a></span> (e)(2) (Code Ann.  114-707), appellee introduced at the hearing certain medical reports which had been signed by a physician. Pursuant to the same statute, appellant invoked its right of cross-examination and gave notice that the physician whose signature appeared on the reports would be deposed. Appellee personally appeared at the scheduled deposition, along with his attorney. However, the physician who was to be deposed refused to testify in the presence of appellee. Appellee insisted that he had the right to be present during the physician's deposition and that, if that right would not be afforded, neither he nor his counsel would attend the deposition. The only response of appellant's counsel was to state his intention of "going forward" with the deposition regardless of the presence or the absence of appellee and his counsel. After appellee and his counsel left, the deposition of the physician was taken by appellant's counsel and then submitted to the ALJ. Appellee objected to the ALJ's consideration of the deposition in making the award. The objection was sustained and the ALJ did not consider the deposition. The full board likewise refused to consider the deposition, and the superior court, in its order affirming the award, specifically held that the evidence was properly excluded. On appeal to this court, appellant asserts that the deposition was erroneously excluded from consideration.</div><div class="casepar">The discovery procedure in workers' compensation cases is governed and controlled by the Civil Practice Act (CPA). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/102/index.html">34-9-102</a></span> (d)(1) (Code Ann.  114-707). Under the CPA, one clearly has the right to attend a deposition which is being taken for use in a case in which he is a party. "[W]hen a deposition is taken . . ., the opposing party or his counsel have the right to be present. The exclusion of [a party] and [his] counsel from the taking of the deposition . . . would void the procedure, if otherwise valid." Reynolds v. Reynolds, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../166/04/index.html">217 Ga. 234</a></span>, 245 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../166/04/index.html">123 SE2d 115</a></span>) (1961) (construing former Code Ann.  38-2101 et seq.), overruled on other grounds, Scherer v. Scherer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../713/7/index.html">249 Ga. 635</a></span>, 640 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../713/7/index.html">292 SE2d 662</a></span>) (1982).</div><div class="casepar">It is true that, in the instant case, appellee was not excluded from attending the deposition by the direct actions of appellant's counsel. Instead, appellee's absence was the direct result of the unwarranted recalcitrance of the deponent. However, we do not believe that this fact alone would legitimate an otherwise "void" procedure and authorize appellant's counsel to proceed with the deposition in the absence of appellee. If the prospective deponent could not be convinced to give his testimony while appellee was present, there were remedies available to appellant by which to secure the enforcement of its right to depose the physician in a manner that would not "void" the entire procedure. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/102/index.html">34-9-102</a></span> (d)(2) (Code Ann.  114-707), <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/37/index.html">9-11-37</a></span> (Code Ann.  81A-137). Appellant chose not to do so, opting instead to depose a witness who agreed to testify only in contravention of appellee's right to be present. The result of appellant's election to proceed in appellee's absence was to void a procedure which would otherwise have been valid under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/102/index.html">34-9-102</a></span> (e)(2) (Code Ann.  114-707). See Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Crews, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../568/55/index.html">139 Ga. App. 521 (229 SE2d 14) (1976)</a></span>; Rachel v. Simmons Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../560/46/index.html">141 Ga. App. 236 (233 SE2d 56) (1977)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The deposition was not erroneously excluded from consideration in making the award to appellee.</div><div class="casepar">2. Appellant asserts that the award to appellee was predicated upon an erroneous legal theory and that the facts as found by the ALJ did not authorize the award. The relevant portions of the ALJ's award, as adopted by the full board, are as follows: "After careful consideration of all the evidence I conclude and find as fact [appellee] had not been cured nor had he recovered from the left knee injury when he was terminated on September 24, 1981. [Appellee] was working at his old winch-truck operator job with great effort and while in pain was being paid the same wages as prior to injury, however, when [appellant] terminated [appellee] he was entitled to have his weekly income benefits reinstated under these facts. See Beachamp v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, et al., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/90/index.html">112 Ga. App. 417</a></span>. [(<span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/90/index.html">145 SE2d 605</a></span>) (1965)]." (R-165)</div><div class="casepar">The Beachamp decision, cited as the authority for the award made to appellee, does in fact hold that " [d]ischarge for . . . cause after an employee has become disabled and returned to work does not in our opinion justify denial of compensation. [Cits.] . . . [It is] an erroneous legal theory, that when an employee following a disabling injury returns to work and then is discharged for a cause unrelated to the injury he is not entitled to compensation as a matter of law." (Emphasis supplied.) Beachamp v. Aetna Cas. &amp;c. Co., supra at 418. However, Beachamp does not stand for the proposition that an employee who was formerly disabled but who has since returned to work is automatically entitled to receive an award of compensation upon the subsequent termination of his employment. "If the employment was covered by the [Workers'] Compensation Act, the question remains whether the employee's injury sustained during the course of the employment caused him to be disabled to any extent, in order words, whether it caused a loss of earning capacity." Beachamp v. Aetna Cas. &amp;c. Co., supra at 418. Accordingly, the dispositive issue in the instant case was whether appellee suffered a loss of earning capacity as the result of an injury sustained while in appellant's employment.</div><div class="casepar">Appellee sought disability benefits because of a change in his condition. A " 'change of condition' means a change in the wage-earning capacity, physical condition, or status of an employee . . ., which change must have occurred after the date on which the wage-earning capacity, physical condition or status of the employee . . . was last established by award or otherwise." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/104/index.html">34-9-104</a></span> (a) (Code Ann.  114-709). Upon the showing of a change of condition, the board may render a decision "ending, decreasing, increasing, or authorizing the recovery of income benefits awarded or ordered in the prior final decision . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/34/9/104/index.html">34-9-104</a></span> (b) (Code Ann.  114-709). Where an employer seeks to end disability income benefits pursuant to the above statutory provision or where, as here, an employee seeks a resumption of those benefits, the only relevant "change of condition" is a change in the employee's "wage-earning capacity," not in his physical condition. See Peterson/Puritan, Inc. v. Day, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../502/96/index.html">157 Ga. App. 827 (278 SE2d 674) (1981)</a></span>. This is true because the only relevant issue in determining whether an employee is entitled to disability income benefits as the result of an employment-related accident is whether he has suffered an impairment of his earning capacity as the result of the accident, not whether he has suffered physically. See Hensel Phelps Constr. Co. v. Manigault, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../462/37/index.html">167 Ga. App. 599 (307 SE2d 79) (1983)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Therefore, the mere fact that appellee was experiencing physical pain while fully performing his job for appellant does not support a finding that he had suffered a change of condition for purposes of receiving income disability benefits. "Inasmuch as the element of pain and suffering, or increased discomfort or difficulty in performing the duties after an injury is not taken into consideration by the [Workers'] Compensation Act ([cit.]), the claimant's . . . injuries in and of themselves would not require a finding that there had been any change in condition which would authorize a payment of compensation for a loss of earning capacity. [Cit.]" Hall v. St. Paul-Mercury Indem. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/10/index.html">96 Ga. App. 567</a></span>, 569-570 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/10/index.html">101 SE2d 94</a></span>) (1957). Nor would the mere fact that appellee was no longer employed by appellant, having been terminated for cause, authorize a finding that he was entitled to a resumption of income disability benefits. Under the facts of the instant case, the burden was on appellee to show that, after his termination for cause, his inability to secure suitable employment elsewhere was proximately caused by his previous accidental injury." Hartford Acc. &amp;c. Co. v. Bristol, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../921/0/index.html">242 Ga. 287</a></span>, 288 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../921/0/index.html">248 SE2d 661</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">It is unclear from the ALJ's findings exactly what served as the basis for the award of a resumption of disability benefits to appellee. Apparently, it was the ALJ's interpretation of the Beachamp decision as authority for the proposition that an employee who has returned to full employment but who is suffering physical pain from a previous compensable injury is, ipso facto, entitled to a resumption of disability income benefits when his employment is terminated for cause. If this interpretation of Beachamp was the basis of the ALJ's decision, the award was predicated upon an erroneous legal theory. As noted above, an employee who has returned to work and who no longer receives compensation benefits is not entitled to a resumption of those benefits after termination for cause unless he has subsequently suffered an economic change in condition. The requisite economic change in condition exists when the employee is able to demonstrate that, as a proximate result of his previous work related injury, he is unable to secure suitable employment elsewhere. Hartford Acc. &amp;c. Co. v. Bristol, supra. The correct interpretation of the holding in Beachamp is that "when an employee is still suffering from a work related disability and is terminated even for just cause, if because of his disability, he is unable to find employment, he is entitled to have his income benefits reinstated. [Cits.]" (Emphasis supplied.) Mills v. Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../488/77/index.html">160 Ga. App. 349</a></span>, 352 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../488/77/index.html">287 SE2d 41 (1981)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">If, on the other hand, the ALJ intended to base the award of disability benefits upon the correct legal theory, the findings which were actually made would not authorize a resumption of appellee's benefits. The ALJ's findings relate solely to the fact that appellee was experiencing physical pain in the performance of his job at the time he was terminated for cause. Although appellee may have been experiencing such pain at the time he was terminated, he would not be entitled to a resumption of income disability benefits unless the proximate cause of his inability to secure employment elsewhere was his originally compensable knee injury. Hartford Acc. &amp;c. Co. v. Bristol, supra; Mills v. Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, supra. The award makes no findings whatsoever with regard to whether appellee's inability to secure other than part-time employment after he was terminated by appellant was the result of the knee injury he suffered while in appellant's employment.</div><div class="casepar">The superior court erred in affirming the award and in failing to return the case to the full board so that appropriate findings based upon the correct legal theory of "change of condition" might be made. See Outler v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../520/36/index.html">152 Ga. App. 424 (263 SE2d 230) (1979)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, even if a request for a change of physicians had been made by appellee, it does not appear from the record before us that appellant was given the requisite 10-day notice within which to file its objections. Accordingly, for this additional reason the ALJ lacked the authority to order a change in appellee's physicians and the superior court erred in affirming the award in this regard. City of Acworth v. Williams, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../482/36/index.html">162 Ga. App. 694 (293 SE2d 352) (1982)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. Remaining enumerations of error, not otherwise addressed, are rendered moot by our reversal of the judgment for the reasons stated.</div><div class="casepar">5. The order affirming the award is reversed with direction that the case be remanded to the board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Sandra K.
