Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Whitman.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, Chief Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Although the compensation agreement precluded the employer and insurer from later contradicting the fact stipulated therein--that the initial disability resulted from a compensable back injury--they were not precluded by the agreement nor estopped by their failure to appeal from the board's approval thereof (for which there is no provision of law) from showing, on a hearing based on change of condition, that admissability resulting from the injury had terminated and that whatever disability then existed was caused by a non-compensable disease. The case is to be remanded to the board for further findings based upon a consideration of all of the evidence in the light of correct and applicable legal principles, as set forth in the opinion.</div><div class="casepar">An agreement to pay compensation was entered into between the parties and approved by the board on November 15, 1963, which stipulated that claimant sustained a back injury on August 28, 1963, caused by bumping his back. Compensation payment commenced on September 4, 1963. On January 6, 1964, the employer and insurer requested a hearing based on change in condition.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. William W. Moore, neuro-surgeon, testified: that he saw the claimant on September 25, October 15, October 29 and November 5, 1963, supervised his treatment at Crawford Long Hospital from November 17 to December 13, 1963, and saw him again on January 2 and 23, 1964; that on September 25 he evaluated the claimant's complaints of back and leg pain and found no neurological abnormalities, although claimant had only about 25% range of motion in his back; that on October 29 he found the claimant to have a 70% range of motion of his back with no abnormalities of nerve function but tenderness in the upper part of his back; that on November 5 he had an 80% range of motion, but also back pain, nausea and sensitivity of the sciatic nerve and was admitted to Crawford Long Hospital for a thorough examination, where myelogram and x-rays showed no mechanical reason for the nerve pain; that on December 4, 1963, he performed a laminectomy, exploring the disc spaces between the 4th and 5th lumbar and 5th lumbar and 1st sacral vertebrae, and found no abnormalities, but that after surgery the claimant continued to have a virtually unchanged degree of pain; that he called in Dr. Furst, whose tests revealed that the claimant had diabetes mellitus, for which he was treated medically; that he does not know and has no opinion as to whether the claimant's pain might be due to involvement of his nerves by diabetes; that, while he found no evidence of abnormality in the spine and nerves examined which caused the pain, it is possible for the nucleus pulposus to rupture and compress the nerves within the spine without showing on plain x-rays as well as without showing 10% to 15% of myelograms; that on January 23 he found the claimant's general condition to have been largely unchanged from the time he first saw him, although the range of motion in his back had improved from approximately 25% to approximately 80%.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Stephen E. Furst testified: that he saw the claimant on December 10, 1963, at Crawford Long Hospital at the request of Dr. Moore that on the basis of examination, he found him to have a mild degree of diabetes mellitus; that within the last two years it has been medicinally reported that an inflammation of the sciatic nerves can occur in diabetes before any sign of diabetes, although it is unusual to see symptoms of this severity caused by a mild degree of diabetes mellitus; that he treated him medically for diabetes up until January 23, 1964; that, while diabetes may be produced in a person by a trauma, he found nothing in the history to indicate the sort of blow that would cause this condition; that claimant's condition could have been caused by diabetes, but that he couldn't state unequivocally that it was; that he found nothing else in his examinations to explain the condition, although the same pattern of pain could result from a specific injury to the spine.</div><div class="casepar">After setting forth the above evidence, the deputy director made the following findings of fact: "Claimant has undergone no significant change in his physical condition since Agreement to Pay Compensation was approved November 15, 1963, and remains temporarily totally disabled. Defendants have submitted evidence which supports, but does not demand, a finding that claimant's sciatic nerve pains are the result of diabetes instead of industrial accident. This evidence was available for its use in an appeal within thirty days from the Award of the Board approving the Agreement to Pay Compensation. Under the rule set out in 105 Ga. Appeals, page 723, a change in diagnosis from one showing a compensable injury to one showing a non-compensable injury does not amount to evidence of change of condition." The deputy director's findings of fact and award in favor of the claimant were adopted by the full board and affirmed by the superior court on appeal, to which judgment the employer and its insurer except.</div><div class="casepar">The fact that compensation was paid on the original injury, however, does not preclude the employer and insurer from contending that the present disability did not stem from the original injury. Pepperell Mfg. Co. v. Mathis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../700/58/index.html">92 Ga. App. 85 (58 SE2d 201)</a></span>; Roberts v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../699/07/index.html">93 Ga. App. 440</a></span>, 441 (1) (92, SE2d 51). The change of condition which Code Ann.  114-709 provides may authorize an award ending the compensation previously agreed upon, then, may consist of a change in the cause of the claimant's disability since the original agreement, although the physical condition may remain largely unchanged.</div><div class="casepar">The award of the board indicates that it was based upon the rule set forth in the case of Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v. Sheets, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../671/18/index.html">105 Ga. App. 734 (125 SE2d 569)</a></span>, to the effect that a change in diagnosis from one showing a compensable injury to one showing a non-compensable injury does not amount to evidence of change of condition. In that case the doctor who made the original examination changed his diagnosis after the agreement was signed and approved by the board, in effect merely changing his mind as to the cause of the injury. In the instant case, however, there was evidence of the termination of disability caused by the initial work-related injury and a change in condition accompanied by lesser disability due to the subsequent, non-work-related disease of diabetes mellitus. The rule of the Sheets case is therefore not controlling in the present case.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, the statement in the award, to the effect that the defendants' evidence was available for its use in an appeal within 30 days from the award of the board approving the compensation agreement, indicates the board's reliance upon an additional erroneous legal theory. The evidence available to the defendants was not inconsistent with the cause of the initial injury as established by the agreement, i.e., a bumping of the claimant's back, but indicated, as we have held, that disability was subsequently caused by the disease rather than by the back injury. It follows from this that the defendants' failure to appeal from the award approving the agreement (assuming that the law provides for such an appeal, which it does not) would not operate as an estoppel for their later application for a hearing based upon a change in condition, at which they might present whatever evidence was available to them that the cause of the disability had changed subsequently to the date of the execution of the agreement.</div><div class="casepar">When it affirmatively appears that an award of the board is based upon an erroneous legal theory, and that for this reason the board has not considered all of the evidence in the light of correct and applicable legal principles, the case should be remanded to the board for further findings. Barbree v. Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../669/76/index.html">105 Ga. App. 186 (123 SE2d 905)</a></span>; Miller v. Travelers Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/11/index.html">111 Ga. App. 245 (141 SE2d 223)</a></span>. Since it affirmatively appears that the award was based upon an erroneous legal theory, the judgment of the superior court affirming the award of the board is reversed with direction that the case be remanded to the board for action in accordance with what is stated in this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed with direction.
