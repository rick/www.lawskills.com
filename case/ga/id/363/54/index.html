"The standard employed in the trial judge's ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal is thrice removed, it might be said, from probable cause -- as 'beyond a reasonable doubt' is more than 'clear and convincing evidence,' which is more than 'preponderance of the evidence,' which, in turn, is more than mere 'probable cause.' When the trial judge, having heard all of the [S]tate's evidence, considers a motion on behalf of an accused (the accused being present and given an opportunity to be heard in support of the motion); and when the trial judge rules that the evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction (that is, is sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact[, that being the trial court in this case,] to find each and every element of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt), we can see no reason why such a holding -- unreversed and in the absence of fraud or corruption -- should not suffice as to the existence of probable cause.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/20/index.html">51-7-20</a></span>. In an action to recover damages for illegal arrest or false imprisonment the only essential elements are the arrest or detention and the unlawfulness thereof.

"This is true because probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed may otherwise exist and a warrantless arrest yet be illegal. . . . [T]he defendant in a false imprisonment case premised upon a warrantless arrest does not meet his defensive burden merely by demonstrating the existence of probable cause but he must go further and show that the arrest was also effectuated pursuant to one of the 'exigent circumstances' enumerated in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/4/20/index.html">17-4-20</a></span> (a) [or  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/4/60/index.html">17-4-60</a></span>].

Appellants were "arrested by [appellees'] agent [, an off-duty police officer who was working as a security guard,] within whose presence [appellants] appeared to have [committed criminal trespass]. [Cit.] An arrest (of an offender) by a private person [or a law enforcement officer] where the offense is committed in his presence is a lawful arrest.

App. 670</a></span>, 672 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../418/85/index.html">347 SE2d 619</a></span>) (1986). See also Stover v. Atchley, <span class="casemissing">189 Ga.

The evidence shows that appellants were "touched" only in connection with their arrests. Accordingly, unless a genuine issue of material fact remains as to the unlawfulness of such touchings, the grant of summary judgment as to appellants' battery claims was proper.</div><div class="casepar">As to the arrests of appellants by appellees' security guard, not only has probable cause been established, but also "[t]he evidence shows that there was no use of, nor threat of excessive force. [Cit.] A prima facie showing having been made that [appellees were] entitled to judgment as a matter of law, [appellants were] required to come forward with rebuttal evidence to sustain [their] allegations of . . . battery, but failed to do so.

The on-duty policemen were not appellees' agents. They were the official agents of the State. A private citizen's mere request that an arrest be made does not render an on-duty policeman the citizen's agent. The requisite control of the officer's actions by the private citizen is not present.

Monroe v. Sigler, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../557/1/index.html">256 Ga. 759 (353 SE2d 23) (1987)</a></span> is not controlling in the circumstances of this litigation on the claim of malicious prosecution. One of the elements of this cause of action is that the criminal prosecution by defendant was without probable cause. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/40/index.html">51-7-40</a></span>; J. C. Penney Co., Inc. v. Miller, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/79/index.html">182 Ga. App. 64</a></span>, 66 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/79/index.html">354 SE2d 682</a></span>) (1987). As quoted in Monroe, supra at 760, plaintiff must show " 'that under the facts as they appeared to the prosecutor at the time of the prosecution, . . . the defendant . . . could have no reasonable grounds for believing the plaintiff to be guilty of the charge brought.' " OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/43/index.html">51-7-43</a></span> defines it: "Lack of probable cause shall exist when the circumstances are such as to satisfy a reasonable man that the accuser had no ground for proceeding but his desire to injure the accused." The Code section goes on to instruct: "Lack of probable cause shall be a question for the jury, under the direction of the court."</div><div class="casepar">In Monroe, the Supreme Court answered affirmatively "whether a judicial determination of probable cause made in the course of a criminal prosecution can establish, as a matter of law and for purposes of summary judgment, the existence of probable cause in the civil action for malicious prosecution." According to the Supreme Court's analysis, the reason the judicial determination serves to negate a later civil claim of lack of probable cause is that if a judge considers the evidence sufficient to support a jury's conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it certainly reaches the lesser quantum needed to support probable cause. In the civil context, reasonable men and women on the jury would have to decide whether the preponderating evidence is that a reasonable man or woman under the circumstances of the case before them could have had, at the time of the prosecution, no reasonable grounds for believing plaintiffs to be guilty of the criminal charge brought. Monroe, supra at 760. In Monroe, the significance of the action of the trial court was buttressed by the separate determinations of two magistrates, a factor absent here.</div><div class="casepar">In the instant case, the trials for criminal trespass (knowingly and without authority remaining on the premises of another after notice to depart, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/7/21/index.html">16-7-21</a></span> (b) (3)) were before the court without a jury. Thus there was no proper motion for directed verdict, as the law does not provide for such in a bench trial because a verdict is the decision of a jury. Smith v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../688/29/index.html">98 Ga. App. 840</a></span>, 841-842 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../688/29/index.html">107 SE2d 334</a></span>) (1959); see American Appraisal Co. v. Whitley Construction Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../608/72/index.html">126 Ga. App. 398</a></span>, 399 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../608/72/index.html">190 SE2d 838</a></span>) (1972). Only since 1971 has the law of Georgia again recognized motions for directed verdict in criminal cases. Ga. L. 1971, p. 460 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/9/1/index.html">17-9-1</a></span>, as amended Ga. L. 1982, p. 3). It was in demise for a period prior to that. See Pritchard v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/63/index.html">224 Ga. 776</a></span>, 779 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/63/index.html">164 SE2d 808</a></span>) (1968); Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/39/index.html">228 Ga. 859</a></span>, 860 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/39/index.html">188 SE2d 793</a></span>) (1972). The appeal in State v. White, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../547/13/index.html">145 Ga. App. 730 (244 SE2d 579) (1978)</a></span>, cited by the majority, was dismissed inasmuch as the state has no right to appeal from a judgment of acquittal which, rightly or wrongly, the trial court had entered because the state failed and refused to put on any evidence.</div><div class="casepar">Nor could the motion have been treated as a motion for involuntary dismissal so as to have accomplished the defendants' goal in what was a jury-less trial, because the law provides for such only in civil cases. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/41/index.html">9-11-41</a></span> (b); State v. Cooperman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../539/05/index.html">147 Ga. App. 556</a></span>, 558 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../539/05/index.html">249 SE2d 358</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">There is no mechanism for the defendant to test the sufficiency of the State's evidence in a criminal bench trial before electing whether to submit defense evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The question remains whether the Monroe rationale applies to the criminal trial judge's action in this case. That is, was his so-called denial of acquittal on motion after the State's evidence was presented based on a judicial determination that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt? The answer is "no."</div><div class="casepar">The focus of the argument and the court's explanation related to the elements of criminal trespass as it had been charged. The court was uncertain, because of the lack of legal precedent, whether the two movie patrons who were in the theater with their purchased tickets, which tickets contained no express reservation of right to eject, had a legal right to remain despite the owner's demand that they leave because of conduct which allegedly occurred before entry. It was asserted that they broke in line outside the theater.</div><div class="casepar">The court noted that they were not charged with entering after receiving notice that entry was forbidden, which is prohibited by subsection (2), but only with violation of subsection (3). The court indicated that if the patrons had a legal right to remain, they obviously could not be guilty of criminal trespass for refusing to leave.</div><div class="casepar">Thus it was the unresolved legal question of whether the contract to see the movie on the premises, which contract was evidenced by the movie tickets, gave the patrons the right to refuse to obey the demand that they depart, which prompted the court to deny the motion for acquittal. The denial of the motion, then, does not conclusively establish that there was a judicial determination that the movie theater owner and employee had probable cause to believe, at the time they prosecuted, that the patrons had committed criminal trespass when they refused to depart. The court acknowledged its uncertainty concerning whether criminal trespass was precluded as a matter of law because of the tickets and that part of the evidence which was undisputed, so there was no foundation upon which a firm determination of sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt or even probable cause could be made.</div><div class="casepar">This crucial distinction differs this case from even the logic of Monroe v. Sigler and further makes its rule inapplicable. The judge could not have concluded that there was sufficient evidence "to enable a rational trier of fact to find each and every element of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt," Griffin v. Georgia Power Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../393/66/index.html">186 Ga. App. 565</a></span>, 566 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../393/66/index.html">367 SE2d 832</a></span>) (1988), because he was unsure of the legal ramifications of the accused trespassers' contract.</div><div class="casepar">As to the other elements, the civil case defendants concede that the criminal prosecution was ultimately terminated in plaintiffs' favor, and there was some evidence of malice as that is set out in Melton v. LaCalamito, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../499/03/index.html">158 Ga. App. 820 (282 SE2d 393) (1981)</a></span>. The criminal trial judge even commented on the courtroom demeanor of the theater's agent and had to express his dissatisfaction with his conduct during trial.</div><div class="casepar">2. There being questions of fact and law regarding whether plaintiffs had committed criminal trespass when they were arrested in the theater and handcuffed with their hands behind their backs and thereby restrained, summary judgment is premature on the claim of false imprisonment. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/20/index.html">51-7-20</a></span>. Defendants have not shown as a matter of law, by undisputed facts, that it was lawful to detain the patrons from viewing the movie and arrest them. This is their burden. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span>; Bowman v. U. S. Life Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../462/54/index.html">167 Ga. App. 673 (307 SE2d 134) (1983)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. It has not been established as a matter of law that there was no unlawful touching which would be actionable as a battery. Newsome v. Cooper-Wiss, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../418/85/index.html">179 Ga. App. 670</a></span>, 672 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../418/85/index.html">347 SE2d 619</a></span>) (1986). The security guard frisked the male patron, led him by the arm, and handcuffed him as well as his pregnant wife. Whether this was justified touching or the use of excessive force is a jury question. See Thompson v. Shelverton, <span class="casemissing">131 Ga. 714 (63 SE 220) (1908)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. There being no reference to record or transcript pages indicating that appellees raised, or the court ruled on, a statute of limitation defense, see Rule 15 (c) (3), the parties' final arguments present nothing for this court to rule on.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Judge Benham joins in this dissent.</div><div class="casepar">R.
