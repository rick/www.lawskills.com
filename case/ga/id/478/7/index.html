Before Judge Castellani.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Larry Grant Lonchar was convicted by a jury in DeKalb County of three counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. He was sentenced to death on each of the murder counts. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. Charles Wayne Smith and his son, Steven Smith, ran a book-making operation out of a condominium in DeKalb County. Lonchar became several thousand dollars in debt to the operation, and on October 13, 1986, visited the condominium, accompanied by Mitchell Wells. At the time they visited, four people were in the condominium. The three murder victims, Wayne Smith, Steven Smith, and Wayne's companion, Margaret Sweat, were in the living room. Richard Smith (another of Wayne Smith's sons), the aggravated assault victim, was in a bedroom. At trial Richard Smith testified that he heard a knock on the door and then saw Lonchar enter the living room. He added that Lonchar displayed a badge and identified himself as special agent Larry Lonchar. Wayne Smith and Steven Smith were then handcuffed.</div><div class="casepar">Richard Smith heard four or five shots from the living room, and then Wells came to his bedroom, shot him several times and left. He pretended he was dead while the condominium was ransacked. Shortly thereafter, afraid he would bleed to death, he picked up the extension telephone in the bedroom and heard Sweat talking to the police. Then she yelled, "they're back." Richard Smith crawled to the living room and saw a man wearing a trench coat leave the condominium.</div><div class="casepar">Sweat's call was recorded by the police department:</div><div class="casepar">911: DeKalb Emergency 911.</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Police.</div><div class="casepar">911: What address?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: []</div><div class="casepar">911: What's the problem?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Everybody's been shot.</div><div class="casepar">911: Who's been shot?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Me -- and --</div><div class="casepar">911: With a gun?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Yes.</div><div class="casepar">911: Who did it?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: I don't know.</div><div class="casepar">911: Is that a house or an apartment?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: It's a condominium. . . .</div><div class="casepar">911: Okay. Now you say everybody's been shot, I already got you help on the way, but when you say everybody's been shot, how many?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Uh, me.</div><div class="casepar">911: Where are you shot at?</div><div class="casepar">Caller: In the living room -- I've crawled to the phone.</div><div class="casepar">911: I mean what part of your body, Ma'am.</div><div class="casepar">Caller: I think my stomach they're coming back in -- please -- (inaudible)</div><div class="casepar">911: Who did it? Give me a description of them!</div><div class="casepar">Caller: Why are you doing this. Please -- (inaudible).</div><div class="casepar">Please, please, I don't even know your name. Please -- please Larry. I don't even know your n --.</div><div class="casepar">Wayne Smith was shot in the chest, the back, and the head. Steven Smith was shot in the chest and in the head. Margaret Sweat was shot in the shoulder, stabbed in the neck 17 times, and stabbed in the chest three times. Richard Smith was shot in the back and was grazed on his head. Of the four occupants of the condominium, he was the only survivor.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Contrary to Lonchar's contention, the trial court did not err by instructing the jury both on parties to a crime as defined in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/2/20/index.html">16-2-20</a></span> and on the law of conspiracy in its evidentiary sense. Thomas v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../561/3/index.html">255 Ga. 38 (2) (334 SE2d 675) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Lonchar contends it was error to instruct the jury on felony murder as well as malice murder where the indictment charged only the latter. See Crawford v. State, <span class="casemissing">254 Ga. 435 (1) (330 SE2d 567) (1985)</span>. The state contends the indictment sufficiently alleged both. The jury was given a verdict form requiring it to specify as to each murder count of the indictment whether Lonchar was guilty of malice murder, guilty of felony murder, or not guilty. See Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../617/7/index.html">253 Ga. 390</a></span>, 395 (fn. 3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../617/7/index.html">321 SE2d 710</a></span>) (1984). Since the jury specifically found Lonchar guilty of "malice murder" on each count, any issue of felony murder is moot. Holiday v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../476/8/index.html">258 Ga. 393 (12)</a></span> (____ SE2d ____) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">(c) The evidence shows that Lonchar himself shot three people, one of whom he also stabbed to death, and was a party to all of the criminal events occurring inside the Smith condominium. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> His conviction on all counts is supported by the evidence. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">2. Before the voir dire began, Lonchar's attorney informed the court that Lonchar wished to absent himself from the trial as soon as the jury was selected. The attorney stated he had advised Lonchar against such a move, but that was Lonchar's desire nonetheless. The court adjourned to its chambers, and discussed the matter with Lonchar and his attorney, outside the presence of the state's attorneys. Lonchar stated to the court that he did not have a case, that the outcome was a foregone conclusion, and that he had not been assisting his attorney anyway. He stated further:</div><div class="casepar">I just repeat the way I feel, you know. My presence is irrelevant. And like I say, I haven't been assisting [my attorney] and I am not going to start assisting him, and I am asking, you know, like I say, I realize at times I will have to be present. I realize that and I will cooperate. But as far as, you -- I have read that the law says once the jury is impaneled that I don't have to be present, you know. I don't want to cause a scene where you have to handcuff me and chain me to the seat and gag me and all that. However, I feel, you know, if that is my only alternative, then I will, I mean, that is what I am asking, you know to avoid all of this, you know. I know what is going to happen in this case and, you know, there is nothing I can do about it . . .</div><div class="casepar">Lonchar stated that he understood his right to assist his attorney and present evidence but that he was "just being realistic . . . I have no case, Your Honor . . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The court stated:</div><div class="casepar">I will give him a chance to think about it. Obviously, I do want him during the voir dire which may take some period of time, and . . . at that point I will reconsider it and I will ask him to reconsider.</div><div class="casepar">After the jury was selected, the court addressed the defendant as follows:</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: Mr. Lonchar.</div><div class="casepar">MR. LEIPOLD: Stand up.</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: You recall the discussion that we had yesterday morning, sir?</div><div class="casepar">MR. LONCHAR: Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: You will recall both the Court's request and your attorney's request that you remain in the courtroom, but that I told you that that was the decision that I would probably allow you to make. I wanted you to sit through the voir dire process and I wanted you to have an opportunity to reconsider that issue.</div><div class="casepar">I am going to allow you, if you wish, to withdraw yourself during those parts of the trial that you think is -- that you want to be excused from, if you wish to do so. I want to advise you, however, that, obviously, you would not be here, first of all, to assist your attorney in responding to questions and certainly you would not be here to evaluate what it is that your attorney does in your behalf. If you want to voluntarily give up those rights that you are, in fact, giving up a very valuable right that you have, and I am sure Mr. Leipold is going to do an excellent job, do the best possible job that he can do on your behalf, there is no question about that. There is, however, no question that it is always better to have your client with you in court, both for strategic purposes and also for information purposes. Mr. Lonchar do you understand what I am telling you?</div><div class="casepar">MR. LONCHAR: Yes.</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: Now are you telling me that you still want to be absent from certain parts of the trial?</div><div class="casepar">MR. LONCHAR: Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: Do you understand that there may be certain parts of the trial which I will have to direct that you be here, for identification and for certain other purposes, do you understand that?</div><div class="casepar">MR. LONCHAR: Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">THE COURT: All right, sir. I will at any time give you the opportunity to come back into Court whenever you wish to come back into Court and I will do whatever is necessary to facilitate your re-entry back into Court out of the presence of the jury. So, you can come back in whenever you'd like. Do you understand that, Mr. Lonchar?</div><div class="casepar">MR. LONCHAR: Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">Periodically throughout the trial, the court asked the defendant if he wanted to return to the courtroom for the remainder of the trial. Lonchar declined, and except for a few brief instances in which he was returned to the courtroom to be identified by a witness, the guilt-phase evidence was presented in his absence. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(a) A criminal defendant "is guaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure." Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U. S. ____ (107 SC 2658, 2667, 96 LE2d 631) (1987). In the case of non-custodial defendants, the defendant can waive his right to be present by voluntarily absenting himself. Taylor v. United States, 414 U. S. 17 (94 SC 194, 38 LE2d 174) (1973). A defendant in custody can lose his right to be present by disruptive behavior. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337 (90 SC 1057, 25 LE2d 353) (1970).</div><div class="casepar">Lonchar relies on our recent observation in Tieu v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../508/7/index.html">257 Ga. 281</a></span>, 284 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../508/7/index.html">358 SE2d 247</a></span>) (1987), that "it is doubtful that a defendant who has been charged with a capital felony and who is in police custody has the capacity to waive his right to be present at the commencement of the trial." Lonchar, however, unlike Tieu, was present at the commencement of his trial. We have rejected a blanket non-waiver rule for capital defendants in custody. State v. Phillips, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../762/4/index.html">247 Ga. 246 (275 SE2d 323) (1981)</a></span>. We hold that a defendant has a right to be present at his trial, but may waive that right, even in a death-penalty case. See United States v. Crutcher, 405 F2d 239, 243 (2nd Cir. 1968).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Lonchar argues that even if the right may be waived, he was not fully and properly informed of his rights and there was no valid waiver. The trial court, he argues,</div><div class="casepar">did not go into any specific detail on his right to confront witnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, his various due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. . . . Constitution . . . or identification problems that could be created by this situation . . . .</div><div class="casepar">Although the "right to confront witnesses" was not mentioned per se, it is clear from the in-chambers colloquy that Lonchar understood that the state's witnesses would testify in open court. In fact, that is why he chose to absent himself -- he did not want to hear their testimony. It is also clear he understood that his attorney would have the right to ask questions of these witnesses. The court advised him that his absence would mean that he would not be able to assist his attorney in this respect.</div><div class="casepar">We agree with the trial court: Lonchar knew what he was doing, and voluntarily absented himself from the trial. He had a right to do so, and the court's ruling was not error.</div><div class="casepar">3. The court's death-qualification rulings were not erroneous. Pope v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/9/index.html">256 Ga. 195 (7) (345 SE2d 831) (1986)</a></span>; Alderman v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../586/9/index.html">254 Ga. 206 (4) (327 SE2d 168) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. Lonchar moved for mistrial when a law officer testified, unresponsively, that the person with whom Lonchar was staying in Texas was a "local drug dealer." The trial court rebuked the witness and instructed the jury to disregard the remark, but denied the motion for mistrial. There was no abuse of discretion. Sabel v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../689/7/index.html">250 Ga. 640 (5) (300 SE2d 663) (1983)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">5. Lonchar contends the court erred by not declaring a mistrial when the alternate jurors deliberated with the regular jury at the sentencing phase of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">As provided by law, the alternate jurors were kept with the jury during the trial of the guilt phase of the case. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/170/index.html">15-12-170</a></span>. When the case was presented to the jury for deliberation on the issue of guilt, the alternates were separated from the jury until the jury reached its verdict, as required by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/171/index.html">15-12-171</a></span>. After the verdict of guilty was published, the court recessed for the evening, and the jurors went home. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> The next day, the alternates remained with the jury during the sentencing phase of the trial until the case was again presented to the jury for deliberation, when they were again separated from the regular jury. At no time during the actual deliberations were the alternate jurors with the jury. Especially in view of the trial court's many admonitions during the trial that the jurors should not discuss the case with each other nor begin deliberations until instructed to do so, no violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/171/index.html">15-12-171</a></span> has been shown. There is no requirement that alternate jurors in a death penalty case be excused once the jury has rendered a verdict as to guilt, and no need to keep them separate when the jury is not deliberating.</div><div class="casepar">6. The state was not precluded from urging the presence of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (2) and (b) (7) simply because aggravated battery is a fact supporting both circumstances. Parks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../593/8/index.html">254 Ga. 403 (16) (330 SE2d 686) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. The prosecutor did not express a personal opinion during his closing argument. Compare Ford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../563/1/index.html">255 Ga. 81</a></span>, 91 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../563/1/index.html">335 SE2d 567</a></span>) (1985).</div><div class="casepar">8. During the sentencing phase deliberations, the jury sent the court a note, to which the court responded as follows:</div><div class="casepar">had he been forced to remain.</div><div class="casepar">I received a request for information. The question reads: 'We'd like you to instruct us as to what we do if we cannot reach an unanimous decision.'</div><div class="casepar">At some point, obviously, if you cannot reach an unanimous decision, you can report that fact to me. But I don't mind telling you the Court doesn't think you have been deliberating long enough yet to be able to make that decision.

      The crimes were committed on October 13, 1986. Lonchar was arrested in Texas on October 20, 1986 and indicted on November 24. The case was tried June 22 through June 27, 1987, and Lonchar was sentenced on the latter date. A motion for new trial was filed July 24, 1987, and amended on October 12, 1987. The court reporter certified the transcript on July 29, 1987. After a hearing, the motion for new trial was denied on November 5, 1987. The case was docketed in this court January 26, 1988. After Lonchar was granted an extension of time to file his enumerations of error, oral arguments were postponed to the April term of court, and the case was orally argued April 13, 1988.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Ballistics examination showed that two guns were involved. Bullets from both guns were recovered from the bodies of two of the deceased victims, indicating that both defendants had shot them, while Margaret Sweat and Richard Smith were each shot by a different gun, but by one of the two guns used to kill the other two victims. Since Wells shot Richard Smith, it is reasonable to infer that Lonchar shot Margaret Sweat. Although Lonchar's attorney contends in his brief that a third, unidentified person was involved in the crime, there is no real evidence to support this contention.Richard Smith was in the bedroom when the killers first arrived. He never saw more than one of them at the same time. He first saw Lonchar's reflection in the bedroom mirror and Lonchar was not wearing a trench coat. He next saw Mitch Wells when the latter entered his bedroom and shot him. And then when the killers, or at least one of them, returned, Richard Smith caught a glimpse of one of them from behind, as he was leaving, and this one wore a trench coat. Since the evidence, including Lonchar's own admission, shows that he was the one who stabbed Margaret Sweat, and since he showed up at his cousin's home later that day wearing a trench coat, the most reasonable inference from the evidence is that the so-called "third" person Richard Smith saw was in fact Larry Lonchar.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      Lonchar was present at the sentencing phase while the state proved in aggravation that Lonchar had six previous felony convictions. Lonchar refused to remain while his father testified on his behalf. However, he was present for the sentencing-phase charge conference, the closing arguments, and the charge.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      His threatened disruptive behavior would likely have been more prejudicial to his case,</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
