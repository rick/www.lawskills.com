Even if the provision of the leases providing control of the James vehicles to Sanders, and the further provision obligating Sanders to pay the drivers was sufficient to afford a right to control those drivers and thus bring them within the category of employees under the Act, it must further appear that Sanders had ten or more employees in order to afford coverage. Code Ann.  114-107. These must be employees regularly in service and of the character entitled to compensation under the Act. It cannot include a partner, though the partner may do work for which he receives compensation in the nature of wages. U. S. Fidel. &amp;c. Co. v. Neal, <span class="casemissing">188 Ga. 105 (3 SE2d 80)</span>; s.c., <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 179 (3 SE2d 211)</span>; Chandler v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">47 Ga.

App. 860 (112 SE2d 409)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">There is no presumption that an employer has a sufficient number of employees to bring him under the provisions of the Act. Benefield v. McDonough Const. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/32/index.html">106 Ga. App. 194</a></span>, 198 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/32/index.html">126 SE2d 704</a></span>). Where, as here, the evidence fails to show that the employer had as many as ten employees (even counting James, Napier and Strange, but see Albert v. Hudson, <span class="casemissing">49 Ga. App. 636</span>, supra, and other cases cited in Division 1) a finding that that parties came within the coverage of the Act was unauthorized. Watson v. Tifton Trading Co., <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 377 (28 SE2d 188)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">W. H. James owned two trucks which he leased to Sanders Truck Transportation Company to be used in the hauling of freight (brick for the most part) under a permit which Sanders held from Interstate Commerce Commission. The lease agreement provided that Sanders was to have exclusive possession and control of the equipment, and would pay the driver, who was to be one qualified to operate the vehicle under provisions of ICC regulations, and would maintain it in good condition and furnish all gasoline, oil, tires and repairs necessary for its operation. Sanders provided the authority of its ICC permit, insurance, made the necessary reports to ICC of the trips and freight hauled, collected the charges from the shipper and paid over to James for the use of his truck 87 percent of the gross revenue which it produced. The driver was not in fact paid by Sanders, but by James, and was never on Sanders' payroll.</div><div class="casepar">James employed Napier as a driver who, in turn, provided to Sanders a medical report from his own doctor relative to his health and physical condition to comply with ICC requirements. Napier was paid by James $20 per trip for each load hauled, and Napier in turn employed Strange at $5 per trip to help him in loading and unloading. Both were injured when the truck was wrecked in a collision while on a trip to deliver a load of brick.</div><div class="casepar">The freight hauled was brick, and these were picked up at the plants of Merry Brothers or the Georgia-Carolina Company. Napier would usually drive to one of these plants, load up from its yard, obtain a bill of lading or manifest indicating the destination of the load, deliver it and on return deliver the consignee's receipt and a copy of the bill of lading, though sometimes he went first to the office of Sanders to ascertain whether there was a load to be hauled and, if so, for whom, and Napier was instructed by Mrs. Phillips, in Sanders' office, to go to Merry Brothers or to Georgia-Carolina where there would be a load for hauling. She gave no instruction as to where it was to go--that would be alone by the shipper. Napier was free to choose the time when he would make the trip, the route he would go, when and where he would stop, but under ICC regulations be was required to and did keep and turn in a daily log on each trip made. If he made a trip he would be paid by Mr. James; if he did not, he earned and was paid nothing. Sanders accounted to James for his share of the gross receipts under the terms of the lease, out of which he paid the expense of making the trips, including Napier's pay.</div><div class="casepar">On the matter of how many employees Sanders had, Mr. O'Neal Sanders testified that Sanders Truck Transportation Company, Inc. was a family corporation of which his father was president until his death in December 1964, and that his father had been in general charge of the management of the business up until his death. At the time of the accident in which claimants were injured in August 1964, the company had five employees. Of these, four were truck drivers, and there was Mrs. Phillips who worked in the office. quarterly returns of wage payments were made both to the State and Federal governments on these employees. Mr. Phillips, who was an employee of Merry Brothers, did some work for the Sanders Company, including some truck driving, but prior to January 1, 1965, he was never an employee or on the payroll. He had been a partner in the business with the corporation, taking a percentage of the net profit, and that was reflected by the company income tax returns. Although the company owned five trucks or tractors, and had some eight "flats" or beds to be pulled by the tractors, on which cotton and the like were hauled, they never had more than the four drivers as employees. There were four or five trucks under lease, including two from Mr. James, but except for the James truck operated by Napier they were all operated by the owner and none of the owners were employed by or on the Sanders payroll. (Leases on trucks other than the James vehicles were not called for, or placed in evidence and the provisions of those leases are not known).</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Napier testified that he had only seen three or four drivers and Mrs. Phillips. He knew of no other employees that Sanders had. He was not an employee, but worked for himself.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal is from a judgment of the superior court affirming an award of compensation by the full board.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Albert G.
