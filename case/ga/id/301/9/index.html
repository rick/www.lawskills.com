During the course of the litigation, SCI moved to enjoin Patterson from making further advancements to the directors of litigation expenses. SCI appeals from the trial court's ruling denying its motion on the basis that the directors had met the requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> (a) of the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the "GBCC").

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span>, in providing for the permissive advancement of reasonable expenses by a corporation, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> requires only the director's good faith affirmation and an undertaking to repay. No determination and authorization pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/855/index.html">14-2-855</a></span>, such as that required for indemnification, see id. at (a); OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/851/index.html">14-2-851</a></span>, is contained in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span>. As the Comment itself explains, the omission of the "determination" requirement was deliberate in</div><div class="casepar">(A) Whether or not the transaction is brought before the board of directors of the corporation for action, to the knowledge of the director at the time of commitment he or a related person is a party to the transaction or has a beneficial financial interest in or so closely linked to the transaction and of such financial significance to the director or a related person that it would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the director's judgment if he were called upon to vote on the transaction; or</div><div class="casepar">(B) The transaction is brought . . . before the board . . . for action, and to the knowledge of the director at the time of commitment any of the following persons is either a party to the transaction or has a beneficial financial interest so closely linked to the transaction and of such financial significance to that person that it would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the director's judgment if he were called upon to vote on the transaction: (i) an entity (other than the corporation) of which the director is a director, general partner, agent, or employee; (ii) a person that controls . . . or an entity that is controlled by, or is under common control with, one or more of the entities specified in division (i) . . .; or (iii) an individual who is a general partner, principal, or employer of the director.</div><div class="casepar">view of the fact that "all of the board are frequently named defendants," and hence the requirement of "a determination would involve a conflict of interests, and implementation of the costly procedures of [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/855/index.html">14-2-855</a></span> to obtain an authorization." Although the Comment then assumes that questions of expense advancement where all board members are named defendants would be left to the general conflict of interest provisions, we do not agree with the Comment's conclusion. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Given that the "determination" requirement was omitted in order to expedite the advancement of expenses and minimize the cost involved in approving such payments, the Comment's suggestion that  853 comes by default within the ambit of  861 (with its costly and burdensome conflict of interest requirements) contradicts the very cost-effective purpose of  853. Thus, we find the GBCC includes advancement of expenses pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> among those "few corporate transactions in which directors inherently have a special personal interest" that are "of a unique character and are addressed not by Part 6 but by special provisions of the Code." (Emphasis supplied.) Comment to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/861/index.html">14-2-861</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Georgia is but one of a majority of states <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> not requiring determination by the board or other decision-making authority for expense advancement. This being the case, it is interesting to note that extensive review of foreign jurisdictions by this Court and the parties to this appeal has failed to reveal any reported appellate decision applying corporate conflict of interest provisions to expense advancement under any similar factual scenario. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> The Louisiana legislature, however, has clarified this issue in that state by expressly authorizing the participation of interested directors in the corporation's decision to advance expenses. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span></div><div class="casepar">We therefore hold that compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> is sufficient to warrant advancement of expenses without the necessity of satisfying any other statutory preconditions. This holding is consistent with the expense advancement provision in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/856/index.html">14-2-856</a></span>, which enables a corporation, from its inception by the inclusion of a provision in its articles of incorporation, to pre-approve the advancement of expenses upon a director's compliance with the requirements in  856 (c). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. As in Swenson v. Thibaut, <span class="casemissing">250 SE2d 279</span>, 303 (VI) (N.C. App. 1978), we note that our holding should not be construed as saying "that under all circumstances the trial judge would be powerless to enjoin an advancement of legal fees by a corporation to its directors." (Emphasis supplied.) However, on the facts in the record, on which the trial court based its finding that the directors met the requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> (thus encompassing SCI's challenge to both the reasonableness of the expenses and the directors' good faith belief that they had acted in a manner which was in or not opposed to the best interests of Patterson), SCI has not shown the manifest abuse of discretion required before this court will overturn a denial of interlocutory injunctive relief. See generally OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/5/8/index.html">9-5-8</a></span>; Wilson v. Sermons, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/87/index.html">236 Ga. 400 (223 SE2d 816) (1976)</a></span>. Therefore, the denial of SCI's motion to enjoin the directors' literal compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> was correct.</div><div class="casepar">to us that the advancement of legal fees . . . is necessarily a transaction in which a director is adversely interested," that court did not have to examine the matter more fully because there were sufficient disinterested directors to approve the advancement. Accordingly, we agree with SCI that Swenson is distinguishable.</div><div class="casepar">Parker, Hudson, Rainer &amp; Dobbs, J. Marbury Rainer, M.

      Comment to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> provides in pertinent part:Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> establishes a workable standard for advancement of expenses to directors facing protracted and costly litigation as a result of their service to the corporation: indemnification is permitted when the director assures the corporation of his belief that he has met applicable standards of conduct and promises to repay funds advanced if he ultimately is not entitled to indemnification. This conforms closely to former [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/156/index.html">14-2-156</a></span> (e), and rejects the Model Act requirement of a determination by the board or other decision-making authority that the director is entitled to advances of expenses because the facts then known would not preclude ultimate indemnification. Because all of the board are frequently named defendants, such a determination would involve a conflict of interests, and implementation of the costly procedures of [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/855/index.html">14-2-855</a></span> to obtain an authorization. Elimination of these procedural requirements is intended to leave these questions to the general conflict of interest rules of Part 6. Thus authorization of advances may be subject to attack on the ground of unfairness to the corporation unless the director's affirmation meets the standards of required disclosure of [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/860/index.html">14-2-860</a></span> (4), and the advance is approved by disinterested directors in compliance with [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/862/index.html">14-2-862</a></span>, or by qualified shareholders in compliance with [OCGA ] <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/863/index.html">14-2-863</a></span>.

      "Director's conflicting interest transaction" is defined in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/860/index.html">14-2-860</a></span> (2) as a transaction "effected or proposed to be effected by the corporation . . . respecting which a director of the corporation has a conflicting interest.""Conflicting interest" is defined in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/860/index.html">14-2-860</a></span> (1) as meaning the interest a director in the corporation has respecting a transaction effected or proposed by the corporation if:</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/861/index.html">14-2-861</a></span> (b) provides that a director's conflicting interest transaction may not be enjoined, set aside, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions, in an action by a shareholder or by or in the right of the corporation, on the ground of an interest in the transaction of the director or any person with whom or which he has a personal, economic, or other association, if (1) the directors' action respecting the transaction was at any time taken in compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/862/index.html">14-2-862</a></span>; (2) shareholders' action respecting the transaction was at any time taken in compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/863/index.html">14-2-863</a></span>; or (3)" [t]he transaction, judged in the circumstances at the time of commitment, is established to have been fair to the corporation."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      Contrary to SCI's argument, we find the language in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> that a corporation "may" pay or reimburse directors' personal litigation expenses indicates only the legislative intent that such advance payments be permissive rather than mandatory.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;

      The Comment to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/861/index.html">14-2-861</a></span> specifies only OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/851/index.html">14-2-851</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/852/index.html">14-2-852</a></span> (indemnification arrangements); OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/858/index.html">14-2-858</a></span> (directors-and-officers liability insurance); and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/744/index.html">14-2-744</a></span> (termination of derivative proceedings by board action), as the statutes that are "not covered by, addressed under, or affected by Part 6."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      E.g., Cal. Corp. Code  317 (f); Del. Code Ann. tit. 8,  145 (e); Fla. Stat.  607.0850 (6); N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law,  723 (c) (McKinney).A number of states have statutes comparable to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/853/index.html">14-2-853</a></span> in the omission of a determination and the requirement of both an undertaking and an affirmation. E.g., Md. Corps. &amp; Assns. Code Ann.  2-418 (f); Or. Rev. Stat.  60.397; Tex. Bus. Corp. Act Ann. art. 2.02-1 K; Wash. Rev. Code  23B.08.530; Wisc. Stat.  180.0853. We note that Wisconsin also authorizes the corporation to require the director to pay "reasonable interest on the allowance [of expenses] to the extent that it is ultimately determined [that the director is not entitled to indemnification]." Id. at (2).For states requiring a determination by the board or other authority, see, e.g., Ala. Code  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/10/2A/21/index.html">10-2A-21</a></span> (e); Mich. Stat. Ann.  21.200 (564b); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.  293-A:8.53 (eff. Jan. 1, 1993); Tenn.

      La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  12:83 (D) provides that expenses incurred in defending any legal actionmay be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition thereof if authorized by the board of directors, without regard to whether participating members thereof are parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director . . . to repay such amount unless [ultimately found not entitled to indemnification].

      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/856/index.html">14-2-856</a></span> (a) provides for director indemnification "[i]f authorized by the articles of incorporation or a bylaw, contract, or resolution approved or ratified by the shareholders by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast" (emphasis supplied) except under certain circumstances detailed in subsection (b) (e.g., where the director has engaged in intentional misconduct, received an improper personal benefit, improperly appropriated a business opportunity of the corporation, etc.). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/856/index.html">14-2-856</a></span> (c) provides that "[w]here approved or authorized in the manner described in subsection (a)," a corporation may advance expenses if the director furnishes as in  853 -- a written affirmation of his good faith belief and a written undertaking to repay, the difference in  856 being that the behavior addressed in the written affirmation is that delineated in  856 (b), rather than the reference in  853 to  851 (a).</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Harkleroad &amp; Hermance, Donald R.
