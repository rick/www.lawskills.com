DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Hunter.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Grant J. Nicholl, plaintiff-appellant, lost or had stolen his wallet with his driver's license, credit cards, and other identification in a nightclub in DeKalb County in August or September 1993.</div><div class="casepar">On October 28, 1993, an unknown perpetrator was allowed by NationsBank of Georgia, N. A., to open a checking account in the name of Grant J. Nicholl with plaintiff's stolen identification and with only a $25 deposit. Such perpetrator passed a number of checks on such account which were returned to the payees due to "NSF" or "Account In Process of Closing." Plaintiff was unaware that his credit identity had been stolen and that someone was using a fraudulent checking account with his identity to pass bad checks.</div><div class="casepar">The checks included: four checks to Ingle Foods; one check to B. Dalton Books; one check to Pizza Hut; one check to Greyhound; five checks to Kroger Company; one check to A &amp; P; and multiple checks to Cub Foods. All these checks were returned to the payees for "NSF" and "Account In Process of Closing." On December 23, 1993, the perpetrator wrote a check made payable to A &amp; P for $136.42, forged with the signature of Grant J. Nicholl, and furnished a false address and telephone numbers; however, the date of birth and driver's license number were plaintiff's.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant, upon return of the check marked "NSF, Account In Process of Closing," sent a certified letter to the perpetrator at 4106 Glenwood Road, Apartment Number 3, Decatur, Georgia, addressed to the stolen credit identity of "Grant J. Nicholl." The notice was returned to the defendant marked "Return to Sender; Addressee Unknown." On March 23, 1994, after return of the letter, the defendant obtained a warrant for Grant J. Nicholl which was sworn out by Douglas Anderson, its employee-store manager and Co-defendant. Defendant made no investigation and took no steps to determine that Grant J. Nicholl was, in fact, the possessor of the NationsBank account and the drawer of the bad check. Other receivers of the bad checks, through reasonable investigation, determined that the plaintiff was not the drawer of checks in the name of Grant J. Nicholl drawn on the fraudulent NationsBank account.</div><div class="casepar">The lack of further investigation was contrary to A &amp; P's own practice of sending a second letter. A &amp; P employees, when the letter comes back, go over the incident with the cashier to determine if there was anything that could assist in the identifying of the suspect; however, in this case it cannot be remembered if this was done. A &amp; P's policy was to attempt to call the individual at home or work if the letter comes back. Although there were two telephone numbers on the check, the person responsible for contacting the check writer if the letter comes back did not know if he tried to call the numbers. The A &amp; P store manager did not fill out the response sheet to show what he had done in this case. In short, the manager did not follow store investigative policy and practices prior to taking out the warrant.</div><div class="casepar">On September 2, 1994, plaintiff was stopped for speeding. The arresting officer did a computer check for outstanding warrants and found a warrant for issuance of a bad check, which was drawn on the fraudulent checking account using plaintiff's stolen identity. Instead of releasing plaintiff for the traffic offense, the officer took plaintiff into custody on the bad check warrant.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff pled not guilty in court. On February 14, 1995, after giving samples of his handwriting which showed that the account signature and checks were forgeries, the trial court approved the entry of a nolle prosequi to the charge of issuing a bad check.</div><div class="casepar">1. The plaintiff's first enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants after finding that they acted with probable cause in swearing out a bad check warrant against the plaintiff. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">Over a period of time, the unlawful taking and use of the identity and credit history of another has reached such major proportions in Georgia that in 1998, the General Assembly created a separate criminal act to protect the public, the "Financial Identity Fraud Act." Ga. L. 1998,  2; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/9/120/index.html">16-9-120</a></span> et seq. Clearly, plaintiff was a victim of what now is called "financial identity fraud." From 1993 through 1995, an unknown perpetrator committed (1) theft of plaintiff's identification papers, including his driver's license and social security card; (2) fraud and forgery in opening a bogus checking account; and (3) forgery in signing plaintiff's name and using his identification papers to pass bad checks.

Those essential elements that are attacked most often on summary judgment are: "(1) a prosecution instituted maliciously and (2) without probable cause which (3) has terminated favorably to the plaintiff. [Cits.]" J. C. Penney Co. v. Miller, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/79/index.html">182 Ga.

However, in this case, probable cause is the essential element being attacked.</div><div class="casepar">Want of probable cause is an essential element of a malicious prosecution cause of action. Ordinarily, the existence of probable cause is a question of fact for jury determination. Only where the material facts are not in dispute, or when only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, does the existence of probable cause become an issue of law for the court to resolve. [Cits.] Kviten v. Nash, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../528/29/index.html">150 Ga. App. 589</a></span>, 591 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../528/29/index.html">258 SE2d 271</a></span>) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">"Want of probable cause is the gravamen of an action for malicious prosecution; and there can be no recovery by the plaintiff when there was any probable cause for the prosecution, even though it may appear that the prosecutor was actuated by improper motives.

Ellis v. Knowles, supra at 42. Since probable cause was based upon the reasonable belief of the prosecutor at the time the warrant was taken out by them, then, in deciding if the belief is reasonable, the prosecutors must have determined "that [the] apparent state of facts which seems to exist after reasonable and proper inquiry [by the exercise of] the duty of caution and avoidance of haste [constituted probable cause]." (Emphasis supplied.) Auld v. Colonial Stores, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. App. 329</span>, 335 (2) (<span class="casemissing">45 SE2d 827</span>) (1947); see also Coleman v.

App. 205</a></span>, 207 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../632/67/index.html">163 SE2d 256</a></span>) (1968). If a reasonable person would have investigated to determine if probable cause existed prior to swearing out a warrant, then such failure to make an investigation may imply malice, as well as go to whether probable cause existed. See Medoc Corp. v. Keel, supra at 617 (2); Melton v. LaCalamito, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../499/03/index.html">158 Ga.

Probable cause is defined to be the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted.</div><div class="casepar">(Citations and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original.) Tanner-Brice Co. v. Barrs, supra at 453 (2); see also Wilson v. Wheeler's, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../379/48/index.html">190 Ga.

"Whether the circumstances alleged to show probable cause existed is a matter of fact, to be determined by the jury, but whether they amount to probable cause is a question of law for the court." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Wilson v. Wheeler's, Inc., supra at 252 (1).</div><div class="casepar">Probable cause in this regard may be defined as the existence of such facts and circumstances in the mind of a reasonable person, the reaction of those facts and circumstances upon the mind of such reasonable person, and the reasonable acting on the facts within the mind of the prosecutor, so as to cause a belief the person was guilty of the crime for which the prosecution was being pursued.</div><div class="casepar">Booker v. Eddins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/13/index.html">183 Ga. App. 449</a></span>, 451 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/13/index.html">359 SE2d 211</a></span>) (1987), overruled on other grounds, Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Premier Tractor &amp; Trailer Repair, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../372/08/index.html">192 Ga. App. 243 (384 SE2d 449) (1989)</a></span>. Probable cause may not approach absolute certainty as to the facts, and it is not inconsistent with a considerable element of doubt; however, it must be more than mere conjecture or unfounded suspicion. The belief must be supported by appearances known to the defendant at the time, and a prosecution instituted without probable cause cannot be justified by anything, short of guilt in fact, which comes to the knowledge of the defendant later. The appearances must be such as to lead a reasonable man to set the criminal proceeding in motion. The defendant is not necessarily required to verify his information, where it appears to be reliable; but where a reasonable man would investigate further before beginning the prosecution, he may be liable for failure to do so. All such factors as the reliability of the source, the availability of further information and the difficulty of obtaining it, the reputation of the accused, and his opportunity to offer an explanation, and the apparent necessity of prompt action, are to be considered in determining whether it was reasonable to act without verification. Prosser, [Law of Torts,  119 at 842 (4th ed. 1971)].</div><div class="casepar">(Punctuation omitted.) Melton v. LaCalamito, supra at 824 (2) (b); see also Atlantic Zayre v. Meeks, supra at 269; Wilson v. Wheeler's, Inc., supra at 253.</div><div class="casepar">This is not a case where a pre-warrant investigation or other inquiry was conducted by the defendants or the police. Medoc Corp. v. Keel, supra at 617. This also is not a case where immediate action to catch the perpetrator demands action without time to investigate further. While there existed probable cause to reasonably believe that a perpetrator passed a bad check to the defendants, the identity of the perpetrator was unknown, although false identification was presented, giving a real "identity." "[T]he prosecutor is under a duty of caution and avoidance of haste. [Cits.]" Sanfrantello v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra at 207; see also McGonagil v. Treadwell, <span class="casemissing">216 Ga. App. 850 (456 SE2d 260) (1995)</span>; Jones v. Parrish, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/63/index.html">203 Ga. App. 566</a></span>, 568-569 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/63/index.html">417 SE2d 210</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">Where there exist many people with the same name, where financial identity fraud is common, and where criminals passing bad checks conceal their true identity through various means, a reasonable person would not assume that the identity on the check was the same as the perpetrator without further investigation to verify that the perpetrator and the identity are the same person, because it is equally reasonable to believe that a criminal who would pass a bad check would also use a false I. D. or another's identification as a means to conceal his true identity. See Kviten v. Nash, supra at 591 (5); Sirmans v. Peterson, supra at 709. Thus, the identity of the perpetrator was uncertain, requiring an investigation before a warrant was sworn out against an identity which may or may not be the perpetrator. See Melton v. LaCalamito, supra at 824. A &amp; P's own policy of sending a second letter if the first letter is returned indicates an awareness that there is a problem as to either identity or address. This need is further underscored by the need to attempt to call the person at home or work prior to taking out a warrant; the lack of a valid address and telephone numbers should indicate the need for further investigation.</div><div class="casepar">It is to avoid misidentification that the law enforcement community verifies the identity of a suspected perpetrator prior to making an arrest. Criminals often seek to conceal their identity to avoid prosecution. To avoid making mistakes as to identity, law enforcement agencies are mandated after arrest in felony cases, and some misdemeanor cases, to provide the name used, known aliases, photographic identification records in conjunction with a physical description, fingerprints, date of birth, social security number, biographical history, criminal history, and possibly DNA, if available, to the Georgia Crime Information Center ("GCIC") so that a positive identification can be made of suspects in the future by their GCIC identification number maintained by the GBI and cross-checked with the National Crime Information Center ("NCIC") maintained by the FBI prior to arrest. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/35/3/4/index.html">35-3-4</a></span> (a) (1), (8); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/35/3/36/index.html">35-3-36</a></span>. To take out a warrant without knowing if the person who is named in the warrant is the perpetrator risks a finding of lack of probable cause by arresting the wrong person. See Ellis v. Knowles, supra at 42 (2).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, the defendants took what is now known to be a forged signature with the real driver's license number and social security number and assumed, without even a preliminary investigation, that the perpetrator and the stolen identity were the same person. See Melton v. LaCalamito, supra at 824. The defendants did not even obtain a physical description from the cashier who accepted the bad check or NationsBank's customer service person who opened the checking account. Where, as in this case, there was no press of time or urgency, inquiry with the Department of Public Safety could have been made from the real license number and could have provided plaintiff's address, or the plaintiff could have been found listed in the telephone directory. The simplest thing that the defendant could do would have been to report the crime to the police and allow them to use their investigative resources. Further, the return of the notice as being a false address should have put the defendants on further inquiry that the identity was also false, i.e., not the true identity of the perpetrator, so that further inquiry was necessary. The bedrock of probable cause is that "it must be more than mere conjecture or unfounded suspicion [that the suspected identity is, in fact, the perpetrator]." Melton v. LaCalamito, supra at 824 (2) (b); see also McGonagil v. Treadwell, supra at 854; Jones v. Parrish, supra at 568 (1). Here, there was nothing but an unverified suspicion that the perpetrator and the identity "Grant J. Nicholl" were one and the same person. This raised an issue of probable cause, because two reasonable inferences could be drawn from the presence of the name, "Grant J. Nicholl", i.e., that this was the identity of the perpetrator or that it was not the identity of the perpetrator but either a false identity or a real identity used to conceal the perpetrator's identity. See Kviten v. Nash, supra at 591; Sirmans v. Peterson, supra at 709.</div><div class="casepar">These factors</div><div class="casepar">raised a jury question as to whether a reasonably prudent person would have made further inquiry [to determine the identity of the perpetrator] before prosecuting.

LaCalamito, supra at 824 (2) (b); see also Atlantic Zayre v. Meeks, supra at 269. Such factors in this case go to the existence of probable cause and to the lack of probable cause, so that the jury may infer malice. See Atlantic Zayre, Inc. v. Meeks, supra at 269; Kviten v. Nash, supra at 591 (5). Instead of charging a known suspected perpetrator, the defendants charged an "identity" Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. McGonagil v. Treadwell, supra at 854 (2); Jones v. Parrish, supra at 568-569 (1).</div><div class="casepar">2.

Thus, the General Assembly provided immunity only against suit brought by the person who made, drew, uttered, executed, or delivered the check, but did not exclude suit by an innocent party whose name was forged to a fraudulent account created in their identity. Such interpretation would constitute an impermissible judicial extension of the Act.</div><div class="casepar">This was not a legitimate account that the plaintiff had opened and closed, leaving unused checks that a third party could use, but was a fraudulently created account which criminally used the plaintiff's identity. Further, this was not a case where plaintiff had actually received notice of the bad checks being passed on his account after it was closed. In this case, the facts and circumstances did not clearly come within the express language of the immunity dealing with closed accounts. Therefore, Grand Union Co. v.

By 1998, the General Assembly was faced with many innocent victims who had their financial identities fraudulently used by criminals. The General Assembly intentionally did not extend immunity to encompass such victims of Financial Identity Fraud because, in order to establish probable cause, reasonable inquiry to verify the perpetrator's identity and to avoid further victimizing the innocent victim should be made by anyone seeking to prosecute.
