Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Pharr. December 29, 1959.</div><div class="casepresiding">TOWNSEND, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The issue in this workmen's compensation case is whether an employer-employee relationship or a master-servant relationship existed between the parties. Where one is employed generally to perform certain services for another, and there is no specific contract to do a certain piece of work according to specifications for a stipulated sum, it is inferable that the employer has retained the right to control the manner, method, and means of the performance of the contract, and that the employee is not an independent contractor. Accordingly, testimony of the claimant that he worked on an hourly rather than a contract basis, combined with testimony of the defendant that he could have stopped the work and paid off the claimant at any time, authorized the finding that the contract was a contract of employment, and not a contract with an independent contractor to achieve a specified result.</div><div class="casepar">James L. Cash, while engaged in welding together 18 barrels or drums to be used as floats to support pipes used in the business of the defendant James W. Threatt, was injured when one of the barrels exploded. He filed a claim with the State Board of Workmen's Compensation which was contested by Threatt and his insurance carrier on the ground that the claimant was not an employee but an independent contractor. Briefly, the evidence on the hearing of the case showed that the claimant owned his own welding equipment and had a garage and welding shop which he had operated for several years; that on occasion he took his welding equipment to the premises of others mounted on a jeep; that he had previously welded barrel floats for Threatt and for other persons and knew what was needed in this operation; that Threatt called Cash and asked him to come over and do some welding for him; that Cash was to receive $4.00 per hour for his labor; that Cash appeared in answer to the call and Threatt then showed him 18 barrels and told him to weld them "similar as before;" that he was also told about some welding on a tractor-trailer, and was further told that when he finished that he would be shown some welding work to be done on a barge. As to the contract, the claimant testified: Q. You work more or less on a contract basis? A. No, sir, not too much, I work more or less on an hourly basis." The defendant testified: "Q. Could you have stopped him on those barrels at any time you wanted to and paid him off at that time? A. Yes."</div><div class="casepar">The hearing director entered an award in favor of the claimant, which was affirmed by the full board on appeal. The Judge of the Superior Court of Fulton County reversed the award and directed that judgment be entered up in favor of the defendant, and this order is assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar">The burden of proving the employer-employee relationship is on the claimant in a workmen's compensation case. Young v. Demos, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 577</span>, 579 (28 S. E. 2d 891). However, in view of the liberal interpretation accorded compensation laws generally, it has been held that "in determining whether a claimant in a workmen's compensation case is an employee and subject to the act, or an independent contractor and not so subject, any doubt is to be resolved in favor of his status as an employee rather than an independent contractor." Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Henry, <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 868</span>, 870 (194 S. E. 430). This means simply that, while the claimant is at all times cast with the burden of proof, the evidence offered will, so far as it is genuinely susceptible of construction, be given that construction which is in his favor in determining whether he has carried that burden by a preponderance of the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">"Where one is employed generally to perform certain services for another, and there is no specific contract to do a certain piece of work according to specifications for a stipulated sum, it is inferable that the employer has retained the right to control the manner, method and means of the performance of the contract, and that the employee is not an independent contractor." Mitchem v. Shearman Concrete Pipe Co., <span class="casemissing">45 Ga. App. 809 (1)</span> (165 S. E. 889); Continental Cas. Co. v. Payne, <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 873 (1)</span> (194 S. E. 428). As pointed out in Bentley v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 587</span>, 590 (173 S. E. 737) the controlling issue determining whether the master-servant relationship exists in Georgia is whether the employer has the right to assume control of the manner, means and time of the work, although this criterion is "subject to criticism as not being all-comprehensive." Where the question is not discussed at the time the services are engaged, and where it never arises during the performance, it is indeed difficult to determine whether the employer had, or intended to reserve, such right. "It is of no consequence that the witness did not exercise this right to control the time and manner of the contract performance. Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Pruitt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../693/62/index.html">95 Ga. App. 235</a></span> (97 S. E. 2d 521); Davis v. Starrett Bros., Inc., <span class="casemissing">39 Ga. App. 422</span> 427 (147 S. E. 530); Home Accident Ins. Co. v. Daniel, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. App. 648</span> (157 S. E. 245); St. Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. v. Alexander, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../719/01/index.html">84 Ga. App. 207</a></span>, 210 (65 S. E. 2d 694). While the deceased did not work regular hours, under authority of Lokey &amp; Simpson v. Hightower, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 577</span> [196 S. E. 210], this is not necessary for him to be classified as an employee." American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Tanner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../688/68/index.html">97 Ga. App. 122</a></span> (101 S. E. 2d 875). In the Tanner case an award in favor of the claimant was affirmed although the claimant, as foreman of a company which manufactured cabinets on order for the builder, merely had an arrangement with the builder under which he installed the completed cabinets at $15 per house in houses as specified by the builder, and in general his information was obtained from the order blanks sent to the manufacturing company. In that case, as in this one, a man was employed for certain work the extent and duration of which was not known at the time, which was a kind of work that required little or no instruction or control because of the knowledge already in the possession of the person employed, and as to which no definite working hours were fixed. In both cases the right of control was not actually exercised by the employer, but in both cases the employer indicated an understanding that the right had been retained. In this case the employer's testimony must be so construed because, although he told the claimant to weld 18 barrels and gave him no further instructions on that part of the work, he informed him that he would have further instructions as to other work when that was completed. If it be argued, however, that a contract existed between the two at least for the welding of 18 barrels, with the possibility of another contract upon its completion, the argument is effectively destroyed by the employer's own testimony that he could have stopped the claimant from working on the barrels at any time he wanted to and paid him off at that time. The testimony of a party litigant must, where equivocal or contradictory, be construed most strongly against him, and this witness was a party defendant. A contract to build or repair some specific thing, as distinguished from a contract of employment where the employee works at building or repairing that thing, demands a subject matter capable of ascertainment, sufficiently specific so</div><div class="casepar">that on a breach by either an action will lie in favor of the other. The claimant testified that he was working by the hour and not under contract; the employer agreed that he might stop him from working on the barrels and pay him off at any time he wanted to do so. Thus, the contract as understood by both parties must have been a contract of employment for it obviously did not include as a part of its subject matter the completed performance of any particular work. This testimony is sufficient to authorize an inference on the part of the fact-finding tribunal that the contract was one of employment, and the judge of the superior court accordingly erred in setting aside the award.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
