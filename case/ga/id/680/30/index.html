Macon City Court. Before Judge Baldwin. October 20, 1959.</div><div class="casepresiding">NICHOLS, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The judgments of the trial court overruling the defendant's motion for new trial and motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto were not error for any reason assigned.</div><div class="casepar">Ethel Chambliss sued John Carter to recover the full value of the life of her deceased husband who died from injuries received in a collision between a truck being driven by the plaintiff's husband and one being driven by the defendant. On the trial of the case, at the conclusion of the evidence presented by both parties, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict which was denied, and thereafter the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Thereafter the defendant's motions for a new trial and for a judgment non obstante veredicto based on his motion for a directed verdict were denied and he now excepts to these judgments adverse to him.</div><div class="casepar">(A) "Now should you find the dead man entered the Fifth Street intersection at a speed greater than 5 miles per hour, you would determine for yourselves whether or not this was the proximate cause or a contributing cause entering into the proximate cause of the collision, and should you find driving in excess of 5 miles per hour at said time and place, if he did, was not the proximate cause and was not a contributing cause entering into the proximate cause of the collision, such act would not inure to the benefit of the defendant in this case." (B) "I charge you that should you find that the electric signal light at the intersection of Fifth Street and Walnut was showing green for those vehicles headed north on Walnut Street that it was the duty of Joe Chambliss [the plaintiff's husband] to comply with said ordinances and slow down to a speed of not more than 5 miles per hour, and to have his truck under instant control. I charge you that if you should find that Joe Chambliss failed to slow down to 5 miles per hour or failed to have his truck under instant control, and that if these failures were the sole proximate cause of his death, then and in that event the plaintiff cannot recover."</div><div class="casepar">Both of these excerpts from the charge had reference to the following ordinance of the City of Macon, where the collision occurred, and which was admittedly applicable to the plaintiff's husband: "Drivers of vehicles before driving into or crossing a boulevard from another street shall slow down to a speed not more than 5 miles per hour, and shall have car under instant control, but shall be required to come to a full stop only at those points on boulevards indicated by signals or markers."</div><div class="casepar">1. Special ground numbered 4 of the amended motion for new trial complains that the excerpt from the charge quoted as "A" was in irreconcilable conflict with the excerpt quoted "B," and special ground 6 complains that the excerpt quoted as "A" was error because it failed to include the requirement of the quoted ordinance that the plaintiff's deceased husband have his vehicle under "instant control."</div><div class="casepar">It is obvious that the excerpts were intended to be mere converse statements of the same rule, and while the excerpt quoted as "A" does not refer to the "instant control" requirement of the ordinance, since the court was there charging the jury when the violation of such ordinance would not estop the plaintiff from recovering, the omission, if error, was harmless to the defendant since it was favorable to him, and while such excerpt is not as complete as the charge in the excerpt quoted as "B" the charge complained of is not in conflict with that quoted as "B" as contended by the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 5 complains that the excerpt quoted as "B" in the statement of facts in effect nullifies the quoted city ordinance because the charge in effect instructed the jury that drivers of vehicles headed north on Walnut Street had to obey the ordinance to slow down to 5 miles per hour and have their vehicles under instant control only when the electric traffic signal was showing green toward them.</div><div class="casepar">It is impossible for the court to see any merit in the defendant's contention in this ground of the amended motion for new trial, for certainly the defendant does not seriously contend that if the electric traffic signal facing one going north on the street in question was red such person could slow down to 5 miles per hour, have his vehicle under "instant control," and then proceed across the boulevard with impunity, and this is the only assignment of error on the charge as to why it allegedly nullified the ordinance.</div><div class="casepar">The charge complained of here is palpably free of the error complained of for the only interpretation that could be placed on such instruction by the jury is: While Joe Chambliss was required to stop if the electric traffic signal was showing red toward him, even if it was green he was required to slow down to 5 miles per hour, etc. Accordingly, this ground of the motion for new trial is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. " 'As was said by the Supreme Court in Adler v. Adler, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/17/index.html">207 Ga. 394</a></span>, 405 (61 S. E. 2d 824), "This court does not pass upon the credibility of witnesses, nor the weight to be given evidence on disputed facts. These are questions for the jury whether their verdict is contrary to the evidence, or contrary to its weight, or decidedly and strongly against its weight, is a question the law vests in the trial judge's discretion. He may grant a new trial on these grounds, but this court has no such power. Where the trial judge approves the verdict, the sole question for determination by this court is whether there is any evidence sufficient to authorize it." See also Knox v. Knox, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../177/90/index.html">213 Ga. 677</a></span>, 679 (101 S. E. 2d 89).' Canal Ins. Co. v. Winge Bros., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../690/36/index.html">97 Ga. App. 782</a></span>, 787 (104 S. E. 2d 525)." Halpern v. Strickland, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../688/40/index.html">98 Ga. App. 890</a></span>, 891 (107 S. E. 2d 227).</div><div class="casepar">The evidence adduced on the trial in the case sub judice was conflicting, and while the members of this court, if sitting on the jury, may not have returned the verdict found, it cannot be said that the verdict for the plaintiff was not authorized where there was evidence that the plaintiff's husband was crossing an intersection with a green traffic signal and the vehicle being driven by him was struck by the vehicle being driven by the defendant while crossing the intersection against a red traffic signal. Whether the witnesses who testified to these facts were successfully impeached was a question for the jury's determination, and where, as here, their determination of such facts has been approved by the trial judge, such findings cannot be overturned by either the general grounds of the motion for new trial or of the motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto.</div><div class="casepar">Judgments affirmed.
