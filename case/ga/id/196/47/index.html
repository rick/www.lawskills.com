Under the "Revenue Tax Act to Legalize and Control Alcoholic Beverages and Liquors" (Code, Ann. Supp.,  58-1001 et seq.), one cannot lawfully engage in the sale of alcoholic beverages and liquors by proxy, and without obtaining a license or permit as required by the statute. One who, as a silent or dormant member of a partnership, engages in the sale of alcoholic beverages and liquors under a license or permit issued to an individual other than the silent or dormant member, and not to the partnership, is guilty of a violation of the law.</div><div class="casepar">2. A contract to do an illegal thing is void, and a court of equity will not lend its aid to one of the parties thereto, seeking the enforcement thereof, when it affirmatively appears from the allegations of the petition that the contract involves a violation of a criminal statute. </div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Nicholas Preston Smith, as executrix of the estate of Nicholas Preston Smith, deceased, brought her petition for receivership and accounting in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, against Keith A. Nix, in which she alleged: that her testator and the defendant Nix were engaged as a partnership, under an oral partnership agreement, in the business of selling intoxicating liquors at Sunset Liquor Store, at 96 Alabama Street, S. W., in Atlanta, Georgia; that it was agreed between the alleged partners that Smith would, and that he did, advance the total sum of $24,903.45 in the purchase of the said liquor business, the stock of goods, and for other expenses incurred in the establishment thereof, and that the license to engage in such business would be applied for in the name of, and the business would be operated by, the defendant Nix, Smith being a silent or dormant partner in the business; that for a portion of the time, Smith and Nix agreed to and did operate the said business under the name of an employee, Frank Kelley, and under a license obtained in the name of such employee; that, at all times mentioned, the business was conducted under licenses obtained in the individual name of Nix or Kelley, and it is not alleged that a license was ever obtained at any time either in the name of the partnership or of Smith. It was alleged that the partnership terminated by operation of law on June 2, 1948, by the death of Smith, and that the plaintiff had demanded of the defendant Nix an accounting and payment of the sums advanced by Smith, and such profits as had been earned by the business, which the defendant refused, and she prayed for: (a) process; (b) the appointment of a receiver to take charge of, wind up, and sell the said partnership business, and hold the proceeds therefrom until further order of the court; (c) a full and complete accounting of all the assets and liabilities of the business, and for general relief; and (d) a judgment against the defendant for the amount of money placed by Smith in the business, together with one-half of all profits made by the store from the time of its inception.</div><div class="casepar">To this petition the defendant demurred upon the grounds: (1) said petition does not set forth any equitable cause of action against the defendant; (2) the allegations contained in the petition are insufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the equitable relief prayed; and (3) by an amendment to the demurrer, that the petition alleges a state of facts which shows that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief, because (a) the allegations concerning the agreement, arrangements, and transactions entered into between Smith and Nix with respect to engaging in the liquor business, if made and carried out as alleged, were illegal and void and constituted a fraud upon the Georgia laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages; and (b) the said agreement, arrangements and transactions, if made and carried out as alleged, were contrary to and in violation of public policy and good morals. To the judgment of the trial court, sustaining this demurrer and dismissing the petition, the plaintiff excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1068 provides that the manufacture, sale, and distribution of spirituous liquors is not a right in this State, but merely a privilege granted to those to whom a license is issued, and this court has held that a license to sell spirituous liquors is neither a contract nor a property right in the licensee, but a mere permit to do what would otherwise be an offense against the general law. Ison v. Mayor &amp; Council of Griffin, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 623</span> (25 S. E. 611), Owens v. Rutherford, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 143</span>, 149 (36 S. E. 2d, 309).</div><div class="casepar">In order for one to have the privilege of engaging in the sale of alcoholic beverages, a majority of the voters of the county in which he proposes so to engage must have authorized the sale thereof in that county at an election called and held as prescribed by law. Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1002 et seq.</div><div class="casepar">By the terms of the statute (Code, Ann. Supp.,  58-1011), a "retailer" or "retail distributor" is defined as "any person, firm, or corporation engaged in selling, at retail, any distilled spirits or alcohol, for beverage purposes."</div><div class="casepar">By Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1022, the State Revenue Commissioner is authorized "To issue licenses provided for in this Chapter, and to decline to issue any license to any person or corporation who in his reasonable discretion are not proper persons to have such permits."</div><div class="casepar">Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1031 provides that no State license shall be granted until a municipal or county license, as the case may be, is first presented, and that the proper municipal or county authorities shall have full authority to pass "on the character, reliability, and other qualities of fitness before issuing such license."</div><div class="casepar">Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1032 prescribes the minimum license fees for the manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, and  58-1039 provides that no license granted under this Chapter shall be transferable without the consent of the Revenue Commissioner.</div><div class="casepar">Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1065 makes it unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to sell spirituous liquors or beverages without first obtaining a license so to do. See also  58-1069.</div><div class="casepar">It will thus be seen that the business of selling alcoholic or spirituous liquors or beverages is strictly regulated, and under the provisions of this statute every "person," "firm," or "corporation" engaging in any of the businesses there authorized is required to obtain a license so to do, and great latitude is granted the authorities in passing upon and determining the "character, reliability, and other qualities of fitness" of the applicants for licenses.</div><div class="casepar">By Code (Ann. Supp.)  58-1074 it is provided that no retail license shall be issued to any applicant or person, unless it is shown by a certificate from the ordinary of the county of the applicant's residence that the applicant has been a bona fide resident of the county for at least twelve months immediately preceding the application; and that no license shall be issued to any person who has not been a resident of the State for at least twelve months immediately preceding the issuance thereof, or of a county in which liquor may be legally sold; and by  58-1071 it is provided that "There shall be no exception from the permit fees, license fees, and/or tax as provided by this Chapter in favor of any person whatsoever." Under the foregoing provisions of the law, a person, firm, or corporation in Georgia cannot lawfully engage in the liquor business by proxy, or under the name of another, but any and all persons, firms, or corporations who desire to engage therein must first obtain a license so to do in their own name. It would, to a large extent, destroy the effectiveness of the regulations prescribed by this law if one were permitted to engage in such business in the name of and under a license granted to another, and would open the door for every gangster and racketeer who could not himself obtain a license or permit to engage in such business if he could secure a license in the name of some other individual. Such is not the purpose or intent of the law, but its purpose and intent is to the contrary. There can be no such thing, under the terms of this law, as a silent or dormant partner in the liquor business. If a partnership desires to engage therein, the partnership must apply for and obtain a license as such; and if a person actually engages in the liquor business as a silent or dormant member of a partnership in the name of and under a license issued to an individual, he is guilty of a violation of the statute.</div><div class="casepar">A case very much in point is that of Garrison v. Burns, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 762</span> (26 S. E. 471). In that case Burns brought suit against Garrison to rescind a contract and recover certain personalty, consisting largely of barroom fixtures and appurtenances. It appeared that before the sale to Garrison, Burns had been engaged in the retail liquor business in the City of Macon, and for this purpose he had taken out a license in the name of "James Burns &amp; Co.," though there was in fact no partnership, and no person interested in the business as the "Co." Liquor licenses not being transferable, Burns had this particular one made out as above stated in order that it might be used by anyone to whom he should sell his business. This business was included in the sale to Garrison. Burns falsely told the city inspector that Garrison was a member of the firm of James Burns &amp; Co., so as to enable Garrison to go on with the business. He and Garrison had an agreement to that effect, both knowing that the license could not be lawfully assigned. In dealing with this situation, this court said: "It will thus be seen that the parties to the contract under review necessarily contemplated and intended that there should be by one of them a violation of the statute which makes it penal to sell spirituous liquors without a license . . . The license in the name of 'James Burns &amp; Co.,' under which he [Garrison] did business, was, as to him, the same thing in law as no license at all; and upon a disclosure of the truth, would have afforded him no protection from a criminal prosecution."</div><div class="casepar">2. From what has been said, it is apparent that the contract between Smith and Nix, as alleged in the petition, involves an illegal enterprise in violation of a criminal statute. Code  20-501 provides: "A contract to do an immoral or illegal thing is void. If the contract be severable, that which is legal will not be annulled by that which is illegal." In Tanner v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 211</span>, 215 (17 S. E. 2d, 581), it is held: "He who comes into equity must come with clean hands, 'is . . . a universal rule guiding and regulating the action of equity courts in their interposition on behalf of suitors for any and every purpose, and in their administration of any and every species of relief.' Under this maxim, 'whenever a party, who, as actor, seeks to set the judicial machinery in motion and obtain some remedy, has violated conscience, or good faith, or other equitable principle, in his prior conduct, then the doors of the court will be shut against him in limine; the court will refuse to interfere on his behalf, to acknowledge his right, or to award him any remedy.' 1 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, 737, 738  397; Coleman Burden &amp; Warthen Co. v. Dannenberg Co., <span class="casemissing">103 Ga. 784</span> (30 S. E. 639, 41 L.R.A. 470, 68 Am. St. R. 143); Whittington v. Summerall, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. 345</span>; Peacock v.

See also Garrison v. Burns, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 762</span> (supra); Garland v. Isbell, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 34</span> (76 S. E. 591); Abbott Furniture Co. v. Mobley, <span class="casemissing">141 Ga. 456</span> (81 S. E. 196). The trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the plaintiff's petition.</div><div class="casepar">What is here held is not in conflict with the decision of this court in Moore v. Harrison, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 814</span> (44 S. E. 2d, 551), for the question here presented was not there adjudicated.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
