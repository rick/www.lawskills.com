Before Judge Gower. Dooly Superior Court. October 1, 1949.</div><div class="casepresiding">HEAD, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The allegations of the petition were insufficient to show a clear legal right in the plaintiff to the relief of mandamus. </div><div class="casepar">Abner Hansard filed a petition for mandamus against J. Frank Powell, as Ordinary of Dooly County, it being alleged: The plaintiff's attorney applied to the defendant for a copy of the application for marriage license, the license, and the officiating minister's certificate, certifying to the marriage of L. J. Allen and Barbara Ann Hansard, the minor daughter of the plaintiff. The defendant violated the law, in that he failed to post the notice required of the application for marriage license; he failed to post any notice, and issued the license in less than five days. At the time of the marriage Barbara Ann Hansard was a minor, fifteen years of age, and the marriage license was issued without the consent of the parent or parents of such minor. As a result of the conduct of the defendant, he is liable in damages under the provisions of the Code,  53-208, and the plaintiff has filed suit against the defendant and his bondsman. The certified copies are required to be introduced in evidence in the trial of that case. "When said J. Frank Powell certified to these papers, he failed and refused to certify that he was the Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary." The defendant is the Ordinary of Dooly County and he is Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary of Dooly County. It is his legal duly as "Ordinary and Ex Officio Clerk" to execute certified copies, stating therein that he is "Ordinary and Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary." The plaintiff is entitled to the writ of mandamus against the Ordinary of Dooly County to compel him to certify to these papers, and to state in the certificate "that he is Ordinary and Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary of Dooly County." By amendment it was alleged that the plaintiff offered to pay for the copy of the application for marriage license, the marriage license, and the minister's certificate, and that the defendant refused to certify these copies as both ordinary and ex officio clerk. The plaintiff demanded, and was refused, certified copies of Use documents by the ordinary as both ordinary and ex officio clerk.</div><div class="casepar">A rule nisi was granted, and the defendant filed general and special demurrers and an answer. The bill of exceptions recites that the general and special demurrers of the defendant were overruled, and that the issues were passed upon on the pleadings alone without the introduction of evidence. The judge of the superior court issued an order requiring the defendant to certify to the documents requested as "both Ordinary and Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary, Dooly County, Georgia." The defendant excepted to the order overruling his demurrers and to the judgment making the mandamus absolute.</div><div class="casepar"> "There are two essential requisites of a valid application for mandamus to enforce a right, viz.: the legal duty imposed on the defendants to do the thing they are asked to do; and a pecuniary loss to the plaintiff for which he can not be compensated in damages." Atlantic Ice &amp; Coal Corp. v. Decatur, <span class="casemissing">154 Ga. 882</span> (115 S. E. 912). Ordinaries may be compelled to perform ministerial duties imposed upon them by law. Head v. Waldrup, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 165</span> (17 S. E. 2d, 585). "To entitle one to the writ of mandamus, it must appear that he has a clear legal right to have performed the particular act which he seeks to have enforced." City of Atlanta v. Blackman Health Resort, <span class="casemissing">153 Ga. 499</span>, 505 (113 S. E. 545).</div><div class="casepar">The Code,  24-1801, provides: "The ordinaries are, by virtue of their offices, clerks of their own courts; but they may, at their own expense, appoint one or more clerks, for whose conduct they are responsible, who hold their offices at the pleasure of such ordinary." By  24-1804 (11) it is provided: "It is the duty of such clerks, or the ordinaries acting as such . . . To give transcripts likewise as they are required; and when the ordinary and the clerk are the same person, so to state in the certificates."</div><div class="casepar">The petition in this case alleges that, when the ordinary certified to the copies of papers on file in his office, "be failed and refused to certify that he was the Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary," and it is contended that the plaintiff was entitled to have the copies so certified. He prayed that the ordinary "be required to certify to them as Ordinary and Ex Officio Clerk of the Court of Ordinary of Dooly County," and the judgment making the mandamus absolute required that the copies be certified as prayed.</div><div class="casepar">In Lay v. Sheppard, <span class="casemissing">112 Ga. 111</span> (37 S. E. 132), it was said that a certificate by the ordinary "does not conform to law unless it affirmatively discloses whether or not such ordinary was also the clerk of that court." Since the Code,  24-1801, provides that ordinaries are, "by virtue of their offices, clerks of their own courts," a certificate by the ordinary in which he states that by virtue of his office he is clerk of his own court would comply with the requirements of  24-1804 (11).</div><div class="casepar">In Sellers v. Page, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 634 (3)</span> (56 S. E. 1011), it was said that an ordinary's certificate sufficiently authenticates the record when it appears affirmatively in the certificate "that the ordinary had no clerk and was acting himself as the clerk of his own court." In Smallwood v. Kimball, <span class="casemissing">129 Ga. 50 (2)</span> (58 S. E. 640), it was said that a certificate by an ordinary "does not render the copy admissible in evidence, unless it is made affirmatively to appear that there is no clerk other than the ordinary." A certificate by the ordinary that he has "no clerk" would be a substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule stated in the Smallwood case.</div><div class="casepar">Conceding, but not deciding, that the other essential requisite, "pecuniary loss to the plaintiff for which he can not be compensated in damages," was made sufficiently to appear by the allegations of the petition, the plaintiff could not demand, and could not require, that the certificate of the ordinary be in a particular form.</div><div class="casepar">The petition nowhere alleges that the ordinary did not certify that he had "no clerk," or that he "was acting himself as the clerk of his own court," or that he was "also the clerk of that court." Certain facts are required by  24-1804 (11) to appear in the certificate of the ordinary, but these facts could be made to appear in various forms of a certificate, and, in so far as appears from any allegation in the petition, the essential facts may have been stated by the ordinary in the certificate which he attached to the papers requested. The petition failed to state a cause of action for mandamus, and the court erred in overruling the general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">The decisions of this court in Lay v. Sheppard, supra, Sellers v. Page, supra, and Smallwood v. Kimball, supra, are correct and sound in so far as they hold that it is the duty of the ordinaries in certifying copies of records from their offices, "when the ordinary and the clerk are the same person, so to state in the certificates." This is the requirement of the Code, and was the law at the time the Lay case was decided in 1900. The language appearing in  24-1804 (11) was incorporated in the Codes of 1863, 1882, and 1895, in exactly the same language and form as it appears in the Code of 1933. The writer does not agree, however, that a certificate by the ordinary would not be admissible in evidence in this State "unless it is made affirmatively to appear that there is no clerk other than the ordinary."</div><div class="casepar">In Witzel v. Pierce, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. 112</span>, this court held that a certificate: "Given under my hand, and seal of office, this, August the 7th, 1854. Joseph Gar, Ordinary, D. C.," was a proper certificate. In Lay v. Sheppard, supra, at page 113, this court distinguished Witzel v. Pierce on the ground that there had been a change in the law. Section 4250 of the "present Civil Code" as referred to by the court in Lay v. Sheppard, supra, is in the identical language of  24-1804 (11), Code of 1933. It must be conceded that by  4250 of the Code of 1895, and by  344 of the Code of 1882, there had been an additional fact required of ordinaries in their certificates to transcripts of records from their offices.</div><div class="casepar">If an ordinary fails to comply with the requirements of the Code,  24-1804 (11), in that the certificate contains no reference to a clerk of his court, would the ordinary's certificate be inadmissible in evidence in the courts of this State?</div><div class="casepar">Under the Constitution of 1945, art. 6, sec. 6, par. 1 (Code, Ann.,  2-4101), the office of ordinary of this State is a constitutional office. Likewise, under the Constitution of 1877, art. 6, sec. 6, par. 1, the office of ordinary was a constitutional office.</div><div class="casepar">In Bailey v. McAlpin, <span class="casemissing">122 Ga. 616</span>, 619 (50 S. E. 388), it was held: "The courts of this State are bound to take judicial notice of who are the public officers of the State holding under commissions issued by the Governor. Ponder v. Shumans, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. 506 (2)</span> (5 S. E. 502); Abrams v. State, <span class="casemissing">121 Ga. 170</span> (48 S. E. 965). The ordinaries of the several counties of this State are commissioned by the Governor . . . Judicial notice will be taken of the fact that he was the incumbent of that office at the time of the official acts alleged to have been performed by him." The same rule is stated in Ponder v. Shumans, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. 506 (2)</span>, which was decided prior to Lay v. Sheppard, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Since ordinaries are constitutional officers, commissioned by the Governor, and the courts of this State are bound to take judicial notice of the fact that the incumbent in an office of ordinary is the holder of that office, his certificate to public records in his office should be admissible upon the trial of any cause in the several courts of this State (when such records are germane to issues on trial). The fact that an ordinary may not furnish the information in his certificate as to whether or not he has a clerk, should not invalidate the certificate by the ordinary, where it is otherwise complete.</div><div class="casepar">Where the ordinary's certificate is attached to copies of records germane to an issue on trial in another State, it then is material whether or not the ordinary has a clerk. Duly authenticated copies, under acts of Congress, for introduction in evidence in courts of another State are properly required to be in more detail than is required where the copies are to be offered in evidence in this State on the certificate of an official judicially recognized.</div><div class="casepar">The writer, therefore, reaches the conclusion that a certificate by an ordinary in the form set out in Witzel v. Pierce, supra, is sufficient to authorize the introduction of the copies so certified in evidence in any court of this State, and that the requirement that the ordinary certify as to who is acting as clerk of his court is not, mandatory, but purely directive.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Davis &amp; Friedin, for plaintiff in error.</div></div><div class="casechrono">DECIDED FEBRUARY 14, 1950.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="caseinlinks"><div class="header">
