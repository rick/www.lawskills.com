October 29, 1951.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The evidence being substantially the same on the second trial of this case as it was on the first trial, a verdict was demanded for the plaintiff in the amount sued for less the amount of the defendant's setoff, as ruled in C. M. Miller Co. v. Ramey, <span class="casemissing">82 Ga. App. 807</span> (62 S. E. 2d, 768), and the trial judge erred in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">R. L. Ramey sued the C. M. Miller Company Inc. for $116.55 on an account for mops sold to the defendant on August 19, 1949. The defendant filed a plea of setoff for damages arising from the alleged breach of the plaintiff's warrants of title to flour sold to and paid for by the defendant. The pleadings on the first trial of the case are set out in the case of C. M. Miller Co. v. Ramey, <span class="casemissing">82 Ga. App. 807</span> (62 S. E. 2d, 768), where it was held by this court that the breach of warranty was a proper matter of setoff to the suit on account, and that under the evidence, which supported without substantial dispute the allegations of the petition and the plea, a verdict was demanded for the plaintiff in the amount of $7.33, which the defendant had paid into court and which represented the excess of the amount sued for by the plaintiff over the damages claimed in the defendant's setoff.</div><div class="casepar">After the remittitur from this court was entered, the plaintiff tendered an amendment to his petition, denying the allegations of the plea and alleging that the defendant's damages were incurred through its breach of its agreement to dispose of the flour only as animal feed, whereby the flour was seized by the United States. The court allowed this amendment over the objections of the defendant, and the defendant excepted pendente lite.</div><div class="casepar">On the second trial of the case, the defendant admitted a prima facie case for the plaintiff, and no evidence was submitted upon the issue of the account for the mops. The defendant assumed the burden of proof in support of its plea of setoff. The evidence showed the following facts: On or about December 7, 1948, an agent of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration inspected a lot of flour belonging to the plaintiff, and informed the plaintiff that the flour was contaminated and than it should not be sold for human consumption. The plaintiff then offered the lot of flour to the defendant corporation, which was in the feed business, telling the defendant's president, C. M. Miller, that a man had condemned the flour. Miller refused to buy the flour. The plaintiff then went to the Atlanta office of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, where he was also told that he could not sell the flour for anything but hog feed. On his return, the plaintiff informed Miller of this, and on December 15, 1948, the defendant bought 11,450 pounds of the flour at 2 1/2 a pound. The market value of such flour in good condition was 6 a pound. The defendant, from December 22, 1948, to January 7, 1949, sold 910 pounds of the flour, which its employees considered to be free from adulteration, for human consumption and disposed of 5410 pounds of the flour as stock feed. On January 7, 1949, a U. S. deputy marshal came to Ramey, the plaintiff, looking for the flour. Ramey told him that he had sold it to the defendant, and the marshal changed some of the papers and receipts accordingly. The marshal seized the flour remaining in the defendant's possession, amounting to 6040 pounds, under process of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, issued on December 30, 1948, pursuant to the filing on December 29, 1948, of a libel of information by the United States against the flour. The libel of information was verified by the acting chief of the Atlanta station of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration on December 20, 1948.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant intervened and claimed the flour sought to be condemned by the Government as being "adulterated while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce . . . in that it consists wholly or in part of a filthy substance by reason of the presence therein of rodent excreta," under 21 U. S. C. 342 (a) (3). On February 11, 1949, the Federal court awarded the flour to the C. M. Miller Co. Inc., and decreed that the claimant pay the costs of court and the cost of supervision of mixing the flour into stock feed. The defendant paid $42.22 as costs of court in the proceeding, $50 as the reasonable fee of its attorney, and $17 to the Food and Drug Administration for supervising the mixing of the flour into stock feed, and these were the damages claimed in the plea of setoff.</div><div class="casepar">With regard to the representations made during the negotiation of the sale of the flour, C. M. Miller, the defendant's president, testified as follows: "He [Ramey] told me that he had been to Atlanta and talked to the Government, who told him they had nothing against the flour; otherwise, I would not have bought it from him. I did refuse to buy the flour when he first came to see me about it. He told me at that time that there was a Government agent down there examining the flour; that the man did not tell him not to sell it, but he was afraid to sell it himself, and I told him that under the circumstances I would not buy it, and then he came back and wanted to sell me the flour and told me he had been to Atlanta to see the Pure Food and Drug Department of the Government and they told him they did not have anything against the flour. Then I bought it. This flour was not condemned when I bought it. I don't know whether it was contaminated or not . . . When I bought this flour from Mr. Ramey he told me that the Government agent was examining it, but had not condemned it, and had not told him not to sell it, but that he said he would get a fellow to tell him not to. Bob [Ramey] did not tell me that the flour was contaminated. Bob told me that there was a food and drug inspector at his place looking at the flour and that was the reason he wanted to sell it. I made no effort to ascertain whether there was anything against the flour or not. I told him I didn't want the flour if they had anything against it and he assured me they didn't have anything against it. I did not ask the Pure Food and Drug Administration if they had anything against the flour before I bought it, because I was assured by Mr. Ramey that they had nothing against it. Mr. Ramey did not tell me when he came to my place the first day about the flour, that they had condemned it. He told me there was a man down there who examined it. I said, 'Did he serve any papers on you?' and he said, 'No.' He said the fellow said that he could not tell him not to sell it, but he could get a man mighty quick to tell him not to sell it. I told him that I didn't want it as long as the Government had anything to do with it, and that is when he went off and came back in two or three days and said he had been to Atlanta and they told him they didn't have anything against it. I would not have bought the flour had I known it was condemned and that the Government was bringing or would bring condemnation proceedings; I would not have defended the case for it."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff, R. L. Ramey, testified as follows concerning the negotiations for the sale of the flour: "After this man inspected the flour, I saw Mr. Miller within twenty-four hours from then and discussed the condition of the flour with him. I told him that a man had condemned the flour, and he had not only condemned part of it but had condemned all of it. In Atlanta they told me that I could not sell the flour for anything but hog feed and I told Mr. Miller that. When I sold this flour to Mr. Miller it was with the understanding that it would be put in feed. I sold the flour to him at such a low price because I could not sell it without being prosecuted. I made this known to him at the time I sold him the flour. I do not know whether the agent left any written notice with me that the flour was contaminated. He might have; he left the impression it had. He told me what happened about the flour, and I told him at the time--I said, 'I am going up to see Mr. Miller and see if I can't sell it without coming down here.' When I got back from Atlanta I reported to Mr. Miller and told him that I would sell the flour to him at two and a half cents a pound; it was condemned. I did not tell him condemnation was pending. He would not have bought it. I told him that there was nothing against the flour as long as it was sold for hog feed and not for human consumption. He [the person inspecting the flour on December 7, 1948] said he had the position of deputy marshal, and he examined the flour. I had turned the lights off, and he turned them on, and some of it was bad. I said, 'Let me take it out and sell it; I won't be able to fill a flour order tomorrow.' He said the flour was condemned, and would have taken me down if I had sold it. I did sell it, but I sold it for hog feed. I didn't tell Mr. Miller that there was no proceeding pending, and then no Federal proceeding pending against the flour when it was sold. I said all the time it was bad flour, and I told him all the time why I wanted to sell it at that price. I did not tell Mr. Miller the condemnation proceeding was pending. It was already condemned. I don't know what you call pending. Of course it had to go through the court. I didn't tell him it would be necessary that he file a claim to that flour. I was selling the flour for hog feed and if the Government took it, why should I object?"</div><div class="casepar">The defendant excepted pendente lite to the refusal of the court to allow the reading of the opinion of this court on the first appeal of the case, in answer to what was contended to be improper argument by the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount sued for. The defendant moved for a new trial, and excepted to the overruling of its motion.</div><div class="casepar"> It appears that, at the time of the sale on December 15, 1948, the plaintiff knew that the flour was subject to condemnation as being unfit for human consumption, and he was under the impression that it had already been condemned. He represented to the defendant at the time he sold the flour to the defendant that the Government had nothing against the flour as long as it was sold for hog feed and not for human consumption. The agent of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration had already examined the flour, and on December 20, 1948, the libel of the United States against the flour was verified by the acting chief of the said Atlanta division of the Food and Drug Administration. The libel was filed on December 29, 1948, and on January 7, 1949, the deputy marshal came to the plaintiff's place of business to seize the flour, but was informed by the plaintiff that the flour was in the defendant's possession.</div><div class="casepar">There is nothing in the record to show that the condemnation proceeding was commenced by the Government authorities because the defendant had sold some 910 pounds of the flour for human consumption, as contended by the plaintiff. It is not shown that any of the Government authorities concerned knew about this, but on the contrary, the condemnation papers showed that the flour was thought to be still in the plaintiff's possession, and the plaintiff was apparently the first to inform the Government agents that the flour was in the defendant's possession on January 7, 1949. It was undisputed that the defendant first sold some of the flour, which its employees had determined to be uncontaminated, to the retail trade for consumption by humans, on December 22, 1948, after the libel against the flour had been verified on December 20, 1948, and thus after the decision to commence the condemnation proceedings had been made.</div><div class="casepar">The seizure of the flour by the deputy marshal was a breach of the representation by Ramey, in the nature of a warranty of title, that the Government had nothing against the flour as long as it was sold for hog feed. It appeared that the expenses of securing the release of the flour were made so that it could be used for this purpose, as it was decreed by the District Court that the defendant should also pay the cost of inspection and supervision, by an agent of the Food and Drug Administration, of mixing the flour into stock feed.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence was substantially the same on the second trial of the case as it was on the first. Therefore, the case is controlled by the ruling on its previous appearance in this court, that a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $7.33 was demanded, with costs accruing after the defendant's payment of this amount into court to be assessed against the plaintiff, and that the court erred in overruling the defendant's motion for a new trial on the general grounds. C. M. Miller Co. v. Ramey, <span class="casemissing">82 Ga. App. 807</span> (62 S. E. 2d, 768). Under these circumstances, the special grounds of the motion for a new trial, complaining of the charge of the court to the jury, need not be considered. It was not error to allow the amendment to the petition, setting up matter in replication to and in denial of the plea of setoff. Mashburn Drug Co. v. Valdosta Drug Co., <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. App. 88</span>, 97 (184 S. E. 903); Murphey v. Harker, <span class="casemissing">115 Ga. 77</span>, 90 (41 S. E. 585). The court did not err in refusing to allow the opinion of this court in the first appeal of the case to be read to the jury. Hudson v. Hudson, <span class="casemissing">90 Ga. 581 (3)</span> (16 S.
