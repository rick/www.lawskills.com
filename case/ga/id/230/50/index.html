("Health Horizons") filed a complaint for fraud against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company ("State Farm") in the DeKalb Superior Court. In paragraph 3, Health Horizons mistakenly alleged that it "is a Georgia corporation." In its answer and defensive pleadings, State Farm did not raise any issue of the standing of Health Horizons to sue in Georgia, although it was a foreign corporation that transacted business in Georgia without a certificate of authority. After discovery and various discovery motions, it was revealed that Health Horizons did not have a certificate of authority; promptly, on May 26, 1998, a certificate of authority was obtained, and on June 10, 1998, the complaint was amended to reflect that Health Horizons was a foreign corporation transacting business in Georgia under a certificate of authority. On June 15, 1998, State Farm amended its answer to raise for the first time that Health Horizons lacked the capacity to sue because it was a foreign corporation transacting business in Georgia since January 1, 1995, had first obtained a certificate of authority on May 26, 1998, but had filed this suit on August 8, 1997. Subsequently, on July 20, 1998, State Farm filed its motion to dismiss for failure to have a certificate of authority at the time of filing the complaint.</div><div class="casepar">Health Horizons is engaged in the practice of corporate medicine which State Farm contends is the unauthorized practice of corporate medicine. Health Horizons is a foreign for-profit business corporation that "furnishes health care services" for which it seeks to collect from State Farm. Health Horizons contends that it is not engaged in the practice of medicine but receives payment of fees arising from the practice of medicine by Ken G. Knott, M.D. State Farm contends that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/34/26/index.html">43-34-26</a></span> (a) and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/34/43/index.html">43-34-43</a></span> and the rules of the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners prohibit the practice of medicine by a for-profit business corporation. On July 20, 1998, State Farm's motion on such grounds was denied.</div><div class="casepar">Hearing on the motion was held on November 2, 1998, and the trial court granted the motion and dismissed without prejudice. Health Horizons filed its notice of appeal. On December 3, 1998, State Farm filed its notice of cross-appeal.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A99A0882</div><div class="casepar">The sole enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss for failure to have a certificate of authority at the time the complaint was filed.

"[T]he purpose of [OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1501/index.html">14-2-1501</a></span> (a)] is to require registration of foreign corporations which intend to conduct business in Georgia on a continuous basis, not as a temporary matter."

These are the underlying reasons for such statutory scheme.</div><div class="casepar">Under a similar statutory scheme, the Georgia Nonresident Contractors Act ("NCA"), the nonresident contractor must register with the State Revenue Commissioner and post a bond for tax liabilities incurred for income earned in the state from the contract and any other taxes due. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/13/31/index.html">48-13-31</a></span>. A certificate of authority from the Secretary of State does not exempt a nonresident contractor from registration with the State Revenue Commissioner. See George C. Carroll Constr. Co. v.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/13/37/index.html">48-13-37</a></span>, like OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1502/index.html">14-2-1502</a></span> (a), provides that: "[n]o contractor who fails to register with the commissioner as required by this article or who fails to comply with any provision of this article shall be entitled to maintain an action to recover payment for performance on the contract in the courts of this state." "The purpose of the NCA is revenue collection enhancement or, in other words, protection of the State and its political subdivisions from nonresident contractors who leave the State without paying their taxes and unemployment contributions.

"The statutory scheme contemplates the possibility of cure by allowing late registration and bonding. Additionally, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/1/3/1/index.html">1-3-1</a></span> (c) provides that substantial compliance with any statutory requirement shall be deemed and held sufficient." (Punctuation omitted.) Id. at 370. In Dept. of Transp. v. Moseman Constr.

The contractor's performance bond provided for payment of all taxes and the contractor ultimately complied with the NCA prior to the contract completion.

Where a statute directs that a thing be done in a certain time without negative words prohibiting the subsequent performance, generally, the provision of time is directory only; where no injury results from such delay, subsequent performance is deemed substantial compliance with the statutory requirements.

L. 1988, pp. 1070, 1225-1226,  1, the General Assembly changed the language of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1421/index.html">14-2-1421</a></span> (b) of the 1969 Georgia Corporate Code that provided "unless before commencement of the action a certificate of authority shall have been obtained by such corporation," no action can be brought at all.

(Emphasis supplied.) Ga. L. 1968, pp. 565, 790. "This section is based upon Model Act Section 117, with minor changes. It covers approximately the same ground once covered by Ga. Code Ann., former [Ga. Code Ann.]  22-1506, but differs from the latter in two important respects: (1) Under subsection (b) of the new section, no foreign corporation transacting business in this State without a certificate of authority is entitled to maintain suit in the Georgia courts on any cause of action arising out of its business in Georgia. Once it obtains a certificate, however, a suit previously filed by it may be continued without refiling." Comment, 22 Code of Ga. Ann., p. 190,  22-1421 (1968). Prior to 1968, there was no forum preclusion at all. Only with Ga. L. 1969, pp. 152, 196,  76, did dismissal, despite late compliance, become part of the Georgia Business Corporate Code. However, under Ga. L. 1988, pp. 1070, 1225-1226,  1, the statutory scheme returned to the pre-1969 statutory approach: prohibiting "maintaining a proceeding in any court in this state until it obtains a certificate of authority." See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1502/index.html">14-2-1502</a></span> (a). Such is a return to the pre-1969 law.</div><div class="casepar">A "revising statute is in effect a legislative declaration that whatever is embraced in the new statute shall prevail, and whatever is excluded therefrom shall be discarded." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Thompson v. Ga. Power Co., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 587</span>, 596 (<span class="casemissing">37 SE2d 622</span>) (1946); accord George C. Carroll Constr. Co. v. Langford Constr. Co., supra at 261. Any reason for dismissal for continuing noncompliance ceased to exist at the moment of issue of the certificate of authority, and Health Horizons has substantially complied with the statutory scheme. Thus, the statutory purpose was satisfied by compelling the certificate of authority. Therefore, there no longer exists a legislative purpose in denial of the right to maintain an action, as late substantial compliance is recognized. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/1/3/1/index.html">1-3-1</a></span> (c); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1501/index.html">14-2-1501</a></span> (a); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/2/1502/index.html">14-2-1502</a></span> (a).</div><div class="casepar">In Tillett Bros. Constr. Co. v. Dept. of Transp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../309/99/index.html">210 Ga.

A foreign corporation had a certificate of authority at the time of suit and at the time business was transacted in Georgia, but it had ceased to transact business in Georgia and did not maintain its certificate of authority at the time it brought a renewal action.

State Farm contends that Health Horizons has made admissions in judicio in the complaint that it practices medicine, i.e., that it "furnishes health care services." If such statement constitutes an admission in judicio, then Health Horizons cannot present evidence to contravene such admission unless and until the admission is withdrawn by amendment. Thus, Dr. Knott's affidavit must be excluded, State Farm would have pierced Health Horizons' pleadings without any proper rebuttal evidence by the respondent.</div><div class="casepar">State Farm contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion, because Health Horizons was engaged in the practice of medicine. Its basis for this position is what it contends was an admission in judicio, i.e., "furnishes health care services," that Health Horizons was engaged in the practice of medicine. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">(a) "[F]urnishes health care services" is not a statement of fact but is an opinion or conclusion as to law, fact, or mixed question of both as to relationships and to a series of transactions or occurrences over time; it is a conclusory statement so broadly made that it may encompass the practice of medicine, physical therapy, nursing, practical nursing, some other form of health services for compensation, or furnishing of medical supplies and equipment. "Although admissions in judicio apply only to admissions of fact and do not apply when the admission is merely the opinion or conclusion of the pleader as to fact or law," such statement cannot constitute an admission in judicio, because it fails to be a statement of fact.

However, "health care services" is defined in the Insurance Code, using such words, in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/20/3/index.html">33-20-3</a></span> (4)</div><div class="casepar">means the examination or treatment of persons for the prevention of illness or the correction or treatment of any physical or mental condition resulting from illness, injury, or other human physical problem and includes but is not limited to: (A) Hospital services which include the general and usual care, services, supplies and equipment furnished by hospitals; (B) Medical services which include the general and usual services and care rendered and administered by doctors of medicine, doctors of dental surgery, and doctors of podiatry; and (C) Other health care services which include appliances and supplies; nursing care by a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse; care furnished by such other licensed practitioners as may be expressly approved by the board of directors from time to time; institutional services including the general and usual care, services, supplies, and equipment furnished by health care institutions and agencies . . . other than hospitals; physiotherapy; ambulance services; drugs and medications; therapeutic services and equipment including oxygen and the rental of oxygen equipment; hospital beds; iron lungs; orthopedic services and appliances including wheelchairs, trusses, braces, crutches, and prosthetic devices including artificial limbs and eyes; and any other appliance, supply, or service related to health care.</div><div class="casepar">Since the phrase "health care services" was used in a suit against an insurance company regarding the failure to pay for health care services rendered, then it clearly had the expansive statutory meaning. Therefore, the scope of meaning is so broad and expansive that it cannot be construed as having the narrow meaning ascribed to it by State Farm of practice of medicine as an admission in judicio. At most, such phrase creates a conflict in evidence as to the meaning.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court admitted the affidavit of Dr. Knott by considering the affidavit of Dr. Knott; such admission of evidence in conflict to the purported admission in judicio is deemed as an amendment to conform to the evidence, which has the effect of withdrawing such admission in judicio.

Hale, supra at 796, held that "[a]lthough it is true that a business corporation cannot lawfully practice one of the so-called 'learned professions,' [cit.], it does not follow that a corporation violating this prohibition is 'void.' " Thus, State Farm lacks standing to raise as a defense that Health Horizons was engaged in the practice of medicine as a for-profit corporation, because such violation does not void any assigned contracts with it or any right of action for quantum meruit for services performed for which it had financial responsibility. Id. Further, only the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners or its designees have standing to take action against Health Horizons, if it was in fact practicing medicine as a corporation.
