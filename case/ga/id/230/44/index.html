Before Judge Langford, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">After extensive discovery, all the defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. On August 6, 1998, oral argument was held. On August 11, 1998, the trial court granted summary judgment on all counts against the plaintiffs. On December 10, 1998, the trial court granted Dr. Chase's motion for summary judgment as well. Plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal.</div><div class="casepar">The record shows that Howard was a diabetic with hypertension. By policy, the intake screening in the Muscogee County jail was performed by a deputy with no medical training who did not take a medical history for diabetes or hypertension and looked only for observable physical conditions or injuries. Thus, Howard's jail records did not flag his medical condition. After his incarceration on October 1, 1991, lack of proper diet and medication caused Howard's diabetic condition to worsen over time. By April 1992, Howard's diabetic condition had deteriorated to the extent that he appeared visibly sick to a lay person.</div><div class="casepar">On April 23, 1992, Howard's cellmate, Melson, prepared a sick-call slip for Howard, because Howard was too weak to do it for himself. Within the week, Melson prepared two or three more sick-call slips for Howard. By the first week in May, Howard experienced symptoms of overheating, craving of water, dizziness, constipation, and fainting. After one fainting spell, Howard was examined in the cell by a deputy. At other times, when the cellmates told the jailors that Howard was seriously sick or had fainted, the jailors did not even look at him or do anything to determine if he was sick. Howard lost considerable weight, i.e., 30 to 40 pounds, and had a shrunken face, indicating to a lay person that he was profoundly sick and had a serious medical need.</div><div class="casepar">On May 22, 1992, Officer J. V. Kennedy learned that Howard was sick. Kennedy talked by telephone to LPN Mildred Chapman in the clinic at 8:30 a.m. Chapman did nothing. Kennedy called again at 10:30 a.m., but Chapman said that the clinic was full. At 2:00 p.m., Kennedy saw Chapman in person and told her that Howard appeared very sick and in serious need of medical care. Chapman refused to see Howard. Kennedy was sufficiently concerned over Howard's condition that he notified his supervisor, Lt. Wanda Clemmons, about Howard and Chapman's refusal to see Howard. Clemmons merely told him to prepare a written report of the incident. This was another policy or procedure of the jail regarding medical care.</div><div class="casepar">On May 23, 1992, at 8:00 a.m., Howard manifested symptoms of profound weight loss, total absence of appetite, slurred speech, lethargy, fainting, blurred vision, and profound weakness. He had to be carried to the clinic. Howard had a heart rate of 148 beats per minute. Although the protocol required that 911 be called when a prisoner's heart rate exceeded 120 bpm, LPN Lawrence Thompson did not call 911 or Dr. Chase, but gave Howard medication for high blood pressure that had been preapproved for such general use. However, such medication was dangerous for a diabetic. Howard was kept in the clinic from 11:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., when he was returned to his cell. Howard was never seen by a physician. At 11:00 p.m., Howard was returned to the clinic. He told LPN Ava McLeod that he was dying. At that time, he had an unsteady gait, blurry vision, faintness, a heart rate of 126 bpm, and a rebounding pulse of 136 bpm. The LPN did not call an ambulance or Dr. Chase, but continued to treat him only for high blood pressure by changing the blood pressure medication.</div><div class="casepar">After Howard's return to the clinic at 11:00 p.m. on May 23, 1992, Deputy Gary Nicholson observed Howard in the holding cell and observed that Howard appeared "rough," in distress, lethargic, incoherent, and thirsty. Howard had an overwhelming odor of sweet ammonia about him. LPN McLeod told Nicholson that she thought that Howard was a diabetic. While LPNs had the authority to call 911 for an ambulance, the policy was that, because of cost, an ambulance was not to be called except in the case of a medical emergency. LPN McLeod consulted by telephone with Dr. Chase, who was on call. Dr. Chase neither came to the clinic to examine Howard nor ordered that Howard be sent to the emergency room at the hospital. By telephone, Dr. Chase ordered a change in blood pressure medication without knowing Howard's clinical signs and symptoms.</div><div class="casepar">After 6:30 a.m. Sunday, May 24, 1992, Howard was returned to his cell by LPN Thompson. Howard told his cellmate Melson that he was dying. The cellmates created a commotion to get the deputies to do something about Howard, because Howard appeared to them to be critically ill. At 7:00 a.m., LPN Thompson arrived with a deputy at the cell, and Howard was again carried to the clinic. At 1:40 p.m., Howard's father and sister came to the jail, and Howard was taken to the visitors area, but Howard could not talk and fainted. Howard was then returned to the clinic. At 1:55 p.m., Howard's heart rate increased to 144 bpm, and his blood pressure dropped. A jailor became sufficiently concerned that he called 911; LPN McLeod called Dr. Chase to tell him that the deputy had called for the paramedics. Dr. Chase did not come to the jail.</div><div class="casepar">At 2:10 p.m. on May 24, 1992, as a result of the telephone call from the jailor, two paramedics, Jim Waites and William Moore, arrived. They immediately detected acetone on Howard's breath. Howard was in a near coma and in a wheelchair. He was lethargic and could not keep his eyes open; he was non-responsive to voice commands and responded only to pain; and he lacked a grasp. The paramedics administered a simple glucose fingerstick test, which registered the maximum for glucose. Based on this simple test, it was their immediate opinion that Howard was diabetic. At the hospital, Howard registered 1200+ on the blood workup.</div><div class="casepar">At 1:00 a.m. on May 25, 1992, after removal from the jail to the Medical Center, Howard stopped breathing. He died at 1:20 a.m. Held:</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A99A0680</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs set forth six enumerations of error, all of which state different reasons why the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants. For a proper analysis, the theories of liability must be examined on the basis of federal and state claims.</div><div class="casepar">1. The plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Howard's 42 USCA  1983 claims for violating Howard's rights under: (a) the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, i.e., grossly inadequate medical care and failure to treat Howard, and (b) the Due Process Clause. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Liability on an action under 42 USCA  1983 prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment as a violation of Eighth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution exists through "acts [and] omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs," of an inmate in jail. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 106 (97 SC 285, 50 LE2d 251) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">Not every governmental action affecting the interests or well-being of a prisoner is subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny. After incarceration, only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. To be cruel and unusual punishment, conduct that does not purport to be punishment at all must involve more than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner's interests or safety. It is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, whether that conduct occurs in connection with establishing conditions of confinement, supplying medical needs, or restoring official control over a tumultuous cellblock. . . .

Gamble, supra, it must be shown that [Howard's] treatment was "so grossly incompetent, inadequate or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness or where the medical care is so inappropriate as to evidence intentional maltreatment or a refusal to provide essential care." Rogers v. Evans, 792 F2d 1052, 1058 (11th Cir. 1986).</div><div class="casepar">Alford v. Osei-Kwasi, supra at 722-723 (6); accord Cantrell v. Thurman, supra at 512; Webb v. Carroll County, supra. "Also, delay in access to medical care that is tantamount to unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain may constitute deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Adams v. Poag, 61 F3d 1537, 1544 (11th Cir. 1995); see also Brown v. Hughes, 894 F2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir. 1990). "If [jailors] delay or deny access to medical care . . ., the [E]ighth [A]mendment is violated. . . . [A] refusal to provide essential care violates the [E]ighth [A]mendment." Rogers v. Evans, supra at 1058.</div><div class="casepar">All [Eighth Amendment medical] cases require knowledge of the medical needs of the plaintiff and the intentional refusal to provide such necessary care in order for such conduct to constitute "deliberate indifference" as an Eighth Amendment violation within Estelle. Our cases have consistently held that "knowledge of the need for medical care" and "an intentional refusal to provide that care" constitute "deliberate indifference." . . . Carswell v. Bay County, 854 F2d 454, 457 (11th Cir. 1988); Ancata v. Prison Health Svcs., 769 F2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985).</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis omitted.) Merritt v.

Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 837 (B) (1) (114 SC 1970, 128 LE2d 811) (1994); accord Yizar v. Ault, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../248/9/index.html">265 Ga. 708</a></span>, 709 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../248/9/index.html">462 SE2d 141</a></span>) (1995); Merritt v. Athens Clarke County, supra at 208.</div><div class="casepar">However, "an Eighth Amendment claimant need not show that a [jailor] acted or failed to act believing that harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm." Farmer v. Brennan, supra at 842. "To state an Eighth Amendment violation for inadequate medical care under Estelle v. Gamble, supra, it must be shown that [Howard's] treatment was 'so grossly incompetent, inadequate or excessive . . . or [was] a refusal to provide essential care.' [Cit.]" Alford v. Osei-Kwasi, supra at 722-723 (6). Thus, knowledge for the purpose of deliberate indifference means an awareness that the inmate needs medical care because of a serious risk of harm from illness or injury, as evidenced by the clinical signs and symptoms that are readily observable by a reasonable person. Knowledge for the purpose of deliberate indifference does not require a final diagnosis, correct diagnosis, or a complete medical history when the inmate has not been allowed to see and to be examined by a physician or when medical care has been unreasonably delayed. Adams v. Poag, supra at 1544; Brown v. Hughes, supra at 1538; Carswell v. Bay County, supra at 457.</div><div class="casepar">Such knowledge may be shown by circumstantial evidence by demonstrating that the surrounding facts and circumstances are such that a reasonable person would know and appreciate the risk of harm from a serious medical need, unless they were deliberately indifferent. A defendant will rarely make the admission of an awareness and appreciation that the inmate was in serious need of medical care to avoid the risk of harm, because to do so is an admission of subjective indifference, i.e., admission of a culpable state of mind and liability. Merritt v. Athens Clarke County, supra at 208. "[W]hen the need for medical treatment is obvious, medical care that is so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all may constitute deliberate indifference." (Citation omitted.) Adams v. Poag, supra at 1544; accord Ancata v. Prison Health Svcs., supra at 704. "A medical need is serious if it is '. . . one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.' [Cits.]" Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980). "A series of incidents closely related in time may disclose a pattern of conduct amounting to deliberate indifference. Repeated examples of delayed or denied medical care may indicate a deliberate indifference by prison authorities to the suffering that results." (Citations omitted.) Rogers v. Evans, supra at 1058-1059; accord Todaro v. Ward, 565 F2d 48, 52 (2nd Cir. 1977); Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir. 1991); Ramos v. Lamm, supra at 575. "When [jail guards or medical personnel] ignore without explanation a prisoner's serious medical condition that is known or obvious to them, the trier of fact may infer deliberate indifference." (Citations omitted.) Brown v. Hughes, supra at 1538. Therefore, such subjective deliberate indifference may be proven as a reasonable inference drawn from circumstantial evidence of the surrounding facts and circumstances.</div><div class="casepar">(i) In this case, repeatedly denying an obviously sick inmate with a serious medical need access to a physician or a hospital emergency room where proper medical diagnosis and treatment can be made does not escape from the Eighth Amendment prohibition against denial of medical care simply because neither jailors nor paramedical personnel know what is specifically wrong with the inmate, other than that he is seriously sick. Adams v. Poag, supra; Brown v. Hughes, supra. Such repeated and prolonged denial of access to a physician for an obviously seriously sick inmate constitutes deliberate indifference and reckless conduct. Farmer v. Brennan, supra at 842. Ignorance is not bliss; otherwise, a premium would be placed upon ignorance in order to escape liability when an illness is not diagnosed and the sufferer is allowed to slowly die without proper diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, repeated denial, delay, insufficient or inappropriate medical care of an obviously sick inmate in serious need of medical care constitutes circumstantial evidence of subjective, deliberate indifference. See Whitley v. Albers, supra at 321; Estelle v. Gamble, supra at 103-104; Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 296-299 (111 SC 2321, 115 LE2d 271) (1991); Anderson v. City of Atlanta, 778 F2d 678, 686, n. 12 (11th Cir. 1985); Merritt v. Athens Clarke County, supra at 208.</div><div class="casepar">Here, jail LPNs deliberately ignored the pleas of Howard, his cellmates, and deputies either to have a physician examine Howard or to send him to the hospital, and -- finally -- a medically untrained deputy was forced to call 911 for paramedics; such evidence (plus the evidence of the serious medical needs of Howard from the same witnesses) constitutes some circumstantial evidence of their culpable state of mind, i.e., subjective deliberate indifference, because such acts or omissions are not negligent but require a conscious decision to act or not to act. See Merritt v. Athens Clarke County, supra at 208; Van Alstine v. Merritt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../276/15/index.html">222 Ga. App. 734</a></span>, 735 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../276/15/index.html">476 SE2d 6</a></span>) (1996); Johnson v.

Howard was never examined by a physician in the jail clinic from April 23, 1992, through May 25, 1992, when he died. Howard was seen only by under-trained LPNs under the practices and policies promulgated by the defendants. It was only after Howard reached a diabetic stupor that a jailor, not jail medical personnel, called 911 for an ambulance to transport Howard to the hospital emergency room. When the paramedics examined Howard, they immediately suspected diabetes from the acetone smell on Howard's breath, his respiration, and his non-responsiveness except to pain. Therefore, the paramedics administered a simple fingerstick glucose test that showed the maximum glucose level possible of 400+ on that device, indicating diabetes. Thus, Howard's critical medical condition was obvious to a properly trained paramedic. The LPNs should have recognized earlier the clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes or realized, at the minimum, that this profoundly sick inmate needed to see a physician. This was a violation of a constitutional right that was coupled with causation.</div><div class="casepar">The Supreme Court . . . set forth an analysis of the "under-color-of-state-law" part of the . . . two-part requirement.

The deprivation must be caused by: (i) The exercise of some right or privilege created by the state, or (ii) a rule of conduct imposed by the state, or (iii) a person for whom the state is responsible. B. The party charged with the deprivation must be a "state actor" in that: (i) He is a state official, or (ii) he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or (iii) his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the state.

His primary duty in this instance was to his patient rather than to the city. Keenan v. Plouffe, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../193/1/index.html">267 Ga. 791</a></span>, 794 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../193/1/index.html">482 SE2d 253</a></span>) (1997); see also Davis v.

A physician's professional standing creates a trusting relationship that cannot be breached with impunity. A professional person is liable for an abuse of the trust reposed in him by the public, provisions of the compensation notwithstanding. A prisoner is compelled to trust that his treatment will be made by the doctor's independent professional judgment. Because of the relationship between physicians and patients, jail physicians cannot use the sovereign immunity law as a shield to insulate themselves from individual liability for medical malpractice claims. Keenan v. Plouffe, supra at 795.</div><div class="casepar">Since Dr. Chase failed to go to the jail and examine or treat Howard or to have him transferred to the hospital, instead choosing to order a change in medication without knowing all of the clinical signs and symptoms that a reasonable examination would disclose, there was no exercise of discretion as to Howard's diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, Swofford v. Cooper, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/48/index.html">184 Ga. App. 50</a></span>, 52-53 (1), (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/48/index.html">360 SE2d 624</a></span>) (1987), aff'd, Cooper v. Swofford, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../465/6/index.html">258 Ga. 143 (368 SE2d 518) (1988)</a></span>, and Roberts v. Grigsby, supra at 379-383 (Deen, P. J., concurring specially), which deal with the exercise of discretion, are inapplicable to this case. Swofford v. Cooper, supra, did not deal with a medical diagnosis or treatment, but with a decision to allow a psychiatric leave as part of therapy. Likewise, in Roberts v. Grigsby, supra, the chief of psychology made the decision to allow a psychiatric patient to be released.</div><div class="casepar">The case against Dr. Chase is supported by an expert opinion that he deviated from the standard of care in failing to go to the jail after hearing the clinical signs from the nurse at 11:00 p.m. on May 23, 1992. He failed to examine, treat, or transfer Howard to the hospital. Therefore, there existed a material issue of fact for jury determination. Thus, this was a simple medical malpractice action for failure to examine, treat, or transfer. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Dr. Chase.</div><div class="casepar">5. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their renewed motion for sanctions.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs sought to strike Sheriff Hodge's answer for wilful failure to comply with a discovery order. The trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, on plaintiffs' renewed motion for sanctions denied the ultimate sanction of striking the defensive pleadings and entering a default judgment against Hodge.</div><div class="casepar">Dismissal of the answer and entry of a default judgment against a defendant who is in wilful, in bad faith, or in conscious disregard of an order compelling discovery are an appropriate sanction. Didio v. Chess, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../286/60/index.html">218 Ga. App. 550</a></span>, 551 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../286/60/index.html">462 SE2d 450</a></span>) (1995); Smith v. Nat.

Neither the movant nor the trial court need find actual wilfulness, but only a conscious or intentional act in disregarding the duty to make discovery is necessary for imposing the sanction of default. Resource Network Intl. v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../248/49/index.html">232 Ga. App. 242 (1) (501 SE2d 573) (1998)</a></span>; Potter v.

(Citations and punctuation omitted.) West v. Equifax Credit Information Svcs., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/97/index.html">230 Ga. App. 41</a></span>, 42 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/97/index.html">495 SE2d 300</a></span>) (1997). The appellate courts refuse to interfere with a trial court's exercise of its broad discretion, in the absence of abuse under the discovery provisions of the Civil Practice Act. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../262/95/index.html">226 Ga. App. 34</a></span>, 38 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../262/95/index.html">486 SE2d 180</a></span>) (1997). The trial court should attempt to compel compliance with its orders through the imposition of sanctions less than dismissal. The drastic sanctions of dismissal and default are imposed only in the most flagrant cases -- where the failure is wilful, in bad faith, or in conscious disregard of an order. However, a very broad discretion is granted judges in applying sanctions to assure compliance with court orders. Joel v. Duet Holdings, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../411/67/index.html">181 Ga.

Vlasz v. Schweikhardt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../421/40/index.html">178 Ga. App. 512</a></span>, 516-517 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../421/40/index.html">343 SE2d 749</a></span>) (1986); Hohlstein v. White, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../635/87/index.html">117 Ga. App. 207 (1) (160 SE2d 232) (1968)</a></span>. Where no sanction has been imposed in a flagrant case and there was no evidence of a legitimate excuse before the trial court, this Court will "remand for reconsideration and the imposition of such sanctions as the trial court deems appropriate." Vlasz v. Schweikhardt, supra at 517. Even so, it is for the trial court, from all the facts and circumstances, to decide what sanction is appropriate. Therefore, the trial court in this case did not err in denying the imposition of the ultimate sanction of default when it previously imposed other sanctions.</div><div class="casepar">SMITH, Judge, concurring in judgment only in part and dissenting in part.</div><div class="casepar">I concur in the result reached in Divisions 1, 2 (a), 3, 4, and 5 of the majority, but I do not agree with all that is said in those divisions.

App. 95</a></span>, 96 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/31/index.html">395 SE2d 275</a></span>) (1990). Supervision of a law enforcement agency is generally a discretionary rather than ministerial function. Lowe v. Jones County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/63/index.html">231 Ga. App. 372</a></span>, 373 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/63/index.html">499 SE2d 348</a></span>) (1998) (" 'The operation of a police department, including the degree of training and supervision to be provided its officers, is a discretionary governmental function of the municipality as opposed to a ministerial, proprietary, or administratively routine function.' "). The majority has not demonstrated the basis for its conclusion that Sheriff Hodge's acts were ministerial in nature.</div><div class="casepar">The majority also has failed to set forth any basis for holding that the actions of the licensed practical nurses employed at the jail were ministerial rather than discretionary. Cantrell v. Thurman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/92/index.html">231 Ga. App. 510</a></span>, 514 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/92/index.html">499 SE2d 416</a></span>) (1998), written by the author of the majority, also declares that the general obligation to provide medical care to prisoners is a ministerial act by the sheriff, but the authorities cited therein do not support that assertion. The writer of the majority also proposed this view of ministerial functions in a dissent to Coffey v. Brooks County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/89/index.html">231 Ga. App. 886</a></span>, 895 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/89/index.html">500 SE2d 341</a></span>) (1998), rev'd on other grounds, Rowe v. Coffey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../113/9/index.html">270 Ga. 715 (515 SE2d 375) (1999)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The law as currently established by this court is quite different. In Schmidt v. Adams, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/15/index.html">211 Ga. App. 156</a></span>, 157 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/15/index.html">438 SE2d 659</a></span>) (1993) (full concurrence on issue of discretionary function), we held that the actions of a physician's assistant employed by a jail in failing properly to diagnose a condition and failing to order a timely transfer to a hospital were "based on his examination of the facts, his experience, and the exercise of his best judgment," and therefore were discretionary. The declaration of the existence of a "protocol" does not create a ministerial duty. The medical field has long published diagnostic and procedural manuals that establish criteria and make recommenda-</div><div class="casepar">tions for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The mere publication of such standards, however, does not remove from the practice of medicine or nursing the requirement that, as professionals, nurses examine the facts and exercise judgment, as in Schmidt.</div><div class="casepar">In the recent decision of Edwards v. Dept. of Children &amp;c. Svcs., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../239/46/index.html">236 Ga. App. 696 (512 SE2d 339) (1999)</a></span>, the parents of a deceased inmate alleged that workers and nurses at a youth development center had an absolute, nondiscretionary duty to summon medical aid for their daughter and failed to do so within a reasonable time. We concluded, however, that the "type of care and support and what and how much medical treatment to provide are decisions that must be left to the discretion of the employees who work with the inmates. [Cits.]" Id. at 700. Moreover, Edwards itself relies upon Cantrell, supra, to hold that while the county had a duty to provide medical care and treatment, "what medical care to provide is discretionary and therefore is subject to immunity. [Cit.]" Edwards, supra at 699.</div><div class="casepar">We note that the Supreme Court of Georgia has granted certiorari in Edwards specifically to consider whether this court "improperly expanded the definition of 'discretionary function' found in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/21/22/index.html">50-21-22</a></span>," part of the Georgia Tort Claims Act, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Dept. of Transp. v. Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/4/index.html">267 Ga. 6 (471 SE2d 849) (1996)</a></span>, involving the distinction between design decisions and policy decisions in opening a highway intersection to traffic. But even if the scope of the discretionary function may be altered by the Supreme Court in the near future, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the majority at this time to articulate the reasons for its determination that the decisions made here were ministerial and not discretionary. Moreover, it appears that this result will require that we overrule Lowe and Schmidt and the decisions upon which they rely, because Cantrell is wholly inconsistent with the existing law in Georgia governing ministerial and discretionary acts.</div><div class="casepar">For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent from Division 2 (b) of the majority opinion.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Chief Judge Johnson and Presiding Judge Blackburn join in this opinion.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="casenotes"><div class="header">
