The evidence is sufficient to support the verdict and sentence.</div><div class="casepar">EVANS, Judge.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant appeals from his conviction on four counts of forgery and from the dismissal of his motion for new trial as amended, The main thrust of the appeal is that the trial judge erred in denying defendant's motions for a continuance in the case.</div><div class="casepar">The following statement of facts as shown by the transcript and record is necessary for a decision in this case:</div><div class="casepar">A criminal warrant was issued for the defendant in Wilkes County, charging him with forgery, and he gave bond (bail) for his appearance shortly before the grand jury convened in said county at the August term 1967, at which time the grand jury indicted him for forgery. Three months later, at the succeeding term of Wilkes Superior Court, the case was called for trial, notice of arraignment having been previously given defendant. Thus it will be seen that defendant had three full months in which to engage counsel to represent him in said matter.</div><div class="casepar">After the convening of court on Monday morning (first Monday in November, November 6, 1967), when his case was called, defendant stated to the trial judge in open court that his former attorney, Marion Gaines Hill, did not represent him and the judge allowed him until Tuesday morning to secure an attorney. On Tuesday morning the defendant stated that he had not employed an attorney but would have one in about two minutes as he had previously talked to Attorney Lawson E. Thompson relative to employment. Immediately afterwards, Attorney Thompson stated he was employed the night before to represent him in the case of forgery and also in another criminal charge against the defendant in the same court. It is noted here that Thompson also stated he had talked to the defendant on Friday or Saturday. Attorney Thompson moved for a continuance, pleading his own lack of time for preparation, and as a part of the motion to continue, defendant was sworn and testified that he had previously employed attorneys Leroy Johnson of Atlanta and Marion Gaines Hill of New York, to represent him at the August term 1967 (the term at which the indictment was returned), and said attorneys told him his case was 'thrown out of court." No substantiation of defendant's testimony as to his having been so informed by said attorneys was ever made by either of the attorneys or by any other person.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge overruled the motion to continue and defendant was placed on trial for another offense (a traffic violation case), being represented therein by Attorney Thompson, which trial consumed the balance of that day.</div><div class="casepar">On the following day the forgery case was again called for trial, and Attorney Thompson announced that he no longer represented defendant, and that his representation terminated at the end of the preceding day. No explanation was given as to why such representation was terminated, and thus it may be fairly inferred that defendant voluntarily discharged said attorney.</div><div class="casepar">Then Attorney Maynard Jackson, of the Atlanta Bar, announced that he was appearing on behalf of defendant for the sole purpose of moving for a continuance because of the absence, through illness, of Attorney Marion Gaines Hill of New York (who was defendant's uncle), stating that Attorney Hill represented defendant. It was shown that Attorney Hill dispatched a telegram from New York to the trial judge, advising that he was ill, with no suggestion as to the duration of his illness or when he would he able to try the case.</div><div class="casepar">Attorney Jackson also suggested that there was a witness of defendant's in New York, but no suggestion was made that he was under subpoena; or that he resided in Wilkes County; or that his testimony was material; or that he was not absent by permission; or that his testimony was expected at the next term of court, or that the motion was not made for the purpose of delay, all of which is absolutely required by Code  81-1410, as amended (Ga. L. 1959, p. 342). The absence of this witness will therefore not be considered further in this discussion.</div><div class="casepar">At no time was a temporary postponement of the case requested by defendant, but the motions were to continue the case for the term.</div><div class="casepar">It was shown by the State that the prosecutor was an aged man, that he was in poor health; and that the State had present a witness, resident of New York, at the State's expense, having also had him present at the preceding term of court.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge suggested to Attorney Maynard Jackson that he would allow him the opportunity of completing his showing on the motion for continuance by placing sworn testimony in the record, If he desired, but said attorney did not avail himself of said invitation and no sworn testimony whatever was introduced on Attorney Jackson's motion to continue.</div><div class="casepar">Attorney Jackson stated that he himself was not sufficiently prepared to represent defendant, as he had appeared for the sole purpose of moving for a continuance because of the absence of Attorney Hill, but that he would represent the defendant, and the court ordered a recess of 30 minutes additional time, after which the trial proceeded.</div><div class="casepar">The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty under which the defendant was sentenced to serve two years in prison. A motion for new trial was filed, but no copy of this motion or of the rule nisi therein was ever served upon State's counsel. The motion for new trial was amended, and said amendment was served on State's counsel, and the motion remained in a dormant state for the next two years and nine months. Then the trial judge on his own motion, in writing, notified defendant's counsel and State's counsel to appear in Wilkes Superior Court at Washington at 12 noon on August 3, 1970, for a hearing and disposition of defendant's motion for new trial. The notification stated that if the time and place were not convenient to counsel the court would re-schedule the motion for a hearing at an earlier date.</div><div class="casepar">At the time and place for said hearing the court called the case, and no appearance was made by the defendant or his counsel. The State's counsel moved that the case be dismissed for want of prosecution. The court granted this motion and entered an order "overruling and dismissing the motion for new trial as amended for lack of prosecution."</div><div class="casepar">1. Did the trial court properly dismiss the motion for new trial when neither defendant nor his counsel appeared at the time and place set for hearing argument, and State's counsel moved for dismissal for want of prosecution? It appears beyond any question that the trial court was correct in granting the State's motion to dismiss. Defendant's brief contends his lawyer appeared about eight minutes later, and had been prevented from attending earlier for providential reasons, to wit: traffic congestion because of work on the highway between Washington and Atlanta, Ga. There was no motion made before the trial judge to reinstate the dismissed motion for such reason, and no mention of these facts is made in the transcript or record, it appearing only in the brief. But even if a motion to reinstate had been made, work on the highway could not be classified as "providential reason for delay." The motion for new trial had already been pending for approximately two years and nine months, and it was incumbent upon defendant or his counsel to appear at the time and place timely set for hearing, especially as the court's order instructed counsel to advise if this date was not convenient and he would reset it.</div><div class="casepar">If he had made a motion to reinstate, after his counsel reached the courtroom (which he did not do), and if he could have supported such motion by showing his delay was for providential reasons (which could not have been done in this instance), then this court could have dealt with that question. But in the present state of the record, no motion to reinstate was made, and this question is not before us. It follows that the enumeration of error complaining of the dismissal of the motion for new trial is not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">The affirmance of this ruling on the dismissal adverse to the appellant establishes each and every point or question therein raised in the motion for new trial as finally settled between the parties against the movant as the law of this case. The appellant had elected to further extend the proceedings in the lower court by staying the final judgment in filing the motion for new trial, instead of appealing directly from the rulings of the court. By suffering a dismissal of this appeal by motion in the lower court it became final against him when affirmed by this court.</div><div class="casepar">Thus the "law of the case" was established against defendant's contentions respecting each complaint made in his motion for new trial, as amended. The following Supreme Court cases are cited here due to their similarity to this issue, but not as absolute controlling authority. See Hill v. Willis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../146/57/index.html">224 Ga. 263 (4) (161 SE2d 281)</a></span>; Tiller v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/01/index.html">224 Ga. 645 (164 SE2d 137)</a></span>; Staggers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/88/index.html">224 Ga. 839 (165 SE2d 300)</a></span>; Styles v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/30/index.html">225 Ga. 731 (1) (171 SE2d 310)</a></span>. Whether or not the Georgia court of last resort will follow the above ruling is uncertain, but following the rule of stare decisis as set forth in cases too numerous to mention here, the dismissal of the motion for new trial resulted in a ruling against the appellant on the issues raised therein which, if unreversed, establishes the same against him. While our new appellate procedure attempts to track the Federal rules, the two are not completely identical, and we must wait years to completely settle all possible issues which can result or appear by this drastic change in our appellate practice procedure.</div><div class="casepar">2. Pretermitting the question of whether or not the dismissal of the motion for new trial when affirmed established the law of the case as to each and every complaint contained therein, we move on and consider the errors enumerated herein, even though the writer is of the opinion that the movant having suffered a judgment against him (in these questions, the affirmance of same has established the law of the case thereon affirmatively against him. We therefore consider now the main thrust of the appeal, that in, that the trial court erred in denying defendant's intentions for a continuance in the case.</div><div class="casepar">In this case a warrant was sworn out, and the defendant was released on bond before the August term, 1967, as to said criminal charge of forgery, which actually allowed defendant more than three months before the November term of court in which to prepare for trial. It is the defendant's duty to employ counsel to aid in the preparation of his defense in advance of the trial of the case. Hall v. State, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. App. 112</span> (1 b) (<span class="casemissing">95 SE 936</span>); Shivers v. State, <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. 149 (2)</span>. And see Roberts v. State, <span class="casemissing">32 Ga. App. 339 (123 SE 151)</span>; Duke v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/04/index.html">104 Ga. App. 494 (122 SE2d 127)</a></span>; Bradley v. Sherwin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../657/90/index.html">110 Ga. App. 632 (8) (139 SE2d 512)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">It has been held that where a party has had several months in which to employ counsel and neglects to do so, no continuance will be granted for such reason. Gunn v. Gunn, <span class="casemissing">95 Ga. 439 (1) (22 SE 552)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, where the defendant is out of jail and under bond, he should employ counsel to represent him. Hall v. State, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. App. 112 (1) (95 SE 936)</span>; Boyd v. State, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 84 (1) (10 SE2d 271)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Likewise, absence of counsel is not a favored ground of continuance. Poppell v. State, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. 276 (2)</span>; James v. State, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 76 (1) (102 SE 425)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">When the motion to continue was made, it is not clear as to the status of Attorney Leroy Johnson, respecting whether he still represented defendant and whether defendant still relied upon him. Defendant did say Attorney Johnson was representing him at the August term, 1967, and advised him his case was "thrown out of court," but said attorney was not further accounted for and we can only speculate as to whether defendant still relied upon him or not when his case was called at the November term, 1967.</div><div class="casepar">Where counsel is ill when employed, a continuance because of such illness will not be granted. Blackwell v. Jennings, <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 264 (1) (57 SE 484)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Here it was shown that defendant told the trial court on Monday morning that Attorney Hill did not represent him, but later in the week he did represent him but was ill, in New York. The only conclusion possible is that he was employed after Monday morning and the telegram concerning illness having failed to state the details concerning the illness, including its probable duration, it must be presumed that Attorney Hill was ill when employed.</div><div class="casepar">If counsel is ill on the day of trial, he is required to seek "a temporary postponement," and not a continuance for the term, unless a showing is made that he will be ill for a lengthy period. Wright v. State, <span class="casemissing">184 Ga. 62</span>, 65 (<span class="casemissing">190 SE 663</span>).</div><div class="casepar">In order to secure a continuance because of illness of counsel, the party making the application must swear that he cannot go safely to trial without the services of such absent counsel, and that he expects his services at the next term, and that said application is not made for delay only. See Code  81-1413. The application for continuance in this case, first of all, was not sworn to by the party; next, it was not shown that the services of the attorney were expected at the next term of court, and that the application was not made for delay only.</div><div class="casepar">There is an absolute requirement that the application must show on oath that the motion is "not made for delay." See Wall v. State, <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 86 (1) (54 SE 815)</span>; Burnett v. State, 87 Ga, 622 (1) (<span class="casemissing">13 SE 552</span>); McKenzie v. State, <span class="casemissing">72 Ga. App. 208</span>, 216 (<span class="casemissing">33 SE2d 539</span>).</div><div class="casepar">The motion to continue must show the services of absent counsel are expected at the next term. Wright v. State, <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. 383 (2)</span>; Wall v. State, <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 86 (1)</span>, supra; Smith, Son &amp; Bro. v. Printup Bros. &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. 610 (1)</span>; Lamar v. McDaniel, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. 547 (2) (3 SE 409)</span>; Butler v. Ga. Agricultural Credit Corp., <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. App. 390 (1) (140 SE 426)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Generally, granting or refusing a continuance is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, and unless abused, such discretion will not be controlled. Revel v. State, <span class="casemissing">26 Ga. 275 (2)</span>; Long v. State, <span class="casemissing">38 Ga. 491</span> (4, 5); Simmons v. State, <span class="casemissing">116 Ga. 583 (42 SE 779)</span>; Hardy v. State, <span class="casemissing">117 Ga. 40 (1) (43 SE 434)</span>; Turner v. State, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. 765</span>; Griffin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../193/56/index.html">208 Ga. 746 (69 SE2d 192)</a></span>; Crow v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../714/27/index.html">86 Ga. App. 11 (1) (70 SE2d 601)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">For all the foregoing reasons it is clear the lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions for continuance.</div><div class="casepar">3. It appears from the record that the accused has been represented by several lawyers of his own choice from the beginning of this case to the present. It is true that counsel who tried the case was not his leading counsel, to wit: Mr. Hill, who apparently was sick and unable to attend the trial. However, the changing of attorneys from Hill and Johnson to Thompson, and then to Hill (sick) and Jackson, was all of the accused's making, not the court's. There is no merit in any of the complaints that he was not afforded the benefit of counsel of his own choosing.</div><div class="casepar">4. Since the penalty for forging a deed (Code  26-3901) is from four to ten years, the charge of the penalty for forgery under Code  26-3914 of from two to five years was helpful rather than harmful to the accused, as a charge under Code  26-3901 might have resulted in a greater sentence. The complaints of error on the failure to charge the law as to forgery of a deed and in charging instead the lesser penalty under Code  26-3914 are not meritorious. Nor did a charge under Code  26-3914 render the indictment defective since it is not necessary that the forgery result in a perfect instrument. Allgood v. State, <span class="casemissing">87 Ga. 668 (13 SE 569)</span>. See also Berrisford v. State, <span class="casemissing">66 Ga. 53 (1)</span>; Chambers v. State, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. App. 748</span>, 751 (<span class="casemissing">97 SE 256</span>), and cases cited therein.</div><div class="casepar">5. The evidence here was sufficient to support the verdict of guilty, and none of the errors enumerated claiming the evidence was insufficient is meritorious. The error complaining of the rescinding and revoking of appellant's superseadeas bond is considered to be moot since the court here affirms the judgment.</div><div class="casepar">HALL, Presiding Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">The Georgia and United States Constitutions do not promise merely the facade of legal representation to one accused of a crime. The right 10 counsel is an empty privilege if it does not comprehend the right of counsel to prepare. "The defendant needs counsel and counsel needs time." Hawk v. Olson, 326 U. S. 271, 278 (66 SC 116, 90 LE 61).</div><div class="casepar">1. Defendant was indicted and arrested in August if 1967. He immediately employed counsel, his brother-in-law, M. G. Hill, and Leroy Johnson. Upon his release from jail, these lawyers told him that his case had been "thrown out." Three months later, while defendant was hospitalized in Atlanta, he learned through his wife that the sheriff had been to his house with a notice of arraignment. Defendant was released from the hospital on November 3 and tried to reach his lawyers. He discovered that Hill was in a hospital in New York and Johnson was out of town. He appeared alone at calendar call on November 6, but on November 7, the date set for trial, he appeared with an attorney, one Thompson, who requested a continuance on the ground of insufficient time to prepare. The court refused to grant a continuance but did set the case over to the next day when Thompson announced that he did not represent defendant. However, Attorney Maynard Jackson was in court and stated that lie was there at the request of chief counsel Hill for the sole purpose of making, on Hill's behalf, a motion for a continuance on the grounds that he was physically unable to be there and that he was specifically qualified to handle the case. Jackson further stated that he was absolutely unprepared to try the case. The court denied the motion and told Jackson he could have 30 minutes to prepare. The case came on for trial with Jackson acting as his counsel, and defendant was convicted.</div><div class="casepar">In my opinion these circumstances fall squarely within the rule set out by this court in a recent case with very similar facts: "the constitutional mandate of this State is clear . . . that every defendant charged with a crime in this State is entitled to be defended by counsel of his own selection whenever he is able and willing to employ one, and uses reasonable diligence to obtain his services, and that where this appears he should not be deprived of representation by the counsel which he chose, or forced to trial with the assistance of counsel appointed by the court . . . The trial court erred in refusing to delay the trial at least sufficiently to determine whether it could be held with representation by selected counsel and without undue delay." Long v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../628/90/index.html">119 Ga. App. 82</a></span>, 84 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../628/90/index.html">166 SE2d 365</a></span>). See also Smith v. Greek, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../140/43/index.html">226 Ga. 312 (175 SE2d 1)</a></span>; Fair v. Balkcom, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/97/index.html">216 Ga. 721 (119 SE2d 691)</a></span>; Bagwell v. State, <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. 406</span>; Dowda v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/12/index.html">119 Ga.

Where the question is one of weeks or days, the matter should in the main rest with the trial judge. In some rare circumstances, there may he an exercise of discretion even where the question is one of several hours. To say this discretion extends to a matter of minutes in a felony case is to reduce the right to prepared counsel to an absurdity.</div><div class="casepar">2. The majority opinion raises sua sponte the question of whether the trial court's ruling on the above question became the law of the case so as to eliminate defendant's right to prepared counsel by means of a procedural maze.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant's first enumeration of error is on the denial of his motion for continuance without any reference to the dismissal of his motion for new trial. Code Ann.  6-702 provides that a motion for a new trial need not be filed as a condition precedent to appeal, need not be transmitted as a part of the record on appeal (if the motion is made), and that it shall not be necessary that the overruling thereof be enumerated as error on appeal. Prior to Hill v. Willis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../146/57/index.html">224 Ga. 263 (161 SE2d 281)</a></span>, the Supreme Court decided three appeals from which the overruling of a motion for a new trial was not appealed, yet the court considered enumerations of error on the same questions which were raised in the motion for new trial. Worley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../153/42/index.html">222 Ga. 319 (149 SE2d 682)</a></span>; Roach v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/66/index.html">221 Ga. 783 (147 SE2d 299)</a></span>; Dickerson v. Harvey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/09/index.html">221 Ga. 606 (146 SE2d 310)</a></span>. See in this regard the dissenting opinion of Justice Mobley in Hill v. Willis, supra, p. 269.</div><div class="casepar">This procedure was modified in Hill v. Willis, supra. The Supreme Court, in a split decision, held that where a motion for new trial is overruled by the trial court, the judgment establishes the law of the case as to questions raised by the motion unless the judgment on this ruling is enumerated as error on appeal.</div><div class="casepar">The doctrine of the law of the case "is nothing more than a special and limited application of the doctrine of res judicata." 21 CJS 330, 331,  195, citing Williams Realty &amp;c. Co. v. Simmons, <span class="casemissing">188 Ga. 184 (8 SE2d 580)</span>; Simmons v. Williams Realty &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">185 Ga. 154 (194 SE 356)</span>. Both this court and the Supreme Court have consistently held that a dismissal is not "res judicata" or the "law of the case" so as to bar a subsequent ruling on the merits of a ground where the previous dismissal was not based upon the merits. Keith v. Darby, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/32/index.html">104 Ga. App. 624 (1) (122 SE2d 463)</a></span> and cases cited; O'Kelley v. Alexander, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../142/68/index.html">225 Ga. 32 (165 SE2d 648)</a></span>; Barber v. Dunn, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../140/38/index.html">226 Ga. 303 (174 SE2d 898)</a></span>; Bregman v. Rosenthal, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../178/96/index.html">212 Ga. 95 (1) (90 SE2d 561)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">It is clear therefore that the dismissal of a motion for new trial cannot be the law of the case as to the merits of the ground in the motion for new trial (that the trial court erred in denying a motion for continuance) so as to prevent this court from passing on a direct enumeration on this ground (denial of motion for continuance) from the final judgment.</div><div class="casepar">The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that Hill v. Willis, supra, should not be extended beyond its specific holding. Tiller v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/01/index.html">224 Ga. 645 (164 SE2d 137)</a></span>; Gainesville Stone Co. v. Parker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/84/index.html">224 Ga. 819 (165 SE2d 296)</a></span>; Staggers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../148/88/index.html">224 Ga. 839 (165 SE2d 300)</a></span>. It applies only where the motion for new trial has been overruled and there is no enumeration of error on this ruling.</div><div class="casepar">It should be remembered that we are not only dealing with the defendant's right of counsel under the Georgia Constitution but with the same right under the United States Constitution. The day is long past when state procedural devices can be created sua sponte to interfere with federally created rights. Brown v. Western R. of Alabama, 338 U. S. 294 (70 SC 105, 94 LE 100).</div><div class="casepar">In my opinion the defendant has been deprived of his most basic right in a criminal prosecution--the right to prepared counsel in the actual trial of the case.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Kenneth E.
