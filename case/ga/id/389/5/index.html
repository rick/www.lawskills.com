Before Judge Bell, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">We granted the appellant's discretionary application, and we affirm. The appellant, Jerome Ridley, and the appellee, Mae Grandison, a/k/a Mae Ridley, met in Virginia in 1976. Sometime in 1979, the appellant moved into the appellee's apartment with the appellee and her son, and they resided there together for approximately six years.</div><div class="casepar">In June 1985, the appellant moved to Macon and in December 1985, the appellant moved the appellee and her son to Macon. He claimed the moving expenses on his federal tax return; he claimed the appellee's son for federal and state income tax purposes; and filed taxes as head of household. Shortly after moving into their Macon home, the parties completed a credit application with a local furniture company. The application stated: "Whether or not married, you have the right to apply for credit separately from or jointly with your spouse or another person." The parties checked the box marked "married," and the appellee signed the application as "Mae Ridley." The parties obligated themselves for an amount in excess of five thousand dollars for the furniture they purchased with the approved credit application.</div><div class="casepar">In 1988 the appellee filed a complaint for divorce; one of the grounds was adultery. In her complaint she alleged that she and the appellant had a common law marriage. The jury found that a common law marriage existed and awarded the parties a divorce. There was a division of property and liabilities on the property and the appellee was awarded alimony for three years.</div><div class="casepar">After a hearing, the trial court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding and verdict and the appellant's motions for j.n.o.v. and new trial were denied.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence to support the jury's verdict in this case, and this Court will not disturb a verdict if there is any evidence to support the verdict. Horton v. Kitchens, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../443/1/index.html">259 Ga. 446 (383 SE2d 871) (1989)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">HUNT, Justice, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">In the absence of a positive legislative enactment declaring unlicensed, nonceremonial marriages to be void, common law marriages have been recognized in Georgia since at least 1860. Under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/3/1/index.html">19-3-1</a></span> the essential elements of a marriage, are (1) the parties must be able to contract, (2) there must be an actual contract, and (3) there must be consummation according to law. These three requirements must be met at one period in time in order to form a common law marriage. Brown v. Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">234 Ga. 300</a></span>, 301 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">215 SE2d 671</a></span>) (1975).</div><div class="casepar"> When the relationship between the parties begins as an illicit arrangement, the burden is on the party asserting the validity of the marriage to show that the illicit relationship ended and that the parties did actually enter a marriage contract. [Cit.] . . . "This may be done by . . . such circumstances as the act of living together as man and wife, holding themselves out to the world as such, and repute in the vicinity and among neighbors and visitors that they are such, and indeed all such facts as usually accompany the marriage relation and indicate the factum of marriage. The evidence in each case is for the jury." [Cit.]</div><div class="casepar">Id. at 302.</div><div class="casepar">1. The evidence in support of the existence of a marriage included (1) Grandison's testimony that "I consider myself as married to Mr. Jerome Ridley. . . . He helped me to see after my child and he did not leave"; and,</div><div class="casepar">Q: After you got to Georgia, did you and Jerome Ridley ever talk about getting married? A: No. I figured that we were already married. He brought me down here.</div><div class="casepar">(2) A witness testified:</div><div class="casepar">I knew personally what their relationship was. I knew that they had not been legally married but nonetheless I considered them married. . . . To me they were a couple.</div><div class="casepar">And (3) documentary evidence was presented, showing her signature as "Mae Ridley," on a credit card application, signed also by Ridley, that classified the parties as "married"; various bills and charge card tickets that identified Grandison as "Ms. Ridley," "Mae Ridley," or "Mrs. Ridley"; checks that Grandison wrote on Ridley's checking account signed by her in his name, and with his permission; and income tax returns on which Ridley claimed Grandison's child as his son, used a filing status as head of household, and claimed the expenses of moving Grandison and her son from Virginia to Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">2. Ridley offered as evidence the parties were not common law married that, in Virginia, each party filed separate income tax returns with Grandison filing as single and Ridley filing as head of household, while neither party ever filed a state or federal income tax return as married; the parties maintained Separate checking accounts in Virginia, while in Georgia, Ridley had the only checking account; the parties maintained individual charge accounts in their own names; Grandison completed job applications in Georgia listing herself as single; Ridley listed himself as single on several work-related papers; and neither party ever introduced the other as a spouse.</div><div class="casepar">3. The credit application mentioned above provides some evidence from which the jury could have found that Ridley and Grandison held themselves out as man and wife -- if not "to all the world," at least to a financial source. That evidence, however, is atomized by the following colloquy during the cross-examination of Grandison:</div><div class="casepar">Q: What name is on your driver's license?</div><div class="casepar">A: Mae Katherine Grandison.</div><div class="casepar">Q: And you list yourself as being single don't you?</div><div class="casepar">A: Yes I do.</div><div class="casepar">Q: Okay, and when you list yourself -- So we don't get it confused -- you understand that being single is not being married; is that your understanding?</div><div class="casepar">A: No.</div><div class="casepar">Q: In other words, if you're single, are you married? If you're married, are you single?</div><div class="casepar">A: You're getting the issue -- single for what purpose?</div><div class="casepar">Q: I mean I think either you're single or married. I don't think there's any halfway into it or halfway out of it. Which way is it?</div><div class="casepar">A: I am single. [Emphasis supplied.]</div><div class="casepar">Q: Okay, you're single? You have listed your other places -- Now, you've applied and you've worked at several places in Georgia and you've applied in several other places, have you not?</div><div class="casepar">A: Yes, I have.</div><div class="casepar">Q: Did you list yourself as single or as being married?</div><div class="casepar">A: As single. . . .</div><div class="casepar">Q: Do you ever recall a single incident when he introduced you and said to someone, "This is my wife?"</div><div class="casepar">A: No, I would say, no.</div><div class="casepar">A: No.</div><div class="casepar">Grandison's statement, "I am single," defeats her claim. That is, where both parties, as here, deny in court the existence of a marriage contract, characteristics of marriage such as those referred to in Division 1, cannot, by themselves, establish the existence of a marriage contract. I would hold that the trial court should have granted Ridley's motion for judgment n.o.v. and, therefore, must dissent.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Justice Weltner and Justice Fletcher join in this dissent.</div><div class="casepar">WELTNER, Justice, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">1. I join in Justice Hunt's dissent. Three of us concluded that the evidence demands a verdict for Ridley and entitles him to a judgment n.o.v. A majority of four has prevailed in holding that the jury's verdict must be upheld because there is some evidence to support it. The very nature of this dispute illustrates the reasons that I maintain that it is time for a re-examination of common law marriage.</div><div class="casepar">2. There can be no criticism of the reasons for the recognition, at the outset, of common law marriage. It is both a heritage from our frontier days, as well as a means of avoiding the disadvantages of "illegitimacy" that burden the child whose parents have foregone a ceremonial marriage. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> There is, however, substantial need for a new and critical inquiry as to whether prevailing principles of common law marriage serve the present age.</div><div class="casepar">3. This very case presents a strong argument for such a re-assessment, bearing in mind its uncertainties and delays, and the enormity of resources devoted to it. The complaint for divorce was filed in June of 1988. The parties spent three days in trial, calling seven witnesses, amassing a transcript of 439 pages, and entering into evidence seventeen exhibits -- largely to determine whether or not they were married! And at the dawn of the new year, 1990, that issue remained yet unresolved.</div><div class="casepar">4. The factual circumstances outlined in our recent case of Vaughn v. Vaughn, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../562/9/index.html">255 Ga. 76 (337 SE2d 763) (1985)</a></span>, offer further support:</div><div class="casepar">The parties were divorced. They continued to live together, ostensibly as husband and wife. After a period of time, the former husband underwent a ceremony of marriage with another woman, and the two of them now have a small child.</div><div class="casepar">Soon after that ceremony, Vaughn's first wife filed an action against him, alleging that the parties had become married "by the common law," and were then husband and wife, notwithstanding the earlier divorce. She sought alimony and other relief. The question of the alleged marriage was tried by a jury, which found in favor of the first wife.</div><div class="casepar">That finding, of course, had the effect of voiding the ceremonial marriage which Vaughn had undertaken, and imposing upon the child born to the parties all of the disadvantages of what the law terms "illegitimacy." [Id. at 76-7, dissent.]</div><div class="casepar">Thus, the very purpose of the initial recognition of common law marriage was defeated by the principles that we have developed to preserve it.</div><div class="casepar">Solution</div><div class="casepar">5. Plainly, the law of common law marriage is chaos that cries out for order. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> The materials found in the Appendix represent only eight years of turmoil, and only that disclosed at the appellate level. They reflect documentation of controversies that have been assembled subsequent to our case of Johnson v. Green, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/3/index.html">251 Ga. 645 (309 SE2d 362) (1983)</a></span>. In that case, which arose from circumstances similar to this case, the present writer suggested:</div><div class="casepar">If it be the policy of the law to foster marriage as an institution essential to the stability and health of the Republic, we ill-serve that goal by discounting the existence of this most important of all human relationships to a swearing match -- akin to the question of which driver had the green light; or, which of two brawlers struck the first blow; or, how long did the pain of whiplash endure.</div><div class="casepar">Finally, if marriage is a state "not to be undertaken lightly" (as observed at almost every wedding) it should not be too burdensome to require of parties who intend to commit their very lives to each other that they make plain to all the world such an intent by undergoing a ceremony of marriage. [Id. concurrence at 647.]</div><div class="casepar">6. In order to relieve the people and the courts of Georgia from much of the agony, whimsy and cost of disputed common law marriages, and to preserve those of its purposes that yet have merit, we could expand and extend the rule of Brown v. Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">234 Ga. 300</a></span>, 301 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">215 SE2d 671</a></span>) (1975). Specifically, we could adopt a new evidentiary requirement, as follows:</div><div class="casepar">The evidence necessary to prove the conversion of an illicit arrangement into a common law marriage must include (in addition to existing evidentiary requirements) either (1) proof of a bona fide attempt to contract a valid ceremonial marriage; or (2) the birth to the parties (after the commencement of an illicit arrangement) of a child or children.</div><div class="casepar">7. The enlargement of the rule would preserve these virtues:</div><div class="casepar">(a) no child of parents who have not contracted a valid ceremonial marriage would stand in any greater degree of being branded as "illegitimate" than was the case under formerly prevailing principles of common law marriage. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(c) The "frontier tradition" would be maintained. That is, a man and woman who are not in an illicit arrangement still may contract per verba de praesenti to declare themselves husband and wife, which, followed by "consummation according to law" (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/3/1/index.html">19-3-1</a></span>), will create a lawful marriage. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span></div><div class="casepar">8. The new rule would eliminate marriage by perjury and caprice. In doing so, it should lend order and stability to marriages undertaken with true intent and clear resolve.</div><div class="casepar">APPENDIX.</div><div class="casepar">Following our case of Johnson v. Green, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/3/index.html">251 Ga. 645 (309 SE2d 362) (1983)</a></span>, our court has been presented with seemingly infinite variations upon the theme of common law marriage. We discuss these here in order to demonstrate the chaos and confusion that pertain, of necessity, when the legal status of marriage wrapped as it is in emotion, and cloaked in a plethora of property rights -- is beclouded by so unruly a doctrine as that of common law marriage.</div><div class="casepar">Witness:</div><div class="casepar">(1) A man was convicted of the murder of a woman who had lived with him. One of his contentions on appeal (although this issue was not reached) was that he and the woman were married by the common law and her adulterous conduct should serve as serious provocation. Crosby v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../457/7/index.html">259 Ga. 822 (389 SE2d 207) (1990)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(2) As part of a divorce action, a woman claimed a house and land bought before they were married to be marital property because she asserted that she and her husband were married by the common law four years prior to their ceremonial marriage. Kuykendall v. Kuykendall, Case No. S90A0266, disposed of by order, February 16, 1990.</div><div class="casepar">(3) A man and woman married, were divorced, and later lived together for several months. A child was born, and subsequently the woman and child moved into the man's new home. The man claimed a common law marriage, filed for divorce, and sought custody of the child. Blanton v. Blanton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../451/4/index.html">259 Ga. 622 (385 SE2d 672) (1989)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(4) A man and woman married, produced a child, and separated. A second woman lived with the man and became pregnant. The man died in an airplane crash before completing divorce proceedings</div><div class="casepar">wedlock, without such license, yet, in the absence of any positive enactment, declaring that all marriages not celebrated in the prescribed form, shall be void; a marriage deliberately and intentionally entered into by the parties, who are able to contract according to the rules of the common law, without conforming to the enactment, is still a valid marriage. [Id. at 189.] against his wife. The wife applied to be administratrix of the intestate estate as surviving spouse. The second woman claimed to be the common law wife of the decedent and petitioned the court to remove the first woman as administratrix as next friend of the decedent's unborn child, who asserted a claim. Simpson v. King, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../441/8/index.html">259 Ga. 420 (383 SE2d 120) (1989)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(5) The parties cohabited and produced a child. The court found that there was no common law marriage. During a temporary hearing, the father stipulated in open court that he was the father and agreed to pay $40 a week child support. The trial court entered a final judgment as to child support and visitation, which was reversed as premature and the case remanded. Henderson v. Henderson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../468/8/index.html">258 Ga. 205 (367 SE2d 40) (1988)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(6) A man and woman lived together for nine years, acquiring property together while she received a widow's pension from her previous marriage. The man left and married someone else. A jury awarded the woman an equitable division of the mutual property. Henry v. Rice, 258 Ga. XXX (1988).</div><div class="casepar">(7) The parties married, were divorced, remarried others, were divorced from others, cohabited again, and separated again. A jury found a common law marriage and awarded the woman an automobile, $5000 lump sum alimony, and $800 per month periodic alimony. The judgment was affirmed on condition that a provision unauthorized by law (that the periodic alimony award survive the death of the husband and be payable from his estate) be stricken. Foskey v. Foskey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/3/index.html">257 Ga. 736 (363 SE2d 547) (1988)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(8) A woman was awarded temporary alimony based upon her assertion of a common law marriage. Ultimately the trial court denied her complaint for divorce, alimony, equitable division of property, and attorney fees upon proof of her incapacity to marry because of an undissolved ceremonial marriage to one man in 1964 and a subsequent undissolved common law marriage to a second man.

      For a discussion bearing the mark of nineteenth century mores and rhetoric, see Dillon v. Dillon, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. 204 (1878)</span>:For years and years, Mr. Dillon lived with Mrs. Dillon as his wife, recognizing and treating her as such. Of her, he begat children; and the parents and children were grouped as a family, and as such lived, openly, in the city of Savannah, the largest city of Georgia, and one of the most respectable cities of the world. if the marriage tie had been wanting, would this have occurred? Could it have occurred, in the midst of a moral and refined community, and under the eye of the police? The jury belonged to the vicinage, and could and did interpret the testimony in the light thrown upon it by the local gloss. They understood what such a mode of living in Savannah meant; whether it meant concubinage or matrimony. . . . Society, and each member of society -- the mass and the individual -- are benefited by closing the mouth of any man against repudiating his family when they come to him for needed support. if he may cast them off, they will, in many instances, fall a weighty burden on the public. To allow a husband to indulge in scruples about the pedigree of his old wife [he claimed she was of African descent and unable by law to marry him], when her youth, beauty and strength have all waned. and thus escape responding to her claim for reasonable alimony, would be unwise in policy, unsound in principle.

      Indeed, the first decision on common law marriage in this state, Askew v.
