Telfair Superior Court. Before Judge Lawson.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Mary Boney, the widow of Walter Boney, petitioned to probate the decedent's December 1979 will, in which she was named executor and sole beneficiary of the estate. Wimbric Boney, the decedent's adopted son, filed a caveat to the will, alleging that the will was the product of the decedent's monomania. The basis for this allegation stemmed from a November 1979 incident from which the testator had developed the insane delusion that he and the propounder had been insulted when the caveator's family had departed his home after refusing to eat food prepared by the propounder. A jury found in favor of Wimbric Boney and judgment was entered denying probate of the will. Mary Boney appeals from the judgment; Wimbric Boney cross-appeals, contingent upon reversal and remand for a new trial, from an evidentiary ruling made by the trial court. Because the evidence adduced did not authorize the jury to set aside the will for monomania, the trial court erred by denying the propounder's motion for a directed verdict and the judgment is reversed. The caveator's cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.</div><div class="casepar">1. Monomania is a mental disease which leaves the sufferer sane generally but insane on a particular subject or class of subjects. Johnson v. Dodgen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../861/8/index.html">244 Ga. 422 (1) (260 SE2d 332) (1979)</a></span>. "The very name 'monomania' implies partial insanity and excludes the idea of any sort of ratiocination as to the particular subject to which the partial insanity relates." Bohler v. Hicks, <span class="casemissing">120 Ga. 800</span>, 802-803 (<span class="casemissing">48 SE 306</span>) (1904). "[Monomania] is not the result of any conclusion; the person does not arrive at his conviction because of any attempt either at reasoning or investigation." Brumbelow v. Hopkins, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 247</span>, 249 (1) (<span class="casemissing">29 SE2d 42</span>) (1944).</div><div class="casepar">"The person so affected is subject to hallucinations and delusions, and is impressed with the reality of events which have never occurred and things which do not exist, and his actions are more or less in conformity with his belief in these particulars . . . [.] It is not every delusion which will deprive one of testamentary capacity. It must be an insane delusion. A definition of such a delusion which has been approved by this court is that it exists wherever a person conceives something extravagant to exist which has no existence whatever, and he is incapable of being permanently reasoned out of that conception. [Cit.] The subject-matter of the insane delusion must have no foundation in fact, and must spring from a diseased condition of mind. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">English v. Shivers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../161/98/index.html">219 Ga. 515</a></span>, 518-519 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../161/98/index.html">133 SE2d 867</a></span>) (1963). A showing of hallucinations or insane delusions is essential to proving monomania. Whitfield v. Pitts, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 259</span>, 272 (<span class="casemissing">53 SE2d 549</span>) (1949).</div><div class="casepar">Monomania is distinguished from ill will, bad judgment, animosity, prejudice, erroneous conclusions from facts, illogical views, and other conditions of mind which can be co-existent with sanity.

Hence, we have recognized that</div><div class="casepar">"[i]f the testator undertakes to make an investigation and arrives at the conclusion that a certain state of facts exists which in point of fact does not exist, such conclusion may be attributable either to a mistake in judgment or a mistake of fact, and will not be evidence of insanity . . . [.]"</div><div class="casepar">Hammett v. Reynolds, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../903/9/index.html">243 Ga. 669</a></span>, 671 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../903/9/index.html">256 SE2d 354</a></span>) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">(Punctuation omitted.) Brumbelow v. Hopkins, supra at 249.</div><div class="casepar">Applying these principles to the evidence adduced in the case at bar and construing that evidence most strongly in favor of the caveator, as the respondent on the motion for directed verdict, the evidence showed that the caveator was raised by the testator and his first wife, Cora Boney, who died in May 1974 after some 50 years of marriage. Three months later the testator married the propounder, his first cousin once removed and eight years his junior. Up until November 1979, the caveator, who lived with his family in the Atlanta area, frequently visited the testator, a Telfair County resident, and regularly attended the Boney Family reunions.</div><div class="casepar">In November 1979, the caveator, his wife, and two younger children drove from Atlanta to attend a reunion, but arrived too late to eat at the clubhouse where the first part of the reunion was held. They went to the testator's house where the propounder and the testator's sister had brought some food from the clubhouse to make available to the caveator and another late-arriving relative. Because the caveator's children were hungry, they sat down at the dining room table. It is uncontested, however, that the children did not eat because the caveator's wife decided to leave with the children to dine at another relative's house. The family had arrived and the wife and children had departed the testator's house within a 30-minute period.</div><div class="casepar">The jury was authorized to believe the caveator's evidence that his family's departure was not of an insulting nature and that his family routinely chose to eat elsewhere when visiting the testator. The jury was also authorized to believe the caveator's evidence that on the following day, when the caveator asked the testator about his cool manner during the reunion, the testator asserted angrily that the caveator's wife had departed the previous evening because she refused to eat food prepared by the propounder and that the testator considered it an insult to the propounder and himself. The caveator testified that his wife spoke to the testator and directly denied that she had refused to eat the food or insulted the propounder. The testator then cursed at the caveator's wife and threatened to slap her. None of the witnesses at trial, including life-long friends, had ever known the testator to have cursed or threatened a woman. When the caveator defended his wife, the testator ordered him and his family out of the house. It is uncontroverted that in the 12 years following this incident until the testator's death, the caveator and his family had only minimal contact with the testator.</div><div class="casepar">While the jury was authorized to find that the testator erroneously concluded that the departure was an insult, given the foundation in fact for the conclusion (food prepared by the propounder had been available; the caveator's wife and children did leave without eating), the testator's belief that the departure was an insult to the propounder was, at most, " 'the result of an erroneous conclusion based upon an illogical deduction drawn from facts as they really exist,'" <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> English v. Shivers, supra at 520, which does not constitute the insane delusion that is necessary for monomania. Under the facts presented in this case, the jury was not authorized to set aside the testator's will on the ground of monomania and thus the verdict cannot be sustained on this ground. Compare Powell v. Thigpen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../129/86/index.html">230 Ga. 760 (199 SE2d 251) (1973)</a></span> (although evidence adduced may have explained testator's extreme dislike for caveator, other evidence, such as testator's belief that caveator had "cast a spell" on him, was sufficient to raise question for jury as to monomania).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred by denying the propounder's motion for a directed verdict. See generally Hammett v. Reynolds, supra.</div><div class="casepar">2. Because the evidence demanded a verdict in favor of the propounder of the will, the case need not be remanded to the trial court for a new trial. Accordingly, the caveator's cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.</div><div class="casepar">CARLEY, Justice, concurring.</div><div class="casepar">Our holding that the trial court erred in denying the propounder's motion for directed verdict is dispositive of all issues raised in the appeal and in the caveator's cross-appeal. This is so because the only basis for the caveat was the alleged monomania of the testator. Except for the allegation of monomania, caveator admitted the testamentary capacity of the testator. Because our reversal of the denial of the directed verdict leaves nothing to be retried, we need not consider the propounder's additional enumeration of error complaining of the trial court's admission of evidence concerning an earlier will. Likewise our holding deprives the "defensive" cross-appeal of any viability. The caveator's cross-appeal asserted that in the event of the reversal of the judgment in his favor, this Court should determine that the admission of certain evidence was erroneous so that such evidence would be excluded on retrial. However,</div><div class="casepar">reversal by an appellate court of the trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict can mean only that a directed verdict should have been and should be entered. This is tantamount to a reversal with direction, and thus no retrial can be held on those issues.</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis in original.) Kirkland v. Southern Discount Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/11/index.html">187 Ga. App. 453</a></span>, 454 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/11/index.html">370 SE2d 640</a></span>) (1988). Thus, even if the trial court erred as alleged in the cross-appeal, it is not reviewable because the propounder is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law and, thus, there will be no new trial.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Justice Sears joins in this concurrence.</div><div class="casepar">Gandy, Rice &amp; Sundberg, L.
