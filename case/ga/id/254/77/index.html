Before Judge Motes.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Harold Hendrix, a/k/a Harold Hendricks, appeals his conviction of one count each of child molestation, cruelty to children, and aggravated sexual battery of his nine-year-old adopted daughter. Appellant enumerates eight errors. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. The trial court did not err in ruling that appellant's pre-arrest statement was non-custodial, voluntary, and admissible at trial. A female employee of the county DFACS investigated the child molestation allegations; appellant had been named as the alleged perpetrator by his daughter. The employee contacted appellant and requested that he come down to the local police station. Although the employee did not advise appellant of the specific allegations made against him, she did inform him who she was and that "there had been some allegations" made. Appellant immediately went to the police station of his own free will; no threats or promises were made to get him to do so. When he arrived, appellant was taken to a small interview room, without windows, located in the interior of the building. For reasons of privacy, the interview was not conducted in the lobby; the counsel room was not used as someone had been locking the counsel chamber doors. Appellant did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the interview. According to protocol, appellant was interviewed by the employee in the presence of a female police investigator. The officer was dressed in khaki pants with a button-down oxford shirt; although she had a badge, the officer was not carrying any weapon. Appellant was introduced to the DFACS employee and to the police investigator and then informed of the allegations made against him. At no time during the interview process was he informed of his right to counsel, of his right to remain silent, or told that anything he said could be used against him. Appellant was not placed under formal arrest, he was not in handcuffs and, although not so informed, he was free to leave the station at any time. Except for a few questions asked at the end of the interview by the police officer, the interview was conducted by the DFACS employee. Appellant responded voluntarily to questions regarding the allegations made against him, and the DFACS employee then set up a "safety plan," as she had done with the child's mother. Thereafter, appellant departed the station in the same manner in which he had arrived; he was not charged or detained at that time. Appellant was arrested the next day. Appellant testified that, at the police station, he did not feel that he was free to come and go if he wanted to, because he had never been in trouble before and did not know what rights he had or what to do.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court ruled appellant's pretrial statement could be admitted in evidence and held that appellant was free to leave the police station at any time, he was not in custody, the statement was not taken during a custodial interrogation, and his "statement was freely and voluntarily given without the slightest hope of benefit or remotest fear of injuries. . . . No promises were made to him."</div><div class="casepar">"[T]he issue presented, as to whether appellant was in custody for Miranda purposes, is a mixed question of law and fact. We will not reverse the trial court's fact findings which underpin its legal conclusion made at a suppression hearing, unless they are clearly erroneous." Whatley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/22/index.html">196 Ga. App. 73</a></span>, 78 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/22/index.html">395 SE2d 582</a></span>). A person is not in a state of custody merely because he is a prime suspect at the time he is interrogated by the police or their agent. See Vaughn v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../380/3/index.html">261 Ga. 686</a></span>, 687 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../380/3/index.html">410 SE2d 108</a></span>). Even if the police have probable cause to arrest at the time of the interview and secretly intend to charge the suspect at some future time, such facts are immaterial to a determination of whether the suspect was in custody at the time of the interview, except when and to what extent the police communicate their future intent to arrest during the course of the interview. State v. Brannan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/77/index.html">222 Ga. App. 372</a></span>, 376 (2) (c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/77/index.html">474 SE2d 267</a></span>). " 'Miranda warnings are not required simply because questioning takes place in a building containing jail cells.' " Id. at 375. A suspect must be in a custodial situation for Miranda to apply; a suspect is not entitled to Miranda warnings, as a matter of right, unless he has been taken into custody or has been deprived of freedom of action in another significant way. Hardeman v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../640/4/index.html">252 Ga. 286</a></span>, 288 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../640/4/index.html">313 SE2d 95</a></span>); Carroll v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/80/index.html">208 Ga. App. 316</a></span>, 317 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/80/index.html">430 SE2d 649</a></span>). The cases cited by appellant in support of this enumeration of errors are distinguishable. The real issue for adjudication "is whether the individual was formally arrested or restrained to the degree associated with a formal arrest." Hodges v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../9/index.html">265 Ga. 870</a></span>, 872 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../9/index.html">463 SE2d 16</a></span>). In resolving this issue, the "relevant inquiry is how [a] reasonable person in suspect's position would perceive his situation" (Hodges, supra, citing Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 442 (104 SC 3138, 82 LE2d 317)); that is, "whether 'a reasonable person in [appellant's] position would have understood the situation to constitute restraint on freedom of movement of the degree which the law associates with formal arrest.' " Manchester v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/99/index.html">226 Ga. App. 653</a></span>, 655 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/99/index.html">487 SE2d 449</a></span>). Applying these standards to the evidence before us, we conclude the trial court's finding that the appellant's statement was voluntarily made under noncustodial circumstances was not clearly erroneous. Compare Hodges, supra; Vaughn, supra; Manchester, supra.</div><div class="casepar">2. Jury instructions must be read and considered as a whole in determining whether a charge contained error. Hambrick v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../554/6/index.html">256 Ga. 688</a></span>, 690 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../554/6/index.html">353 SE2d 177</a></span>). Absent a remedial instruction, reversible error can occur if a jury charge recites the entire statutory definition of a crime, thereby informing the jury that a crime may be committed in more than one manner, when the indictment avers that the crime was committed only in one specific way. Dukes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../237/7/index.html">265 Ga. 422</a></span>, 423 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../237/7/index.html">457 SE2d 556</a></span>) (court failed to give a remedial instruction limiting jury's consideration to the manner in whiCh the offense was averred to have been committed in the indictment); but compare Green v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../279/16/index.html">221 Ga. App. 694 (2) (472 SE2d 457)</a></span>. In this instance, the trial court did not err in charging the entire language of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/70/index.html">16-5-70</a></span> (b), pertaining to the offense of cruelty to children, as the jury was also given an instruction which confined the elements of the crimes charged to those "material allegation[s] in the indictment." McClain v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../280/97/index.html">220 Ga. App. 474</a></span>, 475 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../280/97/index.html">469 SE2d 756</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">This holding is consistent with the previous recognition of appellate courts that "[b]ecause children do not have the capacity to give consent to or resist a sexual act directed at them, such acts 'are, in law, forcible and against the will' of a child." (Emphasis supplied.) Brown v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../147/6/index.html">268 Ga. 154</a></span>, 155 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../147/6/index.html">486 SE2d 178</a></span>); Richardson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../556/6/index.html">256 Ga. 746</a></span>, 747 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../556/6/index.html">353 SE2d 342</a></span>). Cf. Daniel v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../365/33/index.html">194 Ga. App. 495</a></span>, 497-498 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../365/33/index.html">391 SE2d 128</a></span>) (modern sexually transmitted disease creates new dimension to legal question of intelligent and informed consent to a sexual act by a child).</div><div class="casepar">4. It constitutes an act of aggravated sexual battery for a person to penetrate intentionally and without consent the sexual organ of another with his finger or other foreign object. Burke v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../317/11/index.html">208 Ga. App. 446 (1) (430 SE2d 816)</a></span>; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/6/22.2/index.html">16-6-22.2</a></span>. We find penetration however slight will suffice to satisfy the statutory penetration element of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/6/22.2/index.html">16-6-22.2</a></span>; penetration may be proved by indirect or circumstantial evidence. Cf. Ortiz v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../275/01/index.html">222 Ga. App. 432 (1) (474 SE2d 300)</a></span> (only slight penetration required for rape). The trial court did not err in charging the jury that "penetration of the child's sex organ need only be slight."</div><div class="casepar">5. The testimony of the child victim, the adults to whom the child made statements about appellant's conduct, and the statement which appellant made to the DFACS employee in the presence of a police investigator established facts from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of the offenses of which he was convicted. On appeal the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to support the verdict, and appellant no longer enjoys a presumption of innocence; moreover, an appellate court determines evidence sufficiency and does not weigh the evidence or determine witness credibility. Grant v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../361/20/index.html">195 Ga. App. 463</a></span>, 464 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../361/20/index.html">393 SE2d 737</a></span>). Review of the transcript reveals ample evidence from which any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of the offenses of child molestation, cruelty to children, and aggravated sexual battery of which he was found guilty. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560).</div><div class="casepar">Timothy G. Madison, District Attorney, Robin R.
