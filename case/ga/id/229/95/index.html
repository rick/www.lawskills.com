Carroll Superior Court. Before Judge Lee.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On August 11, 1998, Lawrence Shadix and the Carroll County Association of Taxpayers brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to stop Carroll County and the State Revenue Commissioner, Jerry Jackson, from collecting a special purpose local option sales tax ("SPLOST"). The court denied the injunctive relief, found in favor of the defendants, and Shadix and the plaintiffs appealed. For the following reasons, we conclude that the court erred, and we reverse.</div><div class="casepar">On July 13, 1993, the Carroll County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution calling for submission to the voters for approval of a referendum for the imposition of a special purpose county sales and use tax. See Ga. L. 1992, pp. 2998, 3005; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/111/index.html">48-8-111</a></span>. The specified purposes for which the proceeds were to be used included funding road, street, and bridge projects, as well as funding fire protection, recreation, water, sewer, and jail projects. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Under the authority of the resolution, the Chairman placed the referendum as to whether to impose a one percent SPLOST on the November 2, 1993 ballot. The language on the referendum ballot strictly conformed with the statutorily prescribed form. See Ga. L. 1992, p. 3003,  1 (d) (3). The ballot read:</div><div class="casepar">SPECIAL ELECTION 1 PERCENT SALES AND USE TAX REFERENDUM[.] A YES vote means you favor a 1 percent sales and use tax[.] A NO vote means you oppose a 1 percent sales and use tax[.] Shall a special 1 percent sales and use tax be imposed in Carroll County for the raising of not more than $34,000,000 for a period of time not to exceed four (4) years, for paving, resurfacing, traffic control and improvement to the system of Roads, Streets and Bridges within the county; and for a period of time not to exceed five (5) years for the purpose of funding capital improvements relating to fire protection services, recreational facilities, public buildings and water and sewerage projects within the county and its respective municipalities? ( ) YES ( ) NO</div><div class="casepar">On November 2, 1993, the referendum was held and more than one-half of the votes cast were in favor of imposing the SPLOST. The State Revenue Department confirmed receipt of the referendum results to impose the SPLOST and notified the Carroll County Board of Commissioners that the tax would be effective on April 1, 1994.</div><div class="casepar">As of May 21, 1998, $34,009,170.16 had been collected by the State Revenue Commissioner pursuant to the SPLOST. Through the June 1998 distribution, the Commissioner distributed revenues pursuant to the SPLOST to Carroll County in the amount of $34,285,209.62. In August 1998, Shadix, a resident of Carroll County, and a taxpayers group from Carroll County filed the complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, asserting that the SPLOST terminated when $34 million was raised. The State Revenue Commissioner, the Carroll County Tax Commissioner, Jean Matthews, and Carroll County filed answers and then briefs, claiming that the five-year period specified in the ballot was controlling for collection of the tax and that the tax collection should continue for five years, regardless of the amount of money raised.</div><div class="casepar">The parties and the trial court agreed to resolve the case on an expedited basis with stipulated facts and affidavits and to hold an accelerated final hearing on the merits on September 1, 1998. Before the hearing, the trial court held a conference during which plaintiffs' counsel announced that he was filing an amendment to the complaint to add Counts 4, 5, and 6; plaintiffs' counsel told the court that the amendment did not change plaintiffs' theory of the case. Plaintiffs also sought additional discovery from the defendants. The court directed the defendants to provide the key factual information needed by the plaintiffs in lieu of formal discovery. The trial court heard the merits of the case from all parties. At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties completed and filed their stipulations.</div><div class="casepar">On September 4, 1998, the court rendered final judgment, finding that the SPLOST terminated at the end of the day on March 31, 1999, and that the other issues in the amended Counts 4, 5, and 6 were either moot, without merit as a matter of law, or did not otherwise warrant judicial relief. Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court denied an emergency motion for escrow of such taxes pending appeal. After docketing, the Supreme Court transferred the appeal to this Court.</div><div class="casepar">1. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in denying injunctive relief to stop the continued collection of the SPLOST and in deciding the declaratory judgment adversely to them. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">We first examine the issue of mootness with respect to the questions raised regarding the termination of the tax. It is established that</div><div class="casepar">[a] petition for declaratory judgment will not lie where all rights of the parties have already accrued and where no facts or circumstances are alleged showing a necessity for adjudication in order to relieve the plaintiff from the risk of taking future undirected action, which, without such action, would jeopardize the plaintiff's interest.</div><div class="casepar">(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Kelly v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../288/85/index.html">217 Ga. App. 365</a></span>, 367 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../288/85/index.html">457 SE2d 675</a></span>) (1995), overruled on other grounds, Atlanta Independent School System v. Lane, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../216/2/index.html">266 Ga. 657 (1) (469 SE2d 22) (1996)</a></span>. Moreover, "as a general rule, a suit for injunctive relief regarding the collection of allegedly illegal taxes should not be entertained by the courts if the taxes at issue have been substantially collected and disbursed." 217 Ga. App. at 367 (2). Nevertheless, due process requires that redress be available when taxes have been collected unlawfully. See, e.g., Reich v. Collins, 513 U. S. 106 (115 SC 547, 130 LE2d 454) (1994); OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/2/35/index.html">48-2-35</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, it is not clear whether the substantive issues regarding the injunctive and declaratory relief which plaintiffs sought in the original complaint have become moot. The trial court's order stated that the tax would end on March 31, 1999. Although a consent order in the case was entered during the pendency of the case which stated that Carroll County "until further order of the Court" would not "spend any amount in excess of $34 million from the money raised by the special 1 percent sales and use tax," no such staying order was entered after the Court's final judgment. Moreover, as stated above, the parties filed an emergency motion for escrow of such taxes pending appeal, which the Supreme Court denied. In their stipulated facts, the parties agreed that "as of September 1, 1998, $36,183,787.99 had been collected by the State Revenue Commissioner pursuant to the Tax." The stipulation further provided that as of that date "Carroll County had received $35,821,950.11 from the money collected by the State Revenue Commissioner pursuant to the Tax." It is not clear from the record whether the additional money raised by the tax has been disbursed to the county, nor is it clear whether the county has spent the additional revenue. Moreover, there are issues to be resolved in this appeal which are dependent on our resolution of the merits of the underlying action. As discussed below, the trial court's determination regarding the termination of the tax was improper. Upon remand, the court should make a factual finding as to whether the collected taxes have been spent and, if so, should direct the parties accordingly.</div><div class="casepar">The General Assembly has enacted a detailed Code Article authorizing counties to impose a special one percent sales and use tax. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/110/index.html">48-8-110</a></span> et seq. Subject to the requirement of referendum approval and other requirements, the governing authority of any county may impose such a tax, for limited periods of time, for one or more statutorily authorized purposes. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/110/index.html">48-8-110</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/111/index.html">48-8-111</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The dispute in this case arose because of ambiguity in the applicable statute. The statutory scheme left a "gap" with respect to the termination date for a mixed use SPLOST. Under the version of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/112/index.html">48-8-112</a></span> (b) in effect before April 14, 1997, a SPLOST that was solely for purposes other than roads, streets, and bridges (a "non-road" tax) and that did not require a debt validation terminated: (i) at the end of the calendar quarter in which it was determined the specified maximum amount of the revenue was raised; or (ii) on the final day of the five-year maximum period of time, whichever came earlier.</div><div class="casepar">Nevertheless, the statute was unclear with respect to a mixed purpose SPLOST -- in other words, a tax to be used for both "non-road" and road purposes like the tax involved here. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/112/index.html">48-8-112</a></span> (b) (3), which terminated the tax when the specified maximum amount of revenue was received, purported to apply only to a non-road tax. Subsection (b) (2), which was not limited to non-road taxes, set the limitation solely on the basis of the specified period of time.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/121/index.html">48-8-121</a></span> (a) (3) provided that proceeds of a mixed purpose tax could be collected and used for both road and non-road purposes for the entire five years, so long as the total expenditures were consistent with that provided in the original resolution. Again, this section implied that the tax would terminate when the specified maximum amount was collected.</div><div class="casepar">In 1997 the General Assembly amended OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/112/index.html">48-8-112</a></span> (b) (3) specifically to apply to all SPLOST taxes, including mixed purpose taxes. Under the revised statute all SPLOST taxes clearly terminate when the maximum amount is raised. Ga. L. 1997, p. 519,  1. This change pertained only to resolutions adopted on or after April 14, 1997, and does not resolve the question raised in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The maximum amount of proceeds to be raised from the tax was a fundamental part of the tax referendum on which the Carroll County taxpayers voted. The language of the tax referendum provided that the tax would raise no more than $34 million over a period of no more than four years for purposes related to roads, streets and bridges, and for a period of no more than five years for the purpose of funding certain capital improvements. Stated differently, the voters approved a tax which would end within four and five years, or upon the collection of $34 million dollars. In so voting, the taxpayers approved only a limited collection of money.</div><div class="casepar">Our conclusion that the county was bound to terminate the tax when the maximum amount stated in the ballot was raised is bolstered by the general principle that when a revenue statute lacks clarity, it must be construed against the taxing authority. "[I]f a statute levying taxes is not clear and positive as to its terms, or if it is open to various interpretations through indefiniteness of its provisions, it is to be construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the citizen." Thompson v. Ga. Power Co., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 587</span>, 597 (<span class="casemissing">37 SE2d 622</span>) (1946); see also Fulton Metal Bed Mfg. Co. v. State Revenue Comm., <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 159</span>, 161 (2) (<span class="casemissing">182 SE 803</span>) (1935). The meaning of a revenue statute cannot be extended by implication. Novak v. Redwine, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../709/15/index.html">89 Ga. App. 755</a></span>, 757 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../709/15/index.html">81 SE2d 222</a></span>) (1954).</div><div class="casepar">Through the mechanism of the SPLOST, the General Assembly allowed its sovereign power to tax and collect to be employed by a county so that it could collect a special, consented-to tax for constitutionally permitted purposes. See generally City Council of Augusta v. Mangelly, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../892/9/index.html">243 Ga. 358</a></span>, 362 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../892/9/index.html">254 SE2d 315</a></span>) (1979). The Carroll County voters consented to the collection of no more than $34 million for the designated purposes. The voters did not consent to the collec-</div><div class="casepar">tion of additional money, and accordingly, the court erred in denying injunctive relief because the county was obligated to cease its taxation when this limitation was reached. See generally Dickey v. Storey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/9/index.html">262 Ga. 452</a></span>, 456 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/9/index.html">423 SE2d 650</a></span>) (1992) (Board of Commissioners was not authorized to use proceeds from the SPLOST tax for a purpose entirely different from that contained in original resolution). Based on our conclusion, we will not address plaintiffs' constitutional arguments in this regard.</div><div class="casepar">2. Plaintiffs contend that the court's grant of summary judgment on Counts 4, 5, and 6 of their amended complaint was improper. They also argue that the court erroneously disallowed discovery on these counts. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In Count 4, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to halt the expenditure of money raised after April 1, 1998, on roads. Count 5 sought injunctive relief for the ongoing improper spending of the excess proceeds of the tax in violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/121/index.html">48-8-121</a></span> (g) (2). Count 6 sought relief for the county's breach of statutory record-keeping requirements. In its order, the trial court concluded that because of its conclusion that the time period was controlling as to the limitation of the tax, the counts of plaintiffs' amended complaint were moot or without merit.</div><div class="casepar">As stated above, we cannot determine whether the county has spent the money raised by the tax or not. If the money has not been disbursed, then Count 4 can be properly dealt with by the court, given our conclusion in Division 1. Similarly, in light of our conclusion in Division 1, the court should have allowed Count 5 of the amended complaint.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court should also have allowed plaintiffs to amend by adding Count 6, regarding the maintenance of records. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/121/index.html">48-8-121</a></span> (a) (1) provides in pertinent part:</div><div class="casepar">The proceeds received from the tax authorized by this article shall be used by the county exclusively for the purpose or purposes specified in the resolution or ordinance calling for imposition of the tax. Such proceeds shall be kept in a separate account from other funds of the county and shall not in any manner be commingled with other funds of the county prior to the expenditure.</div><div class="casepar">Similarly, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/121/index.html">48-8-121</a></span> (a) (2) imposes strict record keeping, scheduling, and auditing practices to account for all expenditures.</div><div class="casepar">The County unlawfully collected the tax revenue that exceeded the $34 million cap and could not lawfully expend those funds. The court erred in not allowing plaintiffs to raise Count 6 regarding the County's maintenance of proper records. Although the County claims that it kept the requisite records, the court made no factual determination as to the correctness or adequacy of these records. Accordingly, on remand, the court should allow discovery so that a factual determination can be made as to whether the County kept the proper records, whether it properly disbursed the proceeds, and whether any excess proceeds were improperly expended. See Dickey v. Storey, 262 Ga. at 456 (3) (county must maintain financial records for each project for which tax proceeds are used).</div><div class="casepar">ELDRIDGE, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent.</div><div class="casepar">1. The trial court, on an undisputed evidentiary record by agreement of the parties, tried all of the issues in the case on the merits and entered a final declaratory judgment on the merits, which was adverse to the plaintiffs. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/65/index.html">9-11-65</a></span> (a) (2). Having decided the issues adversely to the plaintiffs as a matter of law, injunctive relief in equity was not appropriate. The legal questions were simple: (1) did the ballot language of the referendum determine when the SPLOST terminated or (2) did the statute authorizing the SPLOST provide the termination date?</div><div class="casepar">Carroll County, through the State Revenue Commissioner, can collect a SPLOST or any other tax authorized by the Georgia Constitution or by law authorized under the Constitution. "A County can only exercise the power of taxation as conferred upon it either directly by the Constitution or by the General Assembly when authorized by the Constitution."

McLennan v. Aldredge, supra at 882. Such referendum vote by a majority of the electorate to the imposition of a SPLOST is the exercise of a condition precedent to impose a tax authorized by the constitution and by the General Assembly conditioned upon such prior consent, which can be conferred at any time.

The power to tax comes not from the referendum, but from the General Assembly by statute authorized by the constitution. Id. Therefore, the electorate can either agree or disagree to be taxed under the terms and conditions of the statutory authority, not the ballot.

Thus, in passing the enabling legislation to create a SPLOST, the General Assembly expressed the clear intent to set the termination date by the statute and not by the language of the referendum ballot.

When read in pari materia with Ga.

In contrast, where the purpose did not include a combination of roads, streets, and bridges and other purposes, i.e., "mixed purpose," the termination date was "as of the end of the calendar quarter during which the commissioner determines that the tax will have raised revenues sufficient to provide to the county net proceeds equal to or greater than the amount specified as the maximum cost of the project." Ga. L. 1985, pp. 232, 238,  1 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/112/index.html">48-8-112</a></span> (b) (3)). Clearly and unambiguously, the statutes provided that a combined or mixed purpose SPLOST terminated based upon time and not based upon maximum tax receipts. Such termination provisions were clear and unambiguous whether for a single or mixed use purpose contrary to the majority's position; there was no "gap' for mixed use SPLOST. See Ga. L. 1985, pp. 232, 238,  1; Ga. L. 1992, pp. 2998, 3001,  1.</div><div class="casepar">However, Ga.

Further, in  2 of that 1997 amendment, the General Assembly limited such provision to prospective application only;</div><div class="casepar">[n]otwithstanding any provision of Code Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/1/3/4.1/index.html">1-3-4.1</a></span> to the contrary, this Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval and shall apply with respect to taxes imposed or to be imposed under resolutions or ordinances adopted on or after said effective date.</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis supplied.) Ga. L. 1997, pp. 519, 520,  2. Therefore, such amendment does not retroactively apply to the Carroll County SPLOST. In fact, the necessity of passing such amendment, which would bring about the result that plaintiffs urge if applied retrospectively, indicates that the General Assembly believed that the prior statutory provisions, rather than the formula prescribed by the ballot, determined the date of termination.</div><div class="casepar">Further, former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/8/112/index.html">48-8-112</a></span> (b) (2) provided that the tax would terminate "[o]n the final day of the maximum period of time specified for the imposition of the tax," which was five years.
