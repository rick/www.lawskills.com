Dougherty Superior Court. Before Judge Phipps.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Jan D. Crosby, as the widow of Bobby Ira Crosby, as the administratrix of his estate, as the mother and next friend of Kelly L. Crosby, a minor, and as an individual on her own behalf, sued Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company ("Cooper Tire") for negligent design, negligent manufacture, failure to warn, violation of the implied warranty of merchantability, and strict product liability for a defective consumer product, the left rear tire, which allegedly blew out and allegedly caused the family Ford Bronco II to roll over. On November 10, 1997, the case went to trial before a jury. On November 19, 1997, the jury returned verdicts in favor of Cooper Tire and against Mrs. Crosby.</div><div class="casepar">On June 16, 1991, Bobby Crosby drove the Bronco 70 miles to his parents' home. Suddenly a loud popping sound, like a shotgun, occurred. Mr. Crosby seemed to lose control of the Bronco. The vehicle jerked to the right, turned sideways, and flipped over. Immediately prior to Mr. Crosby's loss of control of the Bronco, the testimony was that the rubber exterior of the left rear tire tore open with an explosive, shotgun-like sound. The left rear tire had allegedly blown out. Mr. Crosby was killed, and Mrs. Crosby and Kelly were seriously injured.</div><div class="casepar">Less than a month prior to the rollover, Mrs. Crosby experienced shimmying or shaking in the Bronco. She took the vehicle in for service. The right rear tire was replaced as a result of failure, and the remaining tires were rotated and balanced, including the tire placed on the left rear. The shaking problem stopped. Mrs. Crosby thought that the shaking of the vehicle was caused by problems of tire balance, need for rotation, or misalignment. On Friday, June 14, 1991, Mrs. Crosby drove the Bronco and noticed the vehicle was again shaking. The Crosbys believed that the shaking again was caused by misalignment of the tires.</div><div class="casepar">The tire that allegedly blew out was an Atlas A/W radial manufactured by Cooper Tire. In 1990, Cecil Bowen sold this tire as a part of a set of four to Mr. Crosby. Shortly after the purchase of the set, one of the tires had to be replaced, because the tire had a knot or separation, which was observable only when the vehicle was on the grease rack.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A99A1980</div><div class="casepar">1. Mrs. Crosby's first enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to disregard her expert's testimony as to how the tire failure began and progressed. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">At trial, Mrs. Crosby's expert witness testified on direct examination, without objection, that a split in the inner liner of the tire occurred after the radial belts in the tire separated. The location of the split corroborated his opinion that the separation in the tire belts was due to a manufacturing defect which caused the split and that the split did not cause the belt separation from rollover impact. The expert went on to testify without objection that, immediately prior to the rollover, a "rapid air out" occurred from a burst bubble in the tire and that this air loss occurred in only one to two seconds. Rapid deflation in the left rear tire caused the tire to become softer and allowed the tire to steer to the right and have greater compliance so that the vehicle physically shifted farther in a turn and oversteered to the right, affecting the stability of the vehicle. when the tire deflated, this shift caused the driver to believe that the vehicle had changed direction, and the driver reacted by a steering change, causing a rollover.</div><div class="casepar">At the end of the direct examination of this expert, the trial court took a recess. At that time, Cooper Tire raised objections that this expert witness testified to opinions not previously divulged either in two depositions or in answers to interrogatories regarding the two-second tire deflation and the reason why the impact did not cause the radial belt separation. Cooper Tire moved for the trial court to strike such testimony and to instruct the jury to disregard such opinion testimony. The trial court granted the motion to strike and instructed the jury to disregard that portion of plaintiff's expert's opinion.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Cooper Tire failed to make its objections to the admission of plaintiff's expert's testimony contemporaneously with the allegedly objectionable testimony and thereby waived such grounds to object. See Goodtitle v. Roe, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. 135</span>, 140 (4) (1856); Burtine v. State of Ga., <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. 534</span>, 537 (1) (1855); Nashville, Chattanooga &amp;c. R. v. Ham, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 403</span>, 408 (1) (<span class="casemissing">50 SE2d 831</span>) (1948).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, Cooper Tire moved to strike testimony as a discovery abuse sanction after the testimony had been given without objection and at the completion of the direct examination of the expert witness. The trial court erroneously granted such motion, striking the evidence and instructing the jury accordingly. Like any other objection, a motion to strike must be made contemporaneously with the objectionable testimony, or a waiver occurs. See Sharpe v. Dept. of Transp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../179/8/index.html">267 Ga. 267</a></span>, 270-271 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../179/8/index.html">476 SE2d 722</a></span>) (1996); see also Dept. of Transp. v. Wallace Enterprises, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../242/59/index.html">234 Ga. App. 1</a></span>, 4 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../242/59/index.html">505 SE2d 549</a></span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Exclusion of relevant and material evidence from trial is an inappropriate remedy for curing a discovery omission or abuse. The appropriate remedies for discovery abuse are (1) postponement of trial or recess of trial in progress, pending action to procure rebuttal evidence, or (2) a mistrial, if there is no practical opportunity to make discovery and to obtain rebuttal evidence. White v. Lance H. Herndon, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/69/index.html">203 Ga.

App. 630</a></span>, 641 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../649/72/index.html">149 SE2d 383</a></span>) (1966).</div><div class="casepar">Such abuse of the trial court's discretion in excluding this expert's testimony as to a manufacturing defect and causation is harmful error requiring reversal and remand for retrial.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court simply did not have authority or latitude to grant [Cooper Tire's] motion to strike [Crosby's] expert's [new] testimony. The trial court's judgment must therefore be reversed for a new trial so that a jury may consider [Crosby's expert's] testimony.</div><div class="casepar">Hunter v. Nissan Motor Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/59/index.html">229 Ga. App. 729</a></span>, 730 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/59/index.html">494 SE2d 751</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">Since the other enumerations of error raised in the instant appeal and cross-appeal are likely to again arise on retrial, this court will also address them. Further, many of the issues are based upon the sound exercise of the trial court's discretion, which may change upon retrial before another trial judge. See Davis v. Glaze, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/62/index.html">182 Ga. App. 18</a></span>, 21 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/62/index.html">354 SE2d 845</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">2. Crosby contends that the trial court erred in excluding Cooper Tire's admissions as to what types of tire failures are caused by manufacturing defects. We agree in part.</div><div class="casepar">Cooper Tire's adjustment records are not hearsay but were admissions against interest of a corporation made through its agents and produced by such corporation through discovery. See Gorlin v. Halpern, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/39/index.html">184 Ga. App. 10</a></span>, 15 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/39/index.html">360 SE2d 729</a></span>) (1987), rev'd on other grounds, Burgess v. Gorlin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../465/1/index.html">258 Ga. 127 (365 SE2d 405) (1988)</a></span>. An admission against interest by a party is original evidence and is admissible as evidence as to the issue of liability. Cannon v. Rithmire, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../504/90/index.html">156 Ga. App. 360</a></span>, 361-362 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../504/90/index.html">274 SE2d 746</a></span>) (1980).</div><div class="casepar">(a) Since there was a material issue of fact as to whether the radial belting separated because of a manufacturing defect or impact in a tire with 30,000 to 40,000 miles of wear, the documents from Cooper Tire's adjustment process in general were relevant and material to show as to all tires, as a matter of causation, the difference between customer fault, i.e., service abuse such as impact damage, under- or over-inflation, or road hazard damage, or a manufacturing defect, i.e., a problem with workmanship and materials, and the frequency of such manufacturing defects occurring after 30,000 to 40,000 miles of use. Limiting instructions must be given to the jury.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Further, such adjustment documents were relevant, material, and admissible to demonstrate that the same model tires with prior or subsequent serial numbers from the same manufacturing plant had substantially similar manufacturing defects in either workmanship or materials or that such model tire had whatever incidence of manufacturing defects as compared with overall production of such tire. Browning v. Paccar, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../298/74/index.html">214 Ga. App. 496</a></span>, 498 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../298/74/index.html">448 SE2d 260</a></span>) (1994); Carsten v. Wilkes Supermarket &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../412/17/index.html">181 Ga. App. 834 (1) (353 SE2d 922) (1987)</a></span>; Gunthorpe v. Daniels, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../526/38/index.html">150 Ga. App. 113 (1) (257 SE2d 199) (1979)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Prior similar manufacturing defects would also be admissible to show defects, notice, prior knowledge and causation and for purposes of punitive damages. See Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 544 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">436 SE2d 635</a></span>) (1993); Skil Corp. v. Lugsdin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../459/51/index.html">168 Ga. App. 754</a></span>, 755-756 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../459/51/index.html">309 SE2d 921</a></span>) (1983); Gunthorpe v. Daniels, supra. However, when admitted for these purposes as prior substantially similar defects, the foundation must be laid that such occurrences were with the same or similar model steel belted tires, made with the same or similar materials and manufacturing processes, and having substantially similar defects. This does not mean that the defects, tires, or occurrences must be identical, but only sufficiently substantially similar to be probative so that a jury can reasonably draw an inference of defect, causation, dangerousness, knowledge, producing the tire failure, or failure to warn. Mack Trucks v. Conkle, supra; Gen. Motors Corp. v. Moseley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/41/index.html">213 Ga. App. 875</a></span>, 877-878 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/41/index.html">447 SE2d 302</a></span>) (1994); Hayes v. Gary Burnett Trucking, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/99/index.html">203 Ga. App. 693</a></span>, 694 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/99/index.html">417 SE2d 676</a></span>) (1992), overruled on other grounds, Patterson v. Lauderback, <span class="casemissing">211 Ga. App. 891</span>, 893 (<span class="casemissing">440 SE2d 673</span>) (1994); Carlton Co. v. Poss, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../613/37/index.html">124 Ga. App. 154</a></span>, 155 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../613/37/index.html">183 SE2d 231</a></span>) (1971). It is within the trial court's sound discretion to determine whether the prior similar occurrences or tire failures are sufficiently substantially similar to allow the admission of such evidence; this means a continuum of admissible, substantially similar occurrences, where at one extreme the occurrences were the same and at the other extreme the occurrences were barely sufficient to be substantially similar for admission so as not to be an abuse of discretion. Skil Corp. v. Lugsdin, supra at 756; Carlton Co. v. Poss, supra; Wright v. Dilbeck, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../620/27/index.html">122 Ga. App. 214</a></span>, 216-217 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../620/27/index.html">176 SE2d 715</a></span>) (1970).</div><div class="casepar">3. Crosby contends that the trial court erred in excluding Cooper Tire's admissions of the relationship between tire failure and loss of vehicle control and the danger of tire vibration. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">(a) To the extent that there was a prior recall of this model steel belted radial or models similar in design, materials, or manufacturing process so as to be probative, such recall would be admissible. Harley-Davidson Motor Co. v. Daniel, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../856/9/index.html">244 Ga. 284</a></span>, 286 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../856/9/index.html">260 SE2d 20</a></span>) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">The recall letter is admissible as long as there is first introduced some independent proof that the particular product in question suffered from the same defect. . . . [I]t is relevant on the question whether the defect was present when the [tire] left the manufacturer. [Cits.]</div><div class="casepar">Id. at 287. It also may be admissible for other purposes.</div><div class="casepar">(b) In this case, Crosby seeks to use recalls of other brands and types of tires conducted by Cooper Tire, both prior to and after the manufacture of the subject tire, not to prove a defect in this particular tire but to negate the Cooper Tire defenses that driving error caused the rollover or that product misuse caused the rollover by showing that Cooper Tire warned their dealers, but not their users, that tire vibrations were dangerous and that separation of radial belting leads to loss of vehicle control and rollover.</div><div class="casepar">Product misuse did not relieve the manufacturer from liability for a defective product when such misuse was known by the manufacturer or was reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer, as alleged in this case. See Talley v. City Tank Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../495/89/index.html">158 Ga. App. 130</a></span>, 137 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../495/89/index.html">279 SE2d 264</a></span>) (1981). Thus, evidence of the knowledge by Cooper Tire that tire vibration is dangerous and that Cooper Tire warned its dealers of this goes to the issue of foreseeability of the danger from tire vibration and of product misuse by users in continuing to drive with vibrating tires. This knowledge of anticipated driver misuse in turn gave rise to the duty to warn users of the danger from vibrating tires.

Crosby's fourth enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in precluding impeachment of Cooper Tire's expert witness, Stephen Arndt, with inconsistent prior opinions based upon testing by his company which he considered in reaching his opinion in the case. This was a discretionary ruling that the trial court made as to the proper use of impeachment.</div><div class="casepar">(a) This is not a factual situation in which the interest, attitude, and feelings of the witness toward Crosby or Cooper Tire came into play. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/64/index.html">24-9-64</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/68/index.html">24-9-68</a></span>. The fact that Arndt &amp; Associates' employees in different cases reached different opinions for different clients as to the cause of a rollover in a Bronco with a tire blowout does not demonstrate bias or interest; if anything, it demonstrates impartiality. In this case, the trial judge, in his sound discretion, properly limited cross-examination to exclude opinions reached in another case by employees or co-workers. See Duckworth v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../271/71/index.html">223 Ga. App. 250</a></span>, 252 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../271/71/index.html">477 SE2d 336</a></span>) (1996).</div><div class="casepar">(b) If Cooper Tire's accident reconstruction expert Arndt did not take part in the prior case for the injured client, Walsh, where testing was performed to demonstrate that a blowout leads to rollover as causation so as to possess personal knowledge of such tests, then the trial court properly excluded cross-examination regarding the opinions of others, because such alleged prior contradictory opinion as to causation by Arndt's co-workers would not be a prior statement or opinion of the witness for purposes of impeachment by a prior contradictory opinion of Arndt's. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/83/index.html">24-9-83</a></span>. See Waszczak v.

Different expert witnesses can come to divergent opinions based upon the same facts.</div><div class="casepar">(c) However, such evidence of the prior opinions by his colleagues could be admitted to disprove or refute Arndt's own testimony as to causation in this case in rebuttal as impeachment after the defense completes its case. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/82/index.html">24-9-82</a></span>. But to do so, Crosby must first lay a foundation showing sufficient substantial similarity between the prior case and this case to be probative and, second, must also show an exception to the hearsay rule for the admission of the prior expert opinion prepared by a non-witness, unless such colleagues testify, because such conflicting opinion of non-witnesses would become substantive evidence in the case.

Crosby's last enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in precluding expert testimony as to the public's awareness of danger from tire vibration. This is an area where the trial court has discretion to admit or deny expert opinion testimony when the trial court believes that the evidence would be a waste of time, cause undue delay, result in needless presentation of cumulative evidence, or be unhelpful, confusing, or misleading.

See Ryan v. Commrs. of Chatham County, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 730</span>, 733 (1) (<span class="casemissing">48 SE2d 86</span>) (1948); Undercofler v. L. C.

However, while the Bronco, as a SUV, had design characteristics of an off-road vehicle, it was designed and intended primarily for use on public roads. Therefore, the General Assembly intended for seat safety belt legislation to apply to it as a passenger vehicle in order to promote safety.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/8/76.1/index.html">40-8-76.1</a></span> should not be construed to defeat the intent of the General Assembly to promote driver and passenger safety through mandating the wearing of seat belts but at the same time exclude the application to SUVs. See Hollowell v.

Matthews Contracting Co. v. Gover, supra at 109. Although in 1988, when the Act was passed, there were not as many SUVs as today, there was a sufficient number of SUVs on the road that the General Assembly did not intend to exclude them.</div><div class="casepar">" 'Passenger car' means every motor vehicle . . . designed for carrying ten passengers or less and used for transportation of persons." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/1/1/index.html">40-1-1</a></span> (41). While SUVs have a pickup truck chassis, the body is that of a passenger vehicle, fitting the definition of "passenger car" in terms of passenger capacity. " 'Truck' means every motor vehicle designed, used, or maintained primarily for the transportation of property." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/1/1/index.html">40-1-1</a></span> (70). Thus, SUVs more closely fit the definition of a "passenger car" than a "truck" and replace most station wagons as dual purpose vehicles. In the Act, the "exclusion of vehicles mounted on a truck chassis" was intended to exclude trucks and these motor vehicles used primarily to carry more than ten passengers, i.e., buses and mini-buses; it was not intended to exclude SUVs. While the plain language of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/8/76.1/index.html">40-8-76.1</a></span> (a) appears to exclude off-road vehicles and vehicles on a truck chassis from coverage, such literal construction would defeat the legislative purpose of protecting the driving public. Therefore, the statute is to be construed to effectuate its purpose to protect occupants of passenger vehicles. See Bd. of Trustees of the Policemen's Pension &amp;c. v.

In this case, Cooper Tire argues that, although the occupants were not wearing safety belts, they were never charged; thus, the exclusion does not apply. This strained construction flies in the face of the plain language of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/8/76.1/index.html">40-8-76.1</a></span> (d) and the stated purpose of the General Assembly to exclude such fact from evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Cooper Tire contends that the failure to wear seat belts by the occupants of the Bronco was relevant and admissible for the limited purposes of (1) reduction of any damages; (2) refutation of an element of plaintiffs' failure to warn claim; and (3) impeachment. The language of the Act is plain and unambiguous when it says that failure to wear a safety belt "shall not be considered by the court on any question of liability" and "shall not diminish any recovery for damages arising out of the . . . occupancy, or operation of a passenger vehicle." Ga. L. 1988, p. 33,  1.

Thus, unlike general rules of evidence which permit admission of evidence for one purpose although not for other purposes, the legislative intent of the statute was to prohibit the admission of evidence that no seat belt was worn for all purposes. See generally Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../541/66/index.html">146 Ga.

      Jackson v. Ensley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../459/76/index.html">168 Ga. App. 822</a></span>, 827-828 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../459/76/index.html">310 SE2d 707</a></span>) (1983), held that the prior contradictory opinion of a lay witness could be introduced for the limited purpose of impeachment, but that the trial court should instruct the jury that the prior opinion was admitted for the limited purpose of impeachment of that witness. See also Shropshire v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../265/03/index.html">226 Ga. App. 669</a></span>, 670-671 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../265/03/index.html">487 SE2d 384</a></span>) (1997). The failure to instruct as to the limited purpose of its admission will not require a new trial. See Jackson v. Ensley, supra at 828; Pound v. Medney, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../429/44/index.html">176 Ga.

      The General Assembly wished to promote passenger safety by mandating safety belt wearing, but avoid any common law negligence either under comparative or contributory negligence or mitigation of damages. Thus, it prohibited the admission of evidence for such purposes. See former case law showing what was excluded by statute: Jones v. Livingston, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../333/06/index.html">203 Ga. App. 99</a></span>, 102 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../333/06/index.html">416 SE2d 142</a></span>) (1992); Jones v.
