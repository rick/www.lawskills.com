Before Judge Cobb. Walton Superior Court. May 10, 1954.</div><div class="casepresiding">NICHOLS, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Where the evidence shows that the plaintiff was an invitee of a tenant and sustained an injury by reason of the defendant landlords' failure to repair a defect in the premises occupied by the tenant, and where the evidence also fails to show that landlords retained any right to possession of the premises rented to the tenant, and shows that the tenant had not given, nor had the landlords received, notice of the defect causing the plaintiff's injury, the verdict for the plaintiff was unauthorized by the evidence, and the court erred in denying the defendants' motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. A. G. Shockley brought suit against Harry B. Nunnally, Frances N. Napier, and Clara Knox Nunnally Roberts, on the following alleged facts: The defendants are the owners, as tenants in common, of a two-story brick building, known as the Eulalia Building, in Monroe. There are stores and an office on the first floor and offices and shops on the second floor. There is a lobby at the foot of stairs leading up to the second floor, and entrances are provided from the lobby to the stores and office on the first floor. The lobby was for the use of the general public in patronizing the stores and offices of the building.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants were the devisees of a remainder interest in the building, subject to a life estate in Mary Eulalia Nunnally, under the will of W. J. Nunnally, and then came into possession of the property on April 27, 1952, when Mary Eulalia Nunnally died. On May 9, 1952, the defendants employed Trust Company of Georgia as their agent to maintain and supervise the building, to keep it insured, and to collect the rents, and the bank was acting as the defendants' agent at the time of the plaintiff's injuries.</div><div class="casepar">M. G. Crossley operated a store on the first floor of the building, and on November 15, 1952, the plaintiff entered the Crossley store from the lobby to purchase some ice cream. At the entrance, two screen doors, each one-half the width of the doorway, opened outward into the lobby. The plaintiff pulled back the door on her right to enter. A threshold (sill or saddle?) had been placed on the floor beneath the double doors and was held in place only by a roofing nail, which was not of the type used for this purpose. The threshold was loose; under it was a space about one inch wide and one inch deep between the floor of the store and the floor of the lobby. The plaintiff's shoe moved the loose threshold, exposing the crack between the two floors. With her shoe in contact with the crack and the loose threshold, the plaintiff was tripped and thrown to the floor of the store, fracturing her left femur. The single nail on the left end of the threshold was obscured by the left screen door, and the crack between the floors was also obscured by the doors. The plaintiff was injured at about 1 p. m., when the building and the stores were open for public patronage, and the plaintiff was an invitee of the defendants. The plaintiff did not know of the loose threshold and the crack beneath it, and these defects were not obvious to the plaintiff in the exercise of ordinary care. The defendants knew, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, of the dangerous condition of the entrance to Crossley's store from the lobby of their building.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants' general demurrer to the foregoing allegations of the petition was overruled, and they except.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants also except to the denial of their motion for a new trial, after the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on the trial of the case.</div><div class="casepar">The petition does not show that the defendants had parted with possession of any part of their building. Hence, the defendants' alleged liability is simply that of owners or occupiers of land to an invitee for "failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe." Code  105-401. The petition alleges facts sufficient to raise a jury question as to whether the defendants breached their duty, to the plaintiff's injury, and the court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence presents a case differing from that alleged. It appears that Crossley and the plaintiff were tenants of the defendants, occupying different parts of the building; that the plaintiff entered Crossley's store as a customer intending to buy ice cream; that Crossley had never noticed anything wrong with the threshold until five or six hours after the plaintiff was injured; and that neither Crossley nor his employee, Ridder, had ever reported any defects in it to anyone. The threshold board, or door sill, or saddle, was under the "permanent door," and the screen doors were beyond it, towards the lobby of the building. The janitor of the building, who swept the lobby, halls, and steps, did not have anything to do with cleaning the store; Crossley cleaned it. The defendants, two officers of the Trust Company of Georgia who were in charge of renting and maintaining the property, and an officer of Nunnally Lumber Company, authorized to make emergency repairs, all testified that they had been given no notice of the defective threshold, and did not know about it.</div><div class="casepar">The invitee of a tenant is controlled by the rules governing the tenant as to the right of recovery for injuries arising from failure to keep the premises in repair. Crossgrove v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 462</span>, 464 (2) (118 S. E. 694). "When the tenant is in the exclusive possession and control of the rented premises, the landlord is under no duty of examining the same with a view to ascertaining whether or not repairs are needed, unless requested so to do." Ocean Steamship Co. v. Hamilton, <span class="casemissing">112 Ga. 901 (2)</span> (38 S. E. 204); Stack v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 149</span> (36 S. E. 615). And where the landlord has neither possession nor right to possession, he must have reasonable notice of the defective condition of the premises before he can be held liable for injuries resulting to his tenants or their invitee from such defects. Shattles v. Blanchard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../712/02/index.html">87 Ga. App. 15</a></span>, 16 (73 S. E. 2d 112); Echols v. Patterson, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 372</span> (4 S. E. 2d 81).</div><div class="casepar">While the defendants may have retained a qualified possession of the steps, halls, and lobby of their building, the defective threshold was located beneath the door to premises which were rented to Crossley and to which he had the right of possession. Code  61-101. It was not shown that the defendants had any notice of the defect, and hence they were not liable for the plaintiff's injury caused by their failure to repair the defect.</div><div class="casepar">The fact that the defendants had authorized Trust Company of Georgia and Nunnally Lumber Company to make repairs is immaterial, since the duty of the defendants' agents was no greater than that of their principals: to repair defects on reasonable notice. The defective threshold, being on premises to which the defendant landlords had no right of entry, was not a defect which should have been discovered by them in the exercise of ordinary care.</div><div class="casepar">The verdict for the plaintiff was unauthorized by the evidence, and for this reason the court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial. The rulings complained of in the special grounds of the motion are not likely to recur, and so these grounds of the motion are not passed upon.</div><div class="casepar">On motion for rehearing the original judgment of affirmance in part and reversal in part is adhered to. Felton, C. J., Gardner, P. J., Townsend, J., and Carlisle, J., concur. Quillian, J., dissents.</div><div class="casepar">QUILLIAN, J., dissenting. There can be no question as to the soundness of the holding of the majority opinion that the landlord is not ordinarily required to inspect the premises the possession and control of which he has yielded to a tenant, and that in such circumstances, in the absence of proof that he was put on notice of such defect, he is not liable to an invitee of the tenant caused by the failure to repair. I also agree with my colleagues that, under authority of Dobbs v. Noble, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 201</span> (189 S. E. 694), the rule is applicable even to structural defects in a structure built by the landlord's predecessor in title.</div><div class="casepar">I do not agree that the general rule is necessarily applicable in this case, for the reason that there was evidence from which the jury could have legitimately concluded that the landlords had retained such qualified control over the rented premises that they were chargeable with the duty to inspect the store room rented to the tenant Crossley and were responsible for injury to the plaintiff arising out of a failure on their part to perform that duty.</div><div class="casepar">The Eulalia Building was originally owned by the landlords' father, and was inherited by them. At the time Mr. Grossley was a tenant occupying the store room in the building. The evidence does not disclose what the rental contract between the father and the tenant Crossley provided as to inspection of the premises. Nor does it appear that, upon the building becoming their property, the landlords entered into any contract of rental with Mr. Crossley. The evidence shows that he remained a tenant and continued to occupy the store building. There was no evidence as to whether the rental contract originally entered into between the landlord's father and the tenant Crossley reserved to the original landlord the right of inspection of the premises or what the agreement between Crossley and the defendant was in respect to that matter. Authority for the proposition that, where a landlord retains qualified possession or control of premises in person or by agent, he is liable for defects that were discoverable by reasonable diligence are: Smith v State Mutual Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 747</span>, 750 (151 S. E. 554), Monahan v. National Realty Co., <span class="casemissing">4 Ga. App. 680</span> (62 S. E. 127), Marr v. Dieter, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 711 (2)</span> (109 S. E. 532), Davis v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 265</span>, 268 (94 S. F. 274), Augusta-Aiken Ry. Co. v. Hafer, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 216</span> (94 S. E. 322).</div><div class="casepar">One of the ways a landlord retains qualified control of the rental premises for the purpose of inspection is by appointing an agent and empowering him to perform that function. Smith v. Stovall, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../718/81/index.html">84 Ga. App. 103 (3)</a></span> (65 S. E. 2d 640).</div><div class="casepar">The evidence does disclose that the landlords entered into an agreement with Trust Company of Georgia, by the terms of which they agreed for the trust company to take over the control of the entire building, to collect the rents from the same, and keep it in repair. The parts of the contract material to consideration of this case read: "Principals are the owners of a certain properties fully identified in "Exhibit A" hereto attached. Principals desire to place said properties in agent's custody for management and servicing. Agent is willing to undertake said service and duties imposed hereby, upon the terms set forth herein.</div><div class="casepar">"Now, therefore, it is mutually agreed by and between principals and agent as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"1. Principals hereby employ agent, who accepts said employment, to render the following services in connection with said properties:</div><div class="casepar">"(a) To hold said properties in its custody and control and others that may be added.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Generally to represent principals in the management thereof.</div><div class="casepar">(c) To determine the tenants and rates of rents they pay but agent shall make no rental or lease contract for longer than one (1) year without first obtaining written approval of principals.</div><div class="casepar">(d) To collect the rents and other income, if any, from the properties placed in this agency and quarterly to distribute equally to the principals the net income, after reserving such amounts thereof as agent estimates to be proper for repairs, ad valorem taxes and other expenses.</div><div class="casepar">"(f) From funds in the agency account, the agent is authorized to pay the ad valorem taxes, insurance premiums and other similar fixed charges as they become due.</div><div class="casepar">"(g) To keep accurate books of account on all transactions in respect to said properties and funds received and to render semi-annually detailed statements to principals.</div><div class="casepar">"(h) To supply from time to time such information as agent may possess for the purpose of having income and intangible tax returns prepared for principals.</div><div class="casepar">"(i) To prepare ad valorem tax returns for the real estate managed hereunder by agent."</div><div class="casepar">The contract constituted an admission in writing that the defendants had the right to inspect the building, including the Crossley store, and the corresponding liability for failure to exercise ordinary care in discovering defects and making necessary repairs.</div><div class="casepar">It is not necessary for the parties in the case to have been originally concerned in the transaction between the defendants and the Trust Company to avail themselves of the defendants' written admission that they had retained the right incident to a qualified possession of the entire Eulalia Building. Nor was it essential that the contract state in express terms that the defendants retained such right. The language of the contract is a clear assertion on the part of the defendants both that they had and were exercising that right to inspect the store space occupied by Crossley.</div><div class="casepar">In my opinion there was ample evidence for the jury to have predicated the verdict returned by them in the plaintiff's favor.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">A.
