Bonner, Sheriff of DeKalb County, Theron Burgess, Clerk of the Superior Court of DeKalb County, and Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc.</div><div class="casepar">to "The Decatur-DeKalb News"; and that "The Decatur-DeKalb News," published by the Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., was not qualified to be the official organ of DeKalb County in that it had not been continuously mailed to a list of bona fide subscribers for a period of two years and less than eighty-five percent of its total circulation was paid circulation.</div><div class="casepar">The prayers were that mandamus issue to compel the three officers named as defendants to perform the duty imposed upon them to designate a qualified newspaper as official organ of DeKalb County; to restrain and enjoin these defendants from changing the designation of the official organ; and to restrain and enjoin the Decatur News Publishing Company from accepting and publishing advertisements required to be published in the official legal organ of DeKalb County.</div><div class="casepar">A mandamus nisi was issued and a hearing set, and answers were filed by all defendants denying the material allegations.</div><div class="casepar">Upon the trial after evidence was presented the defendants were granted directed verdicts in their favor and a judgment was entered thereon which found the following facts:</div><div class="casepar">"1. That in September, 1971, the defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., commenced printing, publishing, and circulating 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' weekly journal or newspaper in DeKalb County, Georgia, separate and apart from two other newspapers the DeKalb News North and DeKalb News South.</div><div class="casepar">"2. These three separate and different newspapers formed a family of weekly journals printed, published and circulated in DeKalb County, Georgia, by the said defendant commencing in September, 1971, and continuing to date.</div><div class="casepar">"3. That in September, 1971, the defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., commenced mailing its weekly journal 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' to a list of bona fide subscribers totalling more than 85% of the circulation of said journal as paid circulation.</div><div class="casepar">"4. In April, 1972, the defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., acquired all the assets and liabilities of 'The DeKalb Tribune' weekly newspaper being printed, published and circulated in DeKalb County, Georgia, since 1968. At the time of acquisition, 'The DeKalb Tribune' weekly newspaper was being mailed to a list of bona fide subscribers totalling more than 85% of the circulation of said journal as paid circulation in DeKalb County, Georgia, and at the time of said acquisition, such circulation of 'The DeKalb Tribune' weekly newspaper was mailed to approximately 5,200 bona fide subscribers and had been continuing since 1968.</div><div class="casepar">"5. In April, 1972, the Defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., merged the aforesaid circulation of 'The DeKalb Tribune' newspaper into its weekly journal 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' and mailed 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' newspaper to the said bona fide subscribers to 'The DeKalb Tribune' in DeKalb County, Georgia, until publication of 'The DeKalb Tribune' newspaper was terminated by the Defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc.</div><div class="casepar">"6. Upon termination of the publication of 'The DeKalb Tribune' newspaper by the said defendant, 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' weekly journal became the direct successor of 'The DeKalb Tribune' weekly newspaper and as such successor 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' journal was circulated by mail to those bona fide paid subscribers to 'The DeKalb Tribune' newspaper who elected to receive 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' in lieu of 'The DeKalb Tribune' newspaper, and said circulation of 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' weekly journal is presently continuing in DeKalb County, Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">"7. 'The Decatur-DeKalb News' Weekly Journal printed, published and circulated in DeKalb County, Georgia by the Defendant, Decatur News Publishing Company, Inc., meets the requirements of law as stated in Georgia Code Section 39-1103 and is legally qualified to be designated as the official legal organ of DeKalb County, Georgia, and it was qualified as such on March 29, 1973, when it was officially and legally designated as such by the constitutional officers of DeKalb County, Georgia namely: Theron Burgess, Clerk Superior Court and Rayburn L. Bonner, Sheriff, DeKalb County.</div><div class="casepar">"8. The court finds as a matter of law pursuant to Georgia Code Section 81A-150 (a) that there is no conflict in the evidence as to any material issue and the evidence introduced, with all reasonable deductions therefrom, demands that the defendant's motion for directed verdicts be granted."</div><div class="casepar">The statute providing for the method of selection of the official organ of a county and the qualifications of such organ recites that "No journal or newspaper published in this State shall be declared or made the official organ of any county for the publication of sheriff's sales, ordinary's citations or any other advertising commonly known and termed 'official or legal advertising' and required by law to be published in such county official newspaper, unless such newspaper shall have been continuously published and mailed to a list of bona fide subscribers for a period of two years, or is the direct successor of such journal or newspaper, and unless 85 percent of the circulation of such newspaper or journal is paid circulation. No change shall be made in the official organ of any county except upon the concurrent action of the ordinary, sheriff and clerk of the superior court of said county or a majority of said officers: Provided, that in counties where no journal or newspaper has been established for two years the official organ may be designated by the ordinary, sheriff and clerk of the superior court, a majority of these officers governing." Ga. L. 1910, p. 87; 1953, Nov. Sess., pp. 271, 272 (Code Ann.  39-1103).</div><div class="casepar">It is undisputed that a change in the designation of the official organ was made. The Sheriff and the Clerk of the Superior Court of DeKalb County, who constituted a majority of the officers authorized to make a change, entered such an order on March 29, 1973.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant insists, however, that there is a question of fact as to whether "The Decatur-DeKalb News" was the "direct successor" of "The DeKalb Tribune" so as to qualify it to be the official organ under the applicable statute. It argues that since the witness Crane testified that "The Decatur-DeKalb News" existed and operated in its present form at least eight months prior to the cessation of the publication of "The DeKalb Tribune," and that since the circulation of"The Decatur-DeKalb News" was increased by only 60 new subscribers thereby, it cannot be considered to be the successor of "The DeKalb Tribune."</div><div class="casepar">This argument is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">The interpretation of the word "successor" as used in the statute is not a question of fact but a question of law. Since there was no conflict in the evidence as to the facts involving the acquisition of "The DeKalb Tribune," the trial court properly determined that there was no issue for the jury in this regard.</div><div class="casepar">It should also be pointed out that this issue has since become moot since the evidence shows that the Decatur News Publishing Company began publishing "The Decatur-DeKalb News" in September of 1971, and that therefore it now meets the standards of the statute regardless of whether it is a successor to "The DeKalb Tribune."</div><div class="casepar">Finally, there was no dispute in the evidence that "The Decatur-DeKalb News" was a newspaper published in DeKalb County, Georgia, which had at the time of trial more than eighty-five percent paid circulation.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant's contention that the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that the Decatur News Publishing Company published "The Decatur-DeKalb News" separate and apart from two other newspapers which were without paid circulation, because "a jury could have determined from the evidence that the purported separate identities of the papers were artificial and not substantive," cannot be sustained.</div><div class="casepar">Again, there was no jury question because there was no conflict in the evidence. The only evidence introduced in this regard was the testimony of the witness Crane. He stated that "The Decatur-DeKalb News" and the two other papers had different editors, writers, copy and editorial policies, although they had the same advertising. He explained that advertisements could be purchased only as a "forced combination" in all three papers, which was also the manner that advertising was sold in "The Atlanta Constitution" and "The Atlanta Journal" and area newspapers in many other localities.</div><div class="casepar">From this undisputed evidence the trial court correctly concluded as a matter of law that "The Decatur-DeKalb News" was published and circulated separate and apart from the other two newspapers published by the Decatur News Publishing Company.</div><div class="casepar">From the foregoing it is apparent that the appellant was not entitled to mandamus since it did not show that it had a clear legal right to the relief sought.

Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/39/index.html">218 Ga. 508</a></span>, 509 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/39/index.html">128 SE2d 735</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">We find no error in the proceedings.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
