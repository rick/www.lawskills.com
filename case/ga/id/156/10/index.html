Construing counts III and IV most strongly against the petitioners as must be done on general demurrer, they allege that the State Highway Department was closing the county road in question and not Elbert County, thus these counts did not state causes of action for temporary and permanent injunction against Elbert County, and the trial judge erred in overruling the general demurrer of Elbert County to counts III and IV.</div><div class="casepar">3. (a) Counts III and IV alleging that the State Highway Department filed with the county commissioners of Elbert County plans of a State-aid road project which showed inclusion of a portion of a county road into the State highway system as a State-aid road, which project the county commissioners approved, that the requirements of Code  95-1705 as to notice of designation of a county road as a State-aid road.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The State has the power to have opened, worked, repaired, improved or closed the public highways, streets, and roads, which power may be exercised by the legislature in such manner and way, and under such circumstances, as it may deem best; and the legislature has delegated to the State Highway Department full control of and authority over State-aid roads, including the right to locate and relocate such roads, which includes the power to close county roads or city streets, where in its discretion such is necessary in the location, relocation, or construction of State-aid road projects, subject to the limitation that it must not abuse its discretion.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Counts III and IV fail to state causes of action to temporarily and permanently enjoin the State Highway Department from closing a county road to traffic into and on a portion of that road taken into the highway system as a State-aid road, the Department possessing such authority, and there being no facts alleged showing an abuse of discretion on the part of the Department.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Neither of counts III and IV having stated a cause of action for injunction against the State Highway Department, the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction against it.</div><div class="casepar"> The thirteen plaintiffs, all of whom are engaged in the granite business, either as producers or haulers, filed their petition, as amended, in four courts against the defendants, Elbert County, the State Highway Department of Georgia, and Knox-Rivers Construction Company. Counts I and II are identical except that the basis for the relief sought is not the same, in count I it being that Elbert County is in the process of closing a public road, which leads to petitioners' property, and their action is ultra vires and contrary to law because they have not complied with the requirements of Code Ch. 95-2 by giving notice, etc. In count II it is alleged that the acts of the defendants "are unconstitutional, null and void, as being in violation of Art. I, Sec. III, Par. I of the Georgia Constitution (Code  2-301) which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public purposes without just and adequate compensation being first paid," in that petitioners are deprived of access to their property. Counts III and IV contain the additional allegations that defendant State Highway Department is proceeding to block and close off the end of the connecting road referred to hereinbefore by placing barriers at the end of said road where it intersects with State Highways 17 and 72, and "the effect of such blocking by defendant State Highway Department . . . is to prevent the passage of traffic over such road to and from plaintiff's place of business." In addition, count III alleges that the State Highway Department has not designated the county road in question as a State-aid road and count IV contains the additional allegation (not in the other counts) that "the effect of the blocking and closing is to virtually destroy the usefulness of the entire road, and such blocking constitutes a nuisance."</div><div class="casepar">In each of the counts the prayers are that defendant Elbert County be temporarily and permanently enjoined from effectuating the discontinuance of the said road, and that defendants, State Highway Department and Knox-Rivers Construction Company be temporarily and permanently enjoined from proceeding with construction on the project in such manner as will result in destruction, removal and abolition of said county road.</div><div class="casepar">By separate bills of exceptions, the State Highway Department, Elbert County, and the plaintiffs who brought the petition, except to certain rulings of the judgment entered by the trial court. We deal first with the case of the State Highway Department of Georgia v. James A. MacDonald, as the rulings made therein will control in the other two cases, number 23027 and 23029.</div><div class="casepar">1. (a) Counts I and II of the petition alleging that Elbert County by and through its governing authority, the Board of County Commissioners, has announced its intention to permanently close and abandon a described county road, has commenced installation of a power pole in the middle road and has advised that said road will not re-opened after temporary barricades installed pending construction are no longer needed; that the defendant Knox-Rivers Construction Company, which is constructing the State highway under contract with the State Highway Department, is proceeding, to grade and excavate away the said county road and will permanently destroy and abolish it; that the actions of the defendants are ultra vires and contrary to law, in that the defendant county has not first complied with requirements of Code Ch. 95-2 by giving notice, publishing citation or notifying petitioners that claims for damages may be asserted, states a cause of action as against general demurrer for injunction to temporarily and permanently enjoin Elbert County from closing the road. The county has not authority to close a county road except by compliance with the requirements of Code Ch. 95-2. The court did not err in overruling the general demurrer of EIbert County to counts I and II.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The trial court properly denied a temporary injunction against Elbert County, for, as the court found from the evidence offered at the interlocutory hearing, Elbert County did not close the road. The evidence was undisputed that the State Highway Department and not Elbert County closed the road.</div><div class="casepar">2. Counts III and IV of the petition first allege that Elbert County closed the road and by amendment was added the allegation that the State Highway Department was in the process of barricading and closing the road to traffic. Construing those conflicting allegations most strongly against petitioner as must be done on general demurrer, they allege that the State Highway Department closed the road and not Elbert County. Thus counts III and IV do not state a cause of action for injunction against Elbert County and the general demurrer of Elbert County to those counts should have been sustained.</div><div class="casepar">3. The next question is, do they state a cause of action against the State Highway Department for injunction from barricading this road against traffic entering thereon from the road of which it had been a part.</div><div class="casepar">The basis upon which those counts rest is that the State Highway Department has no right to close a county road. More is involved than the mere closing of a county road, for the petition shows that the State Highway Department has incorporated a described part of this county road into the State highway system as a part of a State-aid road. In this connection the petition alleges that the County Commissioners of Elbert County procured the approval of the State Highway Department of a proscribed road project, a copy of the plans being attached to the petition; that the county commissioners approved and consented to the project as per the plans; and the plans show the incorporation of that portion of the county road in question into the State-aid road under construction. At the time the petition was filed, the contractor had begun construction on the project and was grading and bringing this road and the State-aid road project. While there is no specific allegation that written notice had been given the county commissioners that this road was designated as a part of the State-aid road system, as required by Code  95-1705, the facts alleged to the effect that the plans of the construction project, which showed that the portion of the county road in question would be incorporated into a State-aid road, were submitted to the county commissioners and were consented to by them and work was begun thereon are sufficient to constitute compliance with this section. This was written notice to the county commissioners that the road was being made a part of a State-aid road system.</div><div class="casepar">The question is whether the petition alleges a cause of action for injunction. The question of compensation for damages suffered by plaintiffs by reason of defendants' interfering with their ingress and egress to and from their property is now before us. It would appear that if such damage has been suffered by plaintiffs they have an adequate remedy at law. Doughtery County v. Hornsby, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../176/23/index.html">213 Ga. 114 (97 SE2d 300)</a></span> and cases cited.</div><div class="casepar">The petition did not state a cause of action for enjoining the State Highway Department from placing barricades at the entrance to that part of the county road taken into the State highway system, so as to prevent traffic entering upon said road. Thus, the trial court erred in overruling the general demurrer of the State Highway Department to counts III and IV.</div><div class="casepar">Since the petition did not state a cause of action for injunction against the State Highway Department the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction against it.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part.
