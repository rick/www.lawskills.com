E. Garner for damages resulting from a collision between an automobile in which she was a guest passenger and one driven by Garner.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleged in part: On June 10, 1957, at approximately 11:20 in the evening petitioner was injured while a guest passenger in a 1955 Pontiac automobile owned by C. O. Brown and driven by B. C. Brown in an easterly direction on Edgewood Avenue, between the intersection of Hilliard and Yonge Streets, within the corporate limits of the City of Atlanta, when the Pontiac automobile in which she was riding was struck in the rear while moving slowly in a line of traffic which was moving eastward on Edgewood Avenue, by an automobile which was being operated by C. E. Garner in an easterly direction along Edgewood Avenue, in a reckless and dangerous manner and the circumstances of petitioner's injuries were as hereinafter more fully described; at said time and place the defendant failed to have his vehicle under immediate control; at the time of her injury, the defendant was driving his Mercury station wagon automobile carelessly and heedlessly and in disregard of the rights and safety of petitioner and without due caution, care and circumspection and with such speed as to endanger petitioner under the circumstances and that the automobile driven by the defendant disregarded the automobile traveling in front of him at the time and place and drove his Mercury station wagon automobile suddenly, unexpectedly and without warning and with great force and violence into the rear of the Pontiac automobile in which petitioner was seated on the left side of the rear seat; this in violation of a valid and binding ordinance of the City of Atlanta which provides as follows: "30.38 The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle"; the defendant negligently disregarded the vehicle in front of him and drove the front of the Mercury station wagon into the rear of the Pontiac with great force and violence, knocking the automobile in which petitioner was seated approximately ten feet; this in violation of the aforesaid ordinance; under the circumstances herein alleged the defendant failed to give petitioner any warning so that she could brace herself, and that it was not his intention to stop or drive around the Pontiac in front of him, but to drive his automobile into the rear of the Pontiac in which petitioner was riding with great force and violence; petitioner shows that the defendant was aware of the fact that Edgewood Avenue, at the place, was a heavily traveled street and that if he drove his automobile along said street without determining if the street was clear in front of him at this time and place as herein alleged, petitioner or some other person would likely be injured; as a result of the sudden and violent impact of the Garner automobile with the automobile in which petitioner was a guest passenger, she was suddenly and violently thrown about in the automobile and that as a result her entire body was battered, bruised, twisted and wrenched and that the ligaments and muscles of her body were strained, twisted and bruised and her entire nervous system has undergone irreparable damage; petitioner shows that she was in the exercise of ordinary care as a guest passenger in the automobile driven by B. C. Brown and that the hereinafter stated acts of negligence of the defendant were the proximate cause of petitioner's injuries, and he was</div><div class="casepar">negligent in the following particulars; (a) in failing to apply brakes and stop the station wagon before running into the rear of the automobile in which petitioner was a passenger at the time and place; (b) in failing in overtaking the Pontiac in which petitioner was riding to pass to the left at a safe distance, this in violation of a city ordinance quoted above; (c) in failing to keep a lookout ahead and failing to see petitioner; (d) in failing to warn petitioner by horn or gong that he did not intend to stop the station wagon before driving into the automobile in which petitioner was a passenger at the time and place; (e) in failing to have the automobile under immediate control so that it could have been stopped.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed an answer in which he denied the material allegations of the petition.</div><div class="casepar">On the trial the jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The judge denied the motion for a new trial and the defendant excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. Special ground 1 of the amended motion for a new trial complains that the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence a copy of Section 30-38 of the Code and General Ordinances of the City of Atlanta which provides: "30-38. The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereto at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle."</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the defendant insists that the admission of the above ordinance was error because there was no evidence that the collision occurred within the city limits of Atlanta.</div><div class="casepar">On the trial T. J. Crutchfield, an Atlanta Police patrolman, testified in part: "Q. How long have you been a police patrolman of the City of Atlanta, Mr. Crutchfield? A. Almost four years. Q. And in that period of four years, has that been duties as a police patrolman for the whole four years? A. Yes. Q. Now Officer Crutchfield, I will ask you whether or not on or about June 10, 1957 you had an occasion to investigate a collision? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you investigate it? A. Yes, sir. Q. You did. And where did this collision occur? A. In the three hundred block of Edgewood Avenue, N. E. Q. Now upon your arrival I will ask you this. Between what streets was this on Edgewood Avenue? A. At that time I was not familiar with that section of town. I have my report listed as 341 Edgewood. Q. Have you since become familiar with that section of town? A. Not good enough to tell you what block would be within. Q. Now, Crutchfield, you say it was in the three hundred block of Edgewood Avenue according to your report? A. Yes. Q. I will ask you about what time you arrived at the scene of the collision? A. Approximately 11:25 p.m. Q. And upon your arrival at the scene of the collision, can you tell this court and jury what makes of automobiles were involved in the collision? A. It was a Mercury station wagon and Pontiac sedan. Q. Now who was driving the Pontiac sedan? A. Bertram G. Brown. Q. Who was driving the Mercury station wagon? A. Calvin E. Garner. Q. There were quite a few people and automobiles at the scene when you arrived? A. Yes. Q. Whenever there is a wreck a crowd seems to gather? A. Yes. Q. It may have been cars of those people? A. It is possible, yes. Q. Are you familiar enough with that area of Atlanta to be able to tell us whether there is a very heavy traffic at 11:20 or 11:25 at night on a rainy sort of night? A. I couldn't say whether it is usual but there was an awful lot of traffic that night. Q. That is people coming to the scene? A. Yes, because we had trouble with the traffic situation."</div><div class="casepar">The above evidence was sufficient to establish the fact that the collision occurred within the city limits of Atlanta and the special ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 2 of the motion for new trial is controlled by what is held in division 1 of this opinion, and is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special ground 3 assigns as error the following charge: "The plaintiff alleges and contends that the defendant violated a city ordinance of Atlanta. These city ordinances are to be obeyed if they are reasonable and there has been a violation of such ordinances and this one reads: 'The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right-hand side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle.' You would look to the evidence and determine whether or not the defendant violated this city ordinance of Atlanta. If you believe he did, then it would be your duty to go further and inquire whether or not the violation of this city ordinance, if such appears, was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries and if you believe it was, then I charge you that that would be negligence per se because it is in violation of the law itself." Counsel for the defendant insists that the above charge was error because there was no evidence adduced upon the trial which would raise the issue that the defendant's automobile overtook or was attempting to pass the automobile in which the plaintiff was riding. With this contention we cannot agree. The plaintiff testified in part that the automobile in which she was riding was moving forward on the street at the time of the collision. There was also evidence that the defendant's automobile struck the automobile in which the plaintiff was riding in the rear. Therefore, the only way the collision could have occurred was for the defendant's automobile to overtake the one in which the plaintiff was riding and the above ordinance would be applicable to the facts of the case. The special ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">4. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, and the general grounds of the motion for a new trial are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Felton, C.
