As to the claim of negligent hiring and retention remaining against the city and its police chief (jointly referred to herein as the "City"), the court entered summary judgment in their favor. Harper appeals, claiming evidence shows the City had constructive knowledge of Crook's propensity to commit this act.</div><div class="casepar">1. The City contends the statute of limitation had run prior to the filing of the complaint.

[v.

The City persuaded the trial court that Harper presented no evidence it had constructive knowledge of Crook s propensity to sexually assault another person. "An employer's liability for negligent hiring or retention of an employee requires proof that the employer knew or should have known of the employee's propensity to engage in the conduct which caused the plaintiff's injury." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Proof of such leaning must consist of evidence substantially related to the injury-causing conduct. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Lying about employment qualifications, for example, does not constitute evidence of violent tendencies. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Harper presented evidence from which a jury could find that the City should have known that Crook was prone to committing a sexual assault. Construed in plaintiff's favor, the evidence shows that prior to hiring Crook the City was aware he had pled guilty to making harassing phone calls to a female companion and had misrepresented in his employment application his relationship to that woman, hiding the incident. After Crook's hiring, a citizen's complaint about Crook resulted in an investigation that uncovered three sexually inappropriate encounters between Crook and female citizens.</div><div class="casepar">In the first, Crook, while purporting to conduct an investigation, queried a woman in a parking lot. During the encounter he asked whether she was cold in her spandex shorts and leered at her body. Feeling "eerie," she walked away, only to have him follow her very slowly in his police car. He approached her again, asking her if she had seen a suspect, to which she replied she had not. She started walking homeward at a fast pace, and he again followed her in his car, staring. She took a back entrance to her apartment complex so he could no longer follow her.</div><div class="casepar">About a month later (again while conducting an "investigation"), he asked a second woman in the same neighborhood whether she was wearing shorts under her nightgown, commented on her tan, inquired if she was married, and remarked that she needed a boyfriend to take care of her. She responded negatively to his inquiries. He called her to his car window and asked her a second time if she was sure she did not need a boyfriend. Later he came to her house to speak to her again when he suspected that she had complained of his conduct and that a formal investigation was underway. She did not pursue the matter further for fear of Crook.</div><div class="casepar">The third woman spoke of an uncomfortable encounter occurring around the same time. While making official inquiries, Crook had tried to look around her door as she stood in her nightgown behind it.</div><div class="casepar">Crook's conduct, as reported to the City, represented an increasingly aggressive progression of sexual deviancy. Beginning with a guilty plea on making harassing phone calls to a woman, the behavior escalated to asking intimate questions of female citizens, to following a woman in a police car, to repeatedly asking a female citizen if she needed a boyfriend, to trying to peer around a door at a woman in her nightgown -- all the time while using his badge and the cover of official police investigation to try to cow these women into submission.</div><div class="casepar">A jury could find that Crook's conduct gave warning to the City that his behavior reflected an escalating sexual deviancy likely to result eventually in the sexual assault of a female while he was on duty. Significantly, the female officer investigating the matter for the City reported to her superior that based on the standard sex crimes courses in which all officers are trained, she felt Crook's behavior was a "textbook case" of sexual deviancy and should be investigated further. The male superior ignored the suggestion and simply told Crook not to repeat the behavior. No professional counseling, no reassignment to team him with another officer, no sanction to curb future behavior was imposed. Tragically for Harper, the one-time instruction was insufficient.</div><div class="casepar">Unlike Bunn-Penn v. Southern Regional Med. Corp., <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> prior to the Harper incident Crook did not merely exhibit voyeuristic tendencies. He acted upon those tendencies by harassing women and following one in his car. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Moreover, Crook was a police officer, a position that wields enormous power and intimidation over those vulnerable citizens an officer is sworn to protect. The City as his employer owed a higher duty to protect citizens from abuse of that power, a duty which private employers do not share. Under the Georgia Constitution, "[p]rotection to person and property is the paramount duty of government. . . ." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Even security employers are expected to exercise greater care in employment decisions. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Those responsible for clothing citizens with police power must be even more vigilant.</div><div class="casepar">The court erred in granting summary judgment to the City of East Point on the negligent retention claim.</div><div class="casepar">The negligent hiring claim against the City of East Point and Chief McLendon has no merit, for at the time of hiring the evidence of Crook's deviancy was, standing alone, insufficient to alert the employer of a potential sexual aggressor. The expert testimony of inadequate investigation was not submitted to the court before the summary judgment hearing, but was filed after the court entered its order. The court properly exercised its discretion to refuse to consider that evidence. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> Summary judgment on the negligent hiring claim in favor of the City of East Point and Chief McLendon was proper.</div><div class="casepar">3. Chief McLendon asserted official immunity as an additional defense.</div><div class="casepar">The Act contains a</div><div class="casepar">definition of discretionary function or duty: "a function or duty requiring a state officer or employee to exercise his or her policy judgment in choosing among alternate courses of action based upon a consideration of social, political, or economic factors." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/21/22/index.html">50-21-22</a></span> (2). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Hiring, firing, and disciplining an individual as a police officer require the exercise of professional deliberation and judgment. Chief McLendon's actions in this matter were part of his discretionary governmental functions. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> Because there was no evidence that Chief McLendon acted maliciously, wilfully, or corruptly, the court did not err in granting summary judgment to him on the negligent hiring and retention claims. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Hollberg, Weaver &amp; Kytle, George M.

      Crook pleaded guilty to two counts of simple battery (merged) and one count of public indecency with respect to this incident. The court fined him $7,500 with $125 in surcharges and imposed 12 months probation for simple battery and 12 months consecutive probation for public indecency, plus $20 per month for probation supervision. Forty hours of community service and counseling for sexual behavior were special conditions of probation. We note that restitution to the victim could have been ordered. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/14/3/index.html">17-14-3</a></span>. This may have been the only achievable remedy against him for such a terrible ordeal at the hands of a public servant. The victim has medical expenses, not to mention the horror of the experience or the pain of memory. The legislature has "declared [it] to be the policy of this state that restitution to their victims by those found guilty of crimes is a primary concern of the criminal justice system." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/14/1/index.html">17-14-1</a></span>. Judges have the power to carry out this policy, to implement it, and to assure that it is given meaning in the lives of victims of crime.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
