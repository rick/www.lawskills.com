March 19, 1952.</div><div class="casepresiding">TOWNSEND, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Where, under a written contract for the sale of real estate signed by the prospective purchaser, seller, and real-estate broker, it is agreed that the broker is to hold earnest money paid in by the purchaser and dispose of it by turning part or all of it over to either the seller or purchaser according to certain contingencies, no definite time other than "a reasonable time" being named therein, the broker is a mere trustee or stakeholder as to the balance of such fund over and above his commission. For this reason, in an action by the seller to claim the surplus of the purchaser's earnest money as liquidated damages, the purchaser is a necessary party to the proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">Albert Lurz filed suit against John J. Thompson &amp; Company in the Civil Court of Fulton County on a contract which provides substantially that one Alvin Gross agrees to buy and the plaintiff agrees to sell, through the defendant as broker, certain described property. Seller agrees to furnish marketable title. Buyer has a reasonable time after acceptance to examine the title and furnish seller with a written statement of objections thereto, if any. Seller thereafter has a reasonable time to satisfy all valid objections and, if he fails to do so within a reasonable time, the contract shall be void at the option of the buyer. Buyer has advanced $1000 as earnest money, receipt of which is acknowledged by broker. In negotiating this contract the broker has rendered a valuable service, and is made a party hereto to enable him to enforce his commission when sale is consummated, and further agrees that if sale is not consummated due to his own default or failure to convey marketable title that seller shall pay full commission to broker and broker shall return earnest money to purchaser. If purchaser fails or refuses to consummate the transaction for any reason other than lack of marketable title in seller, purchaser will pay broker's commission and turn over the balance, if any, to the seller as liquidated damages if seller claims balance as his damages. Purchaser agrees that thereupon the broker is released from any and all liability for return of earnest money to purchaser. The petition alleges that the purchaser has failed and refused to consummate the transaction, although much more than a reasonable time has elapsed (namely, eight months); that plaintiff has now resold the property to another; that the obligation of the broker is a several obligation; that the buyer, Gross, is a non-resident of the State of Georgia and need not be joined as a party defendant. It is not alleged whether the buyer refused to purchase because of objections to the seller's title or for some other reason. Upon demurrer the trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that the money sought to be recovered does not, so far as the record discloses, belong to the,defendant absolutely, and it is not alleged that the defendant has done any act to divest the equitable title of Gross in the deposit. Exception is made to the judgment sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) Code  3-108 provides as follows: "As a general rule, the action on a contract, whether express or implied, or whether by parol or under seal, or of record, shall be brought in the name of the party in whom the legal interest in such contract is vested, and against the party who made it in person or by agent." The plaintiff seller and the non-resident purchaser are the prime contracting parties, the defendant being made a party for the purpose of protecting his commission and not because of any obligation or liability on his part. The sole question, therefore, is whether the seller may claim funds paid out by the purchaser and held by the broker as liquidated damages for the breach of the contract without joining the purchaser in such proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">Where a purchaser seeks to recover money advanced by him to a real-estate broker on the absolute condition that it be returned to him if the sale falls through, such purchaser may sue the broker directly without joining the seller. Kenney v. Walden, <span class="casemissing">28 Ga. App. 810 (1)</span> (113 S. E. 61). But a different case is presented where the broker holds the funds in trust and agrees to make disposition of them, as between adverse parties, in accordance with certain named contingencies, the occurrence of which might well be a matter of dispute between the parties having an interest in the fund. Where a proceeding presents for adjudication the ownership of described property within the jurisdiction of the court, all parties interested are necessary parties thereto. Faughnan v. Bashlor, <span class="casemissing">163 Ga. 525</span> (1 b) (136 S. E. 545); Firemen's Ins. Co. v. White, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 759 (2)</span> (184 S. E. 316). In Read v. Riddle, 48 N.J.L. 359 (7 Atl. 487), it was held that where money was paid to an agent under an agreement with his principal for the sale of real estate, upon the promise of the agent to return it in case it should turn out that the principal had not a good title, and the sale fell through because the principal did not have good title, an action would lie against the real-estate agent by the purchaser depositing the money. In Meecham, Agency (2d ed.), Vol. I,  1445, the following is stated: "Where an agent, who stands in the situation of a stakeholder, receives money to be paid over upon the happening of a certain contingency or the performance of given conditions, and pays it over before the happening of the contingency or the performance of the conditions, such payment will be no defense to an action by the party ultimately found to be entitled to receive the money."</div><div class="casepar">The petition here fails to allege the happening of the contingency, as it does not allege either that the purchaser made no valid objection to the title or that a marketable title was in fact furnished him, although it appears the property was subsequently sold to another. Nor is it alleged that the broker claims his commission from the earnest money in his possession and has thus himself elected to treat the default as that of the purchaser. Under the allegations of the petition his only interest in the contract at the time it was signed was to protect his right to commissions, and in consequence he was, as to the balance of the earnest money, a mere stakeholder or trustee, impartially holding the money to pay over to the person ultimately entitled thereto. On the issue of whether the seller is entitled to liquidated damages out of this fund the buyer is a necessary party under the terms of this contract, although no ruling is made as to the effect of a contract showing on its face (as, for example, by naming a date on which the rights of the parties would be resolved) that the party not joined had no further interest therein.</div><div class="casepar">The fund in question being in the hands of the defendant, and so within the jurisdiction of the court, and the plaintiff seeking no personal judgment against the non-resident, but only seeking to exclude him from any claim or interest, actual or contingent, to the balance of the fund, such non-resident may be served under the provisions of Chapter 81-2 of the Code of Georgia, and particularly Code  81-205 (6, 7) and 81-206. See Blount v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 301</span> (9 S. E. 2d, 65); Forrester v. Forrester, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 722</span> (118 S. E. 373); Faughnan v. Bashlor, supra.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in dismissing the petition for lack of a necessary party.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Gardner, P.
