Special ground 10 shows no cause for reversal, for the reasons set out in the body of the opinion.</div><div class="casepar">This is a bail-trover action. First, the petition alleged that C. F. Light (hereinafter called the defendant), of Fulton County, is in custody and control of property as follows: "One Spartan Royal Mansion Trailer Coach bearing number 33-51 3792 of the reasonable value of at least $5,500.00; one set of Nelson Dollies of the value of $125.00; and one awning of the value of $55.00. The above described property was picked up by the defendant in person on or about June 26, 1951 at the residence of the plaintiff on Gordon Road near Candlelight Inn in Cobb County, Georgia"--all of the value of $5680, to which property the plaintiff claims title or valuable interest therein, and the right to possession. Second, that the defendant refuses to deliver the property to the petitioner or to pay him the profits thereof. Third, the plaintiff, Smith, claims hire for said property of $50 per week since July 23, 1951.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant answered the petition substantially as follows: First, that until on or about July 21, 1951, he had the property which is described in the plaintiff's petition, and that he was holding it on consignment from the plaintiff. Second, that, on or about said date, the property was repossessed by one T. M. Hallam, Sales Manager of Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company of Columbus, Georgia, by reason of the fact that they were directed by the Spartan Trailer Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma, that the plaintiff was two or three payments in arrears on said trailer. Third, that the plaintiff had no right to consign the trailer and misrepresented the facts and warranted the title to be in him, when as a matter of fact he had no title to said trailer and no right to its possession, he having defaulted on the payments thereon, and the defendant had no right to refuse to turn over the trailer to the Joe Jones Trailer Company through the agent, T. M. Hallam. Fourth, that the defendant denies the reasonable market value of the trailer to be $5500, and tenders to the plaintiff one set of Nelson Dollies, the defendant claiming no right of title to them; the defendant denies the remaining portion of the plaintiff's petition except as otherwise herein stated, and denies the value of the hire of the trailer to be $50 per week. Fifth, the defendant says: "That he has failed to deliver the plaintiff's said property for the reasons above stated, that he does not have the plaintiff's alleged property and denies that said property has been concealed, or that he in any manner, caused the same to be moved away. This defendant alleges that the plaintiff bought said trailer from the Joe Jones Trailer Company originally under a conditional sales contract with the title to said property expressly remaining in the seller until all sums due under the said conditional sales contract were fully paid; the plaintiff agreeing that no transfer, renewal extension or assignment of this contract would release the plaintiff from his obligation to the seller, agreeing not to transfer any interest to said property without the seller's written consent. However, the said conditional sales contract was violated intentionally and willfully by the plaintiff."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff orally demurred and moved to strike paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the answer. The court sustained this motion to strike except as to paragraph 4, with leave to the defendant to amend. The defendant filed an amendment to his answer as follows: "1. By adding to paragraph 1 of said answer the following: 'A copy of said consignment agreement is attached hereto and made a part of this paragraph and answer.' 2. By striking from paragraph 2 of said answer the following: 'By reason of the fact that they were directed by the Spartan Trailer Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma that the plaintiff was two or three payments in arrears on said trailer' and by adding the following: 'By reason of the fact that said Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company was authorized by the Minnehoma Financial Company to repossess said trailer under the terms and conditions of a said conditional sale contract entered into between Joe Jones and the plaintiff herein, which conditional sale contract was transferred and assigned to the Minnehoma Financial Company. A copy of said sale contract is attached hereto and made a part of this answer, and paragraph. Defendant avers that the plaintiff herein was in default on the payments due in said conditional sale contract and that the terms of the said conditional sale contract were that under said conditional sale contract the seller had the right to repossess said trailer in case of default. Defendant avers that he did not deliver said trailer to said Hallam and did nothing affirmatively with respect to it, but that he did not physically restrain said Hallam from taking said trailer.' 3. By striking from paragraph 3 of his answer the following: 'And this defendant had no right to refuse to turn over the trailer to the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company through the agent, one T. M. Hallam.' 4. By adding to paragraph 5 of said answer the following: 'The conditional sale contract referred to herein is the same contract referred to in paragraph 2 hereof.' 5. By adding the following to be known as paragraph 6: 'Defendant denies paragraph 1 of the plaintiff's petition, and avers that at the time of the filing of said petition plaintiff did not have title or right of possession or a valuable interest in the trailer coach described in said petition.' 6. By adding the following to be known as paragraph 7: 'Defendant avers that as a part of said trailer consignment agreement, plaintiff agreed that the defendant assumed no responsibility for loss or damage to the trailer by fire, accident, or otherwise, and defendant avers that by virtue of said agreement this defendant is not responsible for the taking of the said trailer by said Hallam on basis of Joe Jones and the Minnehoma Financial Company.' 7. By adding the following paragraph to be known as paragraph 8: 'Defendant further avers that at the time of the bringing of this suit this defendant was not in possession of said property and did not have custody or control of said property, and that at no time mentioned in said suit did this defendant have custody, possession, or control of said property, it being placed on this defendant's sales lot in accordance with said consignment agreement.' "</div><div class="casepar">The court passed the following order with reference to said amendment to the answer: "Plaintiff renewing his motion to strike and objecting to the proffered amendment it is ordered that paragraph 1 is allowed: Paragraph 2 of the answer and of the amendment is stricken save that the language: 'Defendant avers that he did not deliver said trailer to said Hallam and did nothing affirmatively with respect to it, but that he did not physically restrain said Hallam from taking said trailer,' is allowed as paragraph 2 of the answer. Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the amendment are disallowed. This December 12th, 1951. [Signed] J. Wilson Parker, Judge, Civil Court of Fulton county."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed a second amendment to his answer as follows: "1. By adding a new paragraph to be known as paragraph nine reading as follows: 'Defendant avers that the said trailer was sold to plaintiff in accordance with a said conditional sale contract, copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof and on the 21st day of July, 1951, one T. M. Hallam, who was acting for Joe Jones, the conditional vendor in said contract, and the Minnehoma Financial Company, the transferee, of said contract, came to defendant and told defendant that said contract was in default and that he had come to repossess said trailer. At said time and place this defendant did not deliver said trailer to said Hallam and did nothing whatsoever affirmatively with respect to it, but he did not physically restrain said Hallam from taking said trailer and said Hallam did proceed to hitch onto said trailer and did pull it off to the lot of this defendant. Defendant avers that said conditional sale contract was, in fact, in default at said time. Defendant avers that as a consequence of the facts set out herein, he has committed no conversion of said property and at all times acted with due care and diligence.' 2. By adding a new paragraph to be known as paragraph ten and reading as follows: 'This defendant avers that he has done no act amounting to a conversion of the property set out in the plaintiff's petition and at all times has acted with due care and diligence with respect to said property.' "</div><div class="casepar">The court disallowed paragraph 1 and allowed paragraph 2 of the second amendment to the answer. The defendant filed exceptions pendente lite to the judgment disallowing the paragraphs mentioned in both his first and second amendment, and the plaintiff filed exceptions pendente lite to the order allowing the paragraphs specified above in the defendant's amendment. We will not include herein a copy of the rentention-of-title sales contract, since it is a standard sale contract, and we do not think it necessary for a determination of the case. We will, however, quote here a copy of what is designated as the Consignment Agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant: "Trailer Consignment Agreement: I, the undersigned, hereby agree to leave with C. F. Light Trailer Sales, for sale, for sixty days, my 1951 Model Royal Mansion Trailer Spartan, Serial Number 33-51 3792 . . . the asking price of my trailer, designated above, is $2,400.00, but will accept $2,400.00 net to me. And I, for myself, will warrant the said trailer unto the said C. F. Light Trailer Sales against any lawful claim and demand of all and every person or persons whatsoever. It is agreed that C. F. Light Trailer Sales, or his salesmen, assumes no responsibility for loss or damage to the trailer by fire, accident, or otherwise. Signed, this second day of July, 1951 at Atlanta, Georgia. Name: H. M. Smith; Address: Austell, R. F. D. 2; Telephone Number: Em. 2666."</div><div class="casepar">The case proceeded to trial. The evidence was substantially as follows: The plaintiff testified briefly and substantially, as far as it is necessary to determine the issues, that he had contact with the defendant with reference to selling the property in question, and the defendant stated, "I will be glad to bring it up here and sell it." The defendant was engaged in selling trailers. The plaintiff testified as to the value of the property in question and the hire for it. He further testified: that the defendant stated to him that it would take about sixty days for him to sell the property; that the plaintiff passed the defendant's place of business on the Bankhead Highway practically every day and observed his trailer until one morning he did not observe it; that he contacted the defendant and inquired of him if the defendant had sold the trailer, whereupon the defendant stated that he had not sold it, but that he had let a man from the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company carry it to Columbus, Georgia; that the defendant did not get the plaintiff's permission to do this, and the defendant did not give him any notice of it; that, when the plaintiff missed the trailer, that was the first time he knew what had become of the trailer; "I demanded the amount of money I was to get for the trailer, but he never paid it." On cross-examination the plaintiff testified substantially: that he did not purchase the trailer from the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company; that he purchased it in Atlanta from Mr. Jones through a Mr. Rice for $4790 in December 1950; that he did not pay cash, but there was a trade-in; that the plaintiff traded in another trailer and agreed to pay the balance over a period of five years; that, after purchasing the trailer, he took it to a trailer park on Stewart Avenue and from there to where he was building a house on Gordon Road, and he and his wife and son lived in it until he turned it over to Mr. Light, the defendant, to sell; that the plaintiff was one payment behind, the tenth payment; that he sent two payments in after July 3rd; that at the time he took out the bail-trover proceedings he knew the trailer was not at the defendant's place, but he didn't know where it was; that then it was that he found out from the defendant what became of the trailer. The plaintiff further testified on direct examination that the trailer was an aluminum trailer, and that they were no longer made, since aluminum has been diverted to the armed forces.</div><div class="casepar">Mr. King testified for the plaintiff substantially: that the trailer was kept on Gordon Road where the plaintiff built his home; that the witness last saw the trailer the day the defendant came and got it and moved it from the plaintiff's place; that the witness helped to connect it up; that the trailer was in good condition; that it was worth about $5750, judging from the condition it was in. Other testimony of the witness was regarding the value of the awnings and other property in the trailer.</div><div class="casepar">Lee Askew testified for the plaintiff substantially: that in the latter part of July, 1951, he was present at the time the plaintiff talked to the defendant, and he heard the plaintiff make demand upon the defendant for the trailer in question; that he had seen the trailer several times; that the plaintiff carried a written demand, and that before the written demand the plaintiff orally demanded the trailer back and asked for the other equipment; that the defendant gave him nothing, but told the plaintiff that the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company came and picked up the trailer without any court order or anything else; that the defendant did not explain to the plaintiff why the defendant had not notified the plaintiff, and stated that the defendant said in this connection that he didn't have anything to do with it. On cross-examination the same witness testified: that the witness read the written demand; that the plaintiff left it with the defendant; that he didn't know what became of it after the defendant got it; that the defendant said the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company came and picked up the trailer, and there was no court order presented; that the witness was there the whole time when the plaintiff was talking to the defendant, and the defendant had nothing to do with it whatsoever, and that he had no idea whatsoever as to why the trailer was picked up; that, if the defendant said anything to the plaintiff as to the fact that the plaintiff was behind in the payments, the witness didn't hear it.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant testified in his own behalf substantially as follows: that he operated a trailer court; that he and the plaintiff had a conversation with reference to the trailer in question, and the defendant went out and brought the trailer to his place of business; that they had a written agreement about the terms of the sale; that the trailer was taken in on a sixty-day consignment agreement; that, if the plaintiff picked it up before the expiration of the sixty days, there would be a pick-up charge on it; that this occurred about July 2nd; that Mr. Hallam came out to the place about July 21st; that Mr. Hallam worked for the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company and is Sales Manager for that concern; that Joe Jones is the owner of the Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company in Columbus, Georgia; that after Mr. Hallam came for the trailer, the defendant didn't do anything at all; that Mr. Hallam hooked onto the trailer and took it; that Mr. Hallam had a pick-up truck with a hitch on it; that he hooked the trailer to the pick-up truck and went on out; that the defendant was never able to sell the trailer; that Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company has never paid he defendant anything, and neither did Mr. Hallam pay him anything; that the defendant has not seen the trailer since and did not know what had happened to it; and that the defendant sells quite a few trailers. The witness then went into the price of trailers and his experience in dealing with them. He testified that the trailer in question was fairly good; that in the opinion of the witness it was worth approximately $3600 when Mr. Hallam pulled it away. On cross-examination the same witness testified that the plaintiff signed the consignment agreement in the presence of the defendant; that, according to the consignment agreement, the defendant took complete custody, control, and possession of the trailer in accordance with the terms of the consignment agreement; that the defendant did not turn the trailer over to Mr. Hallam; that the defendant did not see Mr. Hallam drive the trailer off. Then there followed testimony of the availability of trailers of like kind. On redirect examination the same witness testified that Mr. Hallam came out and picked up the trailer for Mr. Jones. Then the trailer consignment agreement was introduced.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial on the general grounds and thereafter added ten special grounds by amendment. The court granted the motion of the plaintiff for a new trial. This was the first grant of a new trial, and the defendant assigns error on this judgment granting a first new trial.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. Under this record the court did not abuse its discretion in the first grant of a new trial. The evidence did not in any view demand a verdict for the defendant. On the contrary we are inclined to think that the evidence demanded a finding in favor of the plaintiff except as to the value of the property involved and the hire thereof. We set out in the history of the case the petitions of the plaintiff and the answer of the defendant and also the motion to strike certain portions of the answer of the defendant and the judgment of the court thereon, and also the second amendment of the defendant to his answer and the judgment of the court thereon. We also called attention to the fact that the defendant excepted pendente lite to each ruling of the court dealing with the amendment to the answer. These exceptions pendente lite are set out in the bill of exceptions; and, since we are affirming the judgment of the court granting a first new trial, it becomes necessary that we pass upon these exceptions pendente lite. We have examined them and find that the court committed no reversible error in striking all of the amendments to the original answer as specified in the history of the case, and they are without merit because they seek to deraign the title of the plaintiff's principal by the agent defendant. We will deal with this principle hereinafter more fully, and we will deal with exceptions pendente lite of the defendant mentioned in his cross-bill of exceptions, based on the assignments of error of allegations in the amendments to the answer of the defendant which the court did not strike.</div><div class="casepar">2. The written consignment agreement was set out in full in stating the history of the case. That portion of the agreement, "It is agreed that C. F. Light Trailer Sales Company, or their salesmen assume no responsibility for loss or damage to the trailer by fire, accident, or otherwise," does not relieve the defendant under the facts of this case from liability. The words "or otherwise" are ejusdem generis, meaning a loss of the same kind or nature as "fire or accident." It does not serve as a specification which will free the defendant of standing idly and negligently by and permitting someone else to take the property bailed to him or consigned to him. Code  4-206 provides: "An agent may not dispute his principal's title except where legal proceedings, at the instance of others, shall have been commenced against him." There were no special proceedings here. In the defendant's allegations of his answer, he uses this language: "The defendant avers that he did nothing affirmatively with respect to it [the trailer] but that he did not physically restrain said Hallam from taking such trailer." He admits in this allegation that he did nothing, and in his testimony he admits nothing, Yet, in the agreement he was the agent of the plaintiff Smith to take the trailer and sell it. He was thereby obligated under the law to exercise diligence in the protection of the property while it was in his possession, custody, and control, from fire and accident or otherwise, and not to turn it over to some third person except under a legal procedure. There is much discussion pro and con, and numerous authorities cited as to the relationship existing between the parties. We think our statutory law covers the situation here as to the relationship, and we will cite no further authority. On this point, Code  4-101 reads: "The relation of principal and agent arises wherever one person, expressly or by implication, authorizes another to act for him, or subsequently ratifies the acts of another in his behalf." We might state here that the burden of proof after proof of loss of the property is on the bailee. Code  12-104 reads: "In all cases of bailment after proof of loss, the burden of proof is on the bailee to show proper diligence." He cannot exculpate himself from the liability of loss by alleging and proving that he did nothing affirmatively. The duty was on him to protect the property of his principal. He admits that he did nothing affirmatively. A case not altogether on all fours, but analogous to the situation here is Loeb v. Whitton, <span class="casemissing">77 Ga. App. 753</span> (49 S. E. 2d, 785). There the court stated: "The defendant here did too little and did that too late." In the case at bar, the defendant did nothing. He did not do even a little either soon or late.</div><div class="casepar">3. (a) We will now refer to the cross-bill of exceptions of the plaintiff. The first assignment of error therein is because the court erred in failing to strike paragraph 2 of the second amendment to the defendant's answer. In the history of the case we have quoted these paragraphs, but we think that the court did not err in failing to strike paragraph 2 of the second amendment.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The second assignment of error is because the court failed to strike paragraph 4 of the original answer, as shown in the history of the case. The court did not err in this regard.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The third assignment of error is because the court failed to direct a verdict except as to the value and hire of the property in question. We think that the court erred in this regard. Under the whole evidence this was the only issue raised legally, and this was all that should have been submitted to the jury.</div><div class="casepar">4. We move next to a consideration of the special grounds and amended motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Special ground 1 assigns error because the court charged the jury in effect that the consignment contract relieved the defendant of all negligence that does not amount to willfulness or wantonness. We think that this was reversible error, and the true rule is that the defendant was bound to use ordinary diligence.</div><div class="casepar">(b, c) The jurors were brought into the courtroom. A juror stated to the court that a question had come up in regard to the consignment agreement as to the meaning of the phrase that the defendant assumed no responsibility for the trailer by fire, accident, or otherwise. The court stated in effect that, if the jury found that there had been a conversion, then the jury should find for the plaintiff as to the property which had been consigned regardless of the agreement. The juror then further inquired: "Does the agreement supersede an act of converting?" The court answered in the negative and stated that, if there had been a conversion, the paper is no protection. The latter part of the court's charge is not erroneous, under the facts of this case.</div><div class="casepar">5. (a) Special ground 2 assigns error because the court charged that the burden of proof in the case was on the plaintiff Smith to prove by a legal preponderance his right to recover. This might be confusing. After proof of loss of the bailed property by the plaintiff, the burden was on the defendant to show proper diligence on his part.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Special ground 3 assigns error because the court overruled the motion for a directed verdict for the defendant. This same assignment of error was made in the cross-bill and will not be dealt with further here.</div><div class="casepar">6. Special grounds 4, 5, and 6 all deal with the admission of evidence over objection of counsel for the plaintiff. The evidence had to do mainly with the conduct of Hallam, as agent, for Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company in obtaining the trailer from the defendant. It negatives any idea of any legal proceedings to obtain possession of the trailer, and sought to excuse the defendant from protecting the property as bailed. This evidence was irrelevant, immaterial, prejudicial, and harmful to the plaintiff, in that it sought to set up for the defendant a defense not permitted under the law. The court erred in allowing such evidence over objection.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Special ground 8 assigns error because the court admitted over objection of the defendant, the consignment agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant. We think that this was admissible and no reversible error appears here.</div><div class="casepar">8. Special ground 9 assigns error because the court admitted, over objection, a telegram that Hallam, the agent of Joe Jones Trailer Sales Company, came to Atlanta and informed the defendant of the default in payment due, and demanded and took the trailer. We think that this evidence was wholly inadmissible. It seems that it was an agreement concerning the telegram, but it seems not to have been an agreement other than that the defendant might offer the telegram in evidence subject to objection, and let the court pass on its admissibility. The court should not have admitted the telegram, over objections, and it was error to do so.</div><div class="casepar">9. Special ground 10 assigns error because of certain arguments and colloquy between counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for the defendant, had with the court concerning the telegram mentioned above. The question seems to have been as to whether counsel for the plaintiff admitted the contents of the telegram as a fact, or whether counsel for the plaintiff admitted that Hallam would testify to the contents of the telegram if he were present. Our view is that it was immaterial whether it was admitted as a fact or otherwise. It was wholly without the range of any issue in the case and was incompetent in view of what we have already said above.</div><div class="casepar">The Court Finds: (1) The first grant of a new trial by the lower court is affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">(2) The rulings striking the pleadings of the defendant in his original answer and in his first and second amendment on which assignments of error are made are affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">(3) The assignments of error in the cross-bill of exceptions are affirmed in part, and reversed in part, as shown in the body of the opinion.</div><div class="casepar">(4) Let the issue of said case on resubmission to a jury be confined to the value of the property and the value of the hire thereof.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">G.
