The trial court granted the Howells' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, Hayes challenges the constitutionality of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1), first enacted in 1975. Ga. L. 1975, p. 725.</div><div class="casepar">On January 2, 1957, James A. Hayes, Jr., deeded three tracts of land to W. Harvey Howell "reserving and excepting unto the said James A. Hayes the undivided one-half of all minerals and oil rights in and to the three tracts of land hereinabove described and conveyed."</div><div class="casepar">On December 21, 1966, W. Harvey Howell deeded to two other Howells the three tracts of land (minus eleven acres reserved for himself) with the following provision: "There is reserved and excepted from this conveyance the undivided one-half of all minerals and oil rights in and to the three tracts of land hereinabove described and conveyed, which were excepted by James A. Hayes in his deed to W. Harvey Howell The Howells will be referred to herein as the landowners and Hayes will be referred to as the mineral owner.</div><div class="casepar">The parties agree that the mineral rights have never been taxed apart from the land, and that the mineral owner has never paid taxes on his mineral rights. For the past twenty-five years, the landowners have paid all taxes, and the mineral owner has made no attempt to exploit the mineral rights.</div><div class="casepar">The landowners rely upon OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann. 85-407.1) which provides in part: ". . . whenever real property is conveyed in fee simple but the mineral rights to such property are reserved by the grantor, the owner of the real property in fee simple . . . may gain title to such mineral rights by adverse possession if the owner of the mineral rights . . . [has] neither worked nor attempted to work the mineral rights nor paid any taxes on them for a period of seven years since the date of the conveyance . . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168(b)</a></span> (1) (Code Ann.  85-407.1) provides that the petition shall be brought in the county where the land is located.</div><div class="casepar">The mineral owner alleges that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1) is contrary to the venue requirements of the Constitution of Georgia and is unconstitutional as a retroactive law and an impairment of the obligation of contract. He further contends that the landowners' payment of taxes inures to his benefit as co-tenant of the mineral interests.</div><div class="casepar">1. The mineral owner argues that venue was improper in Bartow County, the county in which the land lies (1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. II, Par. II (Code Ann.  2-2802)), and that suit should have been brought in Fulton County, where he resides (1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. II, Par. III (Code Ann.  2-2803)). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> In so arguing, he relies on the emphasized language from White v. Gordon, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../178/04/index.html">213 Ga. 730</a></span>, 731 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../178/04/index.html">101 SE2d 759</a></span>) (1958): "Our law makes a distinction between suits to establish the title to land or to establish the evidence of title, and suits to recover the land upon legal title, the former being suits in equity and the latter actions at law. The above-quoted constitutional provision [providing that cases respecting title to land shall be tried in the county where the land lies] concerns actions at law, such as ejectment and statutory substitutes, in which the plaintiff asserts a presently enforceable legal title against the possession of the defendant, for the recovery of land or recovery of the land and mesne profits. Owenby v. Stancil, <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 50</span>, 55 (<span class="casemissing">8 SE2d 7</span>) [1950]. 'One test as to whether a suit to recover land is one of ejectment simply, and is a case "respecting title to land," is whether the plaintiff can recover on his title alone, or whether he must ask the aid of a court of equity in order to recover.' Frazier v. Broyles, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 642</span>, 646 (<span class="casemissing">89 SE 743</span>) [1916]." (Emphasis supplied.) The mineral owner contends that since the landowners' case depends, not on the strength of their own title, but upon proof of his failure to work his mineral rights or to pay taxes on them for seven years, in order to acquire ("gain," "obtain") title under the statute, the suit is one in equity "to establish the title to the land or to establish evidence of title" and should have been filed in Fulton County. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">The landowners' suit is clearly not in equity as they seek to establish legal title by adverse possession as a matter of law in reliance on the statute. In this substantive decision, no equity is involved. No deed to the mineral owner is to be cancelled. The landowners seek to recover an interest in land by asserting a presently enforceable legal title against the defendant's mineral interest claim. Therefore, under the White v. Gordon, supra, rule, as a case at law, venue is constitutionally in the county in which the land lies as provided in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (b) (1) (Code Ann.  85-407.1).</div><div class="casepar">This result is not changed by the fact that this suit was brought as a declaratory judgment action. In Shaw v. Crawford, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../194/11/index.html">207 Ga. 67 (60 SE2d 143) (1950)</a></span>, a declaratory judgment action involving competing chains of title for the same property, we held that where the primary and fundamental issue is legal in character, i.e., that of title to land, the venue of the case is still in the county where the land lies even though the suit is for declaratory judgment and an incidental injunction may issue to preserve the status quo. Compare Vizard v. Moody, <span class="casemissing">115 Ga. 491 (1) (41 SE 997) (1902)</span>, predating the Declaratory Judgment Act.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the case on the ground of improper venue.</div><div class="casepar">2. In 1957, when the mineral owner created his undivided one-half interest in the mineral rights by reservation, the law was that such mineral rights could not be lost by mere non-user. In Brooke v. Dellinger, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 66</span>, 73 (<span class="casemissing">17 SE2d 178</span>) (1941), it was held that mineral rights conveyed in fee simple could not be lost by adverse possession absent adverse use of the minerals themselves.</div><div class="casepar">By enacting OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1), the General Assembly attempted to abrogate the Brooke rule by providing that either non-user or failure to pay taxes on the mineral rights could result in a forfeiture after seven years if an appropriate action is brought by the owner of the remaining fee after that time. This statute was ameliorated by our holding in Nelson v. Bloodworth, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../103/43/index.html">238 Ga. 264 (232 SE2d 547) (1977)</a></span>, that suit cannot be brought under the 1975 act until seven years after its effective date (July 1, 1975). Accord, Johnson v. Bodkin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../952/1/index.html">241 Ga. 336 (247 SE2d 764) (1978)</a></span>. See Stith v. Morris, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../948/9/index.html">241 Ga. 247 (1) (244 SE2d 817) (1978)</a></span>; U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Toombs County, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 544 (4) (1 SE2d 411) (1939)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Here, the seven years have passed since enactment of the 1975 law (now OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1)). But, because the rights were retained by the mineral owner prior to 1975, he contends that application of the act would violate the state constitutional prohibition against impairment of the obligation of contracts and passage of retrospective laws. "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or laws impairing the obligation of contract or making irrevocable grant of special privileges or immunities shall be passed." 1983 Ga. Const., Art. I, Sec. I, Par. X (Code Ann.  2-110).</div><div class="casepar">a. In Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U. S. 516 (102 SC 781, 70 LE2d 738) (1982), the United States Supreme Court recently addressed an impairment of contracts claim under the federal constitution regarding Indiana's Dormant Mineral Interest Act. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Under Indiana's law, a severed mineral interest not "used" for 20 years automatically lapses and reverts to the surface owner unless a claim is filed with the county recorder's office prior to the end of the 20-year period (or a two-year grace period after the effective date of the statute). "Uses" include mining attempts, payment of rents or royalties, and payment of taxes. After recognizing the power of a state to define property rights and to condition the retention of those rights upon reasonable requirements, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> the Supreme Court held that since "a mineral owner may safeguard any contractual obligations or rights by filing a statement of claim in the county recorder's office [, s]uch a minimal 'burden' on contractual obligations is not beyond the scope of permissible state action." Id. at p. 531.</div><div class="casepar">The same is true here. The preservation of the mineral owner's claim under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1) depended only upon his use of the minerals or upon returning them for taxes. We find that, as under the federal constitutional provision, the minimal burden imposed by this statute of either using the minerals or returning them for taxes does not impair the contractual obligations involved as prohibited by the comparable provision of our state constitution. The mineral owner's contractual rights are not unconstitutionally impaired by the addition of minimal conditions imposed by the state for retaining those interests. As long as the conditions are met, the rights are the same; failure to comply with the regulatory conditions results in loss of the rights. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> The trial court did not err in overruling the mineral owner's objection to granting summary judgment on this basis.</div><div class="casepar">b. Unlike the federal constitution, our state constitution protects not only against the impairment of contracts, but also against retroactive (or retrospective) laws. This provision prohibits the impairment of vested rights. "To be vested, in its accurate legal sense, a right must be complete and consummated, and one of which the person to whom it belongs cannot be divested without his consent. A divestible right is never, in a strict sense, a vested right." Merchants Bank v. Garrard, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 867</span>, 871 (<span class="casemissing">124 SE 715</span>) (1924). It has also been said that: "[t]he term 'vested rights,' which cannot be interfered with by retrospective laws, means interests which it is proper for [the] state to recognize and protect and of which [the] individual cannot be deprived arbitrarily without injustice." American States Water Service Co. of California v. Johnson, 88 P2d 770, 774 (Cal. 1939). Accord, Keller v. Wilson &amp; Co., 190 A 115, 122 (Del. 1936); Board of Commrs. of Everglades Drainage Dist. v. Forbes Pioneer Boat Line, 86 S 199, 202 (Fla. 1920); Rookledge v. Garwood, 65 NW2d 785, 791 (Mich. 1954); Application of Filippini, 202 P2d 535, 537 (Nev. 1949); Troy Hills Village, Inc. v. Fischler, 301 A2d 177, 181 (N. J. 1971).</div><div class="casepar">Mineral rights are valuable property interests recognized and protected in this state. Brooke v. Dellinger, supra, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 66</span>. As such, owners of mineral interests may be said to have "vested rights" in this property. The mineral owner therefore claims a "vested right" to retain his mineral interests against a claim of adverse possession under the state of the law at the time of his contract as held in Brooke v. Dellinger, supra, and that to apply the statute to his rights is a retrospective law in contravention of his state constitutional rights.</div><div class="casepar">It is clear, however, that property is held subject to the proper exercise of the police power by legislative bodies. "The general rule throughout the United States is that a State legislature may constitutionally repeal, alter, or modify State laws enacted under the police power for the protection of the public, without violating any express or implied constitutional prohibition against retroactive statutes." Bullard v. Ho]man, <span class="casemissing">184 Ga. 788</span>, 792 (<span class="casemissing">193 SE 586</span>) (1937). For example, in Morgan v. Thomas, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../196/00/index.html">207 Ga. 660 (3) (63 SE2d 659) (1951)</a></span>, this court held that when the Fulton County Board of Commissioners changed the zoning in an area which included the appellant's land, no vested right in the zoning was abridged.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore as we stated in Pope v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../923/3/index.html">242 Ga. 331</a></span>, 333-34 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../923/3/index.html">249 SE2d 16</a></span>) (1978), upholding the constitutionality of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, "[t]he inherent police power of the state extends to the protection of lives, health and property of the citizen, and to the preservation of good order and public morals and is not subject to any definite limitations, but is coextensive with the necessities of the case and the safeguard of public interest. McCoy v. Sanders, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../649/48/index.html">113 Ga. App. 565 (148 SE2d 902) (1966)</a></span>. Further, in the area of environmental legislation, the state Constitution specifically authorizes the General Assembly 'to provide [by law for: (1)] restrictions upon land use in order to protect and preserve the natural resources, environment and vital areas of this state.' " (Emphasis supplied.) 1983 Ga. Const., Art. III, Sec. VI, Par. 11 (a) (1) (Code Ann.  2-1102). Other examples of burdens which may be imposed upon property rights under the police power are health regulations, Vinson v. Home Builders Assn., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../120/52/index.html">233 Ga. 948</a></span>, 949 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../120/52/index.html">213 SE2d 890</a></span>) (1975); building standards, Reed v. White, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/84/index.html">207 Ga. 623</a></span>, 625 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/84/index.html">63 SE2d 597</a></span>) (1951); and abatement of nuisances, Davis v. Stark, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 223</span>, 230 (<span class="casemissing">31 SE2d 592</span>) (1944).</div><div class="casepar">3. In enumeration of error 3, the mineral owner argues that under the facts of this case the landowners, as tenants in common of the mineral interests, have paid the taxes due from the mineral owner, and hence the taxes on the mineral interests have been paid. See Bank of Tupelo v. Collier, <span class="casemissing">191 Ga. 852</span>, 857 (<span class="casemissing">14 SE2d 59</span>) (1941). The mineral owner relies on the fiduciary relationship between tenants in common. Fuller v.

As we read OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/5/168/index.html">44-5-168</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-407.1), it contemplates payment of taxes upon the mineral rights, as such, by the holder of the mineral rights who is not the owner of real property in fee simple. Having failed to make such payments, the mineral owner is not entitled to claim the benefit of tax payments made by the landowners.</div><div class="casepar">Archer &amp; Elsey, Shepherd L.

      1983 Ga. Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. II, Par. 11 (Code Ann.  2-2802) provides: "Cases respecting title to land shall be tried in the county where the land lies . . . ." 1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. II, Par. III (Code Ann.  2-2803) states: "Equity cases shall be tried in the county where a defendant resides against whom substantial relief is prayed."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Art. I, Sec. X of the United States Constitution (Code Ann.  1-134) provides: "No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility." (Emphasis supplied.) The phrase "ex post facto" applies to criminal, not civil, cases. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. (3 U. S.) 386, 390 (1798); Bankers Trust Co. v. Blodgett, 260 U. S. 647, 652 (43 SC 233, 67 LE 439) (1922); Boston v.

      In so holding, the Court relied inter alia on Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. (28 U. S.) 280 (1830), where it upheld a recording statute as applied retroactively to a senior deed not required to be recorded when delivered, in favor of a junior deed that had been recorded.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      It could be urged that the landowners owe no contractual obligations to the mineral owner, and that the mineral owner's rights are property rights, not contractual ones. In view of the foregoing discussion, we need not pursue this matter.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
      It is for this reason that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/6/123/index.html">44-6-123</a></span> (Code Ann.  85-1005) is not applicable here.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Hatcher, Irvin &amp; Pressley, Henry M.
