Gordon Superior Court. Before Judge Pope.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">These consolidated appeals are brought by the Tax Commissioners of Gordon and Murray Counties from the dismissal of their respective complaints for declaratory judgment authorizing the foreclosure of tax liens against property owned by an insolvent Arizona insurer. We conclude that because the insurer is presently in receivership proceedings, the Georgia Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/1/index.html">33-37-1</a></span> et seq., prohibits the Tax Commissioners from foreclosing against the property to collect delinquent taxes. Therefore, we affirm.</div><div class="casepar">Appellee Farm &amp; Home Life Insurance Company ("FHLIC") owns property located in Gordon County, and holds a security interest in properties located in Gordon and Murray Counties. FHLIC is domiciled in Maricopa County, Arizona. On September 5, 1990, delinquency proceedings were instituted against FHLIC by the Arizona Department of Insurance, pursuant to that state's adoption of the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat.,  20-611 et seq. A receivership order was entered by the Superior Court of Maricopa County, placing FHLIC under the control of a receiver and deputy receiver (collectively "the Receiver"), who were ordered to take exclusive control of FHLIC's assets. The receivership order specifically enjoined creditors from enforcing claims against FHLIC's assets without first obtaining permission from the receivership court.</div><div class="casepar">In 1996, the Tax Commissioners of Gordon and Murray Counties ("the Tax Commissioners") announced an intention to seek and levy executions against the property located in their respective counties in order to collect delinquent ad valorem taxes owed by FHLIC. In response, the Receiver recorded the receivership order with the clerk of the Murray and Gordon County Superior Courts. The Receiver then filed an action in the Maricopa County Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that, before taking any action as a creditor of FHLIC against the Gordon and Murray County properties, the Tax Commissioners first must submit their claims to the Receiver and establish the claims in the Arizona receivership action. The Tax Commissioners responded by challenging the personal jurisdiction of the Arizona court, and filed motions to dismiss FHLIC's action. Those motions were denied.</div><div class="casepar">While the Tax Commissioners' motions to dismiss were pending before the Arizona court, they filed separate complaints against the Receiver in the Gordon and Murray County superior courts, seeking declaratory judgments that under Georgia law, they were authorized to pursue and foreclose tax liens against FHLIC's property. FHLIC entered a special appearance and answered, arguing inter alia that the Gordon and Murray County properties were under the exclusive control of the Arizona receivership court, and that the receivership order was entitled both to reciprocal enforcement and full faith and credit in Georgia. Both the Gordon and Murray County superior courts concluded that the Georgia Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act ("GIRLA"), OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/1/index.html">33-37-1</a></span> et seq., prevented the Tax Commissioners from foreclosing tax liens against the properties. The Tax Commissioners then brought these consolidated appeals.</div><div class="casepar">1. Whether officers of Gordon and Murray Counties may, due to a receivership proceeding in another state, be prevented from foreclosing tax liens against properties located within their counties in order to collect ad valorem property taxes is, of course, a question of Georgia law. The General Assembly has anticipated this question, and the difficulties it raises, and provided for their resolution in GIRLA.</div><div class="casepar">GIRLA addresses problems relative to the forced liquidation and rehabilitation of insurance companies doing business in Georgia that have assets and liabilities distributed in more than one state. It is intended to lessen those problems (1) "by facilitating cooperation between states in the liquidation process and by extending the scope of personal jurisdiction over debtors of the insurer outside [of Georgia]," <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> and (2) by providing "a comprehensive scheme for the rehabilitation and liquidation of insurance companies." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Georgia and Arizona are two of many states that have substantially adopted the Uniform Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act. The Arizona act is, in all material respects, substantially similar to GIRLA in its treatment of insurers, claimants, assets, debts, and priorities.</div><div class="casepar">It follows under Georgia law that the Arizona Receiver in this matter is vested with title to all of FHLIC's property, including the properties located in Gordon and Murray Counties. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Furthermore, GIRLA provides that because no ancillary receiver has been appointed in Georgia to assist the Arizona Receiver in handling FHLIC's assets, all Georgia claimants against FHLIC are required to file their claims with the Arizona Receiver. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Most importantly, GIRLA expressly provides that:</div><div class="casepar">During the pendency in this or any other state of a liquidation proceeding, whether called by that name or not, no action or proceeding in the nature of an attachment, garnishment, or levy of execution shall be commenced or maintained in this state against the delinquent insurer or its assets. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">This language is clear and susceptible of only one meaning -- because a receivership proceeding is pending against FHLIC in Arizona, the Tax Commissioners' attempts to utilize Georgia's courts to levy and foreclose a lien against FHLIC's Georgia property is prohibited by Georgia statute. Accordingly, by virtue of the plain language of the Georgia Code, the Gordon and Murray County superior courts properly dismissed the Tax Commissioners' complaints.</div><div class="casepar">2. The Tax Commissioners argue that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span>'s prohibition of the levy and execution of tax liens against property located in Georgia and owned by FHLIC is an unconstitutional attempt to exclude property located in this state from ad valorem taxation with-</div><div class="casepar">domiciliary, reciprocal insurer's title to property, is the substantial equivalent of ARS  20-625 (B); (3) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/52/index.html">33-37-52</a></span>, concerning the Insurance Commissioner's possible appointment as ancillary receiver for a non-domiciliary insurer, is the substantial equivalent of ARS  20-625; (4) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/54/index.html">33-37-54</a></span>, concerning a non-resident's rights against a domiciliary insurer, is the substantial equivalent of ARS  20-626; (5) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/55/index.html">33-37-55</a></span>, concerning the rights of resident claimants in reciprocal states against non-domiciliary insurers, is the substantial equivalent of ARS  20-627; and (6) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span>, concerning the stay of actions during the pendency of liquidation proceedings, is the substantial equivalent of ARS  20-630.</div><div class="casepar">out specific authorization. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> According to the Tax Commissioners, section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> is tantamount to granting a tax exemption for foreign insurers in receivership proceedings, contrary to the provisions of the Georgia Constitution.</div><div class="casepar">We disagree with this assessment of the statute. Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> does not state that the property of an insolvent, non-domiciliary insurer is exempt from taxation. Rather, it grants such insurers a stay in proceedings against them to collect amounts owed, much like the stay found in the Federal Bankruptcy Code. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Because the protections afforded by federal bankruptcy laws are not available to insurance companies, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> they must seek liquidation in a state receivership action, and a central forum is necessary for the orderly liquidation of an insolvent insurer's assets. Otherwise, creditors of an insolvent insurance company will race to their respective state forums in an effort to be among the first to levy against the insurer's assets located in that state, to the great detriment of innocent policyholders who might be unaware that their interests are being usurped. To protect against such chaos, GIRLA (like the model act upon which it is based) fosters cooperation among reciprocal states by designating the domiciliary state, where the receivership is pending, as the proper forum for filing claims and determining priorities among creditors. This is not only a desirable goal, it is indispensable to avoid the contradictory judgments from multiple jurisdictions that would otherwise result.</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to the Tax Commissioners' characterization of the statute, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> does not exempt FHLIC's Georgia property holdings from ad valorem taxation; it only stays actions to collect such taxes once they become due by foreclosing a lien against the property, without first obtaining permission to do so from the receivership court. The statute does not prohibit the Tax Commissioners from assessing ad valorem taxes against FHLIC, and seeking distribution from the Receiver. To alleviate the Tax Commissioners' concern that their interests might not be fully considered by the Arizona receivership court, GIRLA empowers the Georgia Commissioner of Insurance to appoint an ancillary receiver in this state to aid and assist the Arizona Receiver. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> While section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> does change the remedies available to the Tax Commissioners, and cause the Commissioners obvious inconvenience, it does not violate the constitutional prohibition against exempting property from ad valorem taxation.</div><div class="casepar">3. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> does not impermissibly conflict with the constitutional jurisdiction of Georgia's superior courts. The General Assembly's authority to enact section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span>, and all of GIRLA, is found in the constitutional mandate that "provision shall be made by law for the regulation of insurance." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> The Superior Courts are, of course, constitutionally given jurisdiction over, "all cases, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> Thus, the Constitution recognizes that there may be necessary and appropriate exceptions to the superior courts' grant of general jurisdiction. Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span> is such an authorized exception, the basis for which is found in Art. III, Sec. VIII, Par. I of our Georgia Constitution.</div><div class="casepar">4. The Tax Commissioners claim that the Arizona receivership court lacked both in rem subject matter and personal jurisdiction to enjoin Georgia creditors from enforcing claims against FHLIC's assets in this state without first obtaining permission from the receivership court. We need not resolve this argument, however, because it is irrelevant to the issues being decided in this appeal. The decisions being appealed in this matter were rendered by the Gordon and Murray County superior courts, both of which are located in Georgia. Regardless of whether the Arizona court properly exercised its jurisdiction when issuing its injunctive order, there can be no dispute that the Georgia superior courts properly exercised both in rem subject matter jurisdiction over the properties at issue and personal jurisdiction over the Tax Commissioners. As explained in Division 1, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/37/56/index.html">33-37-56</a></span>, the Tax Commissioners are prohibited from filing and foreclosing tax liens against FHLIC's Georgia properties so long as the company is in receivership proceedings in Arizona. The Gordon and Murray County superior courts properly relied upon this Georgia Code section in dismissing the Commissioners' respective complaints for declaratory relief. In no respect are the superior courts' decisions dependent upon the Arizona Courts' injunctive order; rather, they rest entirely upon GIRLA's mandate staying all foreclosure actions in this state against insurers in receivership proceedings in other states. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> Accordingly, even if the Arizona court's jurisdiction was lacking in this matter, and we draw no such conclusion here, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> the Georgia courts' decisions must stand, as a matter of Georgia law decided by Georgia courts.</div><div class="casepar">Thurbert E.
