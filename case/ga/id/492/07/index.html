Lee and Beverly Lee (appellants) was made under the provisions of the GILA." The petition further alleged that appellants had asserted the promissory note to be null and void and had "demanded, pursuant to the provisions of Ga. Code Ann.  109A-9--404 and Ga. Code Ann.  67-2902, the release of [appellants] and the cancellation of said Promissory Note within the time periods established by said provisions of law, otherwise [appellants] would seek the sanctions therein provided, including monetary penalties and attorneys' fees." On these allegations Beneficial prayed "[t]hat the Court enter a Declaratory Judgment in favor of [Beneficial] declaring that said Promissory Note is valid and enforceable under the laws of Georgia, including the [GILA]."</div><div class="casepar">Appellants answered the petition and denied Beneficial's allegation that it was licensed under the GILA. The answer admitted, however, the allegation concerning appellants' assertion that the note was null and void.</div><div class="casepar">The case then proceeded to the discovery stage and, subsequently, both parties moved for summary judgment. A hearing was held and the trial court granted Beneficial's motion and denied the motion filed on behalf of appellants.

Appellants, on the other hand, contend that the loan fee should have been calculated in the following manner:</div><div class="casepar">FAC under  25-315 (a) $2961.29 FAC under  25-315 (b) $2818.84</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2218.84 88.75</div><div class="casepar">Loan Fee under  25-315 (b) $136.75</div><div class="casepar">See Shelley v. Liberty Loan Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/27/index.html">153 Ga. App. 47</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">The meaning of FAC as that phrase is used in Code Ann.  25-315 (b) relating to the loan fee was first specifically addressed in Consolidated Credit Corp. v. Peppers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/35/index.html">144 Ga. App. 401 (240 SE2d 922) (1977)</a></span>. It was there held that FAC has the same meaning in both subsections (a) and (b) of Code Ann.  25-315, "the amount necessary for a borrower to borrow in order to obtain the amount desired." Peppers, 144 Ga. App. at 404, supra. FAC in  25-315 (b) as thus defined will equal the total payback figure of the loan " 'only for discount loans [repayable in 18 months or less], in which both principal and interest are borrowed. For nondiscount loans, the interest itself is not borrowed, and thus the "amount borrowed" equals the total payback figure minus interest . . . "[A]mount borrowed" seems especially suitable as the computational base for the loan fee, since this fee is a front-end charge for making the loan . . . and thus relates to the amount of money originally considered as "borrowed," rather than the amount of money that is ultimately paid back.' " Peppers, 144 Ga. App. at 403, supra. It is thus readily seen that whether a constituent element of the final payback figure is an element of FAC defined in Peppers as the "amount borrowed" is determined by whether that element is "discounted" or deducted in advance. " '[A] discount . . . means, . . ., a deduction or drawback made upon . . . advances or loans of money, upon negotiable paper, or other evidences of debt, payable at a future day . . .' " Cooper v. National Bank, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 356</span>, 361 (<span class="casemissing">94 SE 611</span>) (1917). Therefore, if interest on a GILA loan of 18 months or less is discounted or deducted in advance and it therefore becomes necessary for the debtor to "borrow" the discounted interest in order to obtain the total amount he desires in hand, the amount of that discounted interest becomes an element of the computational FAC base from which the interest under Code Ann.  25-315 (a), Robbins v. Welfare Fin. Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../693/23/index.html">95 Ga. App. 90 (96 SE2d 892) (1957)</a></span>, and the loan fee under Code Ann.  25-315 (b) are derived. Peppers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/35/index.html">144 Ga. App. 401</a></span>, supra. On the other hand, interest on a GILA loan of greater than 18 months is not discounted and it is therefore not necessary for the debtor to borrow the nondiscounted interest in order to obtain the amount he desires in hand; thus, the amount of that nondiscounted interest does not become an element of the computational FAC base from which either the interest, McDonald v. G. A. C. Finance Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../642/74/index.html">115 Ga. App. 361 (2) (154 SE2d 825) (1967)</a></span>, or the loan fee is calculated. Peppers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/35/index.html">144 Ga. App. 401</a></span>, supra. Carter v. Swift Loan &amp; Fin. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../534/52/index.html">148 Ga. App. 358</a></span>, supra, stands for the proposition that the maintenance charge under Code Ann.  25-315 (e) "for each month in the term of the loan contract" is not a discountable element which can be deducted in advance so as to constitute an amount which the debtor has to borrow in order to obtain the amount he desires in hand and, therefore, it does not become an element of the computational FAC base. A review of the case law demonstrates therefore that FAC may be determined by adding together the amounts of all the constituent discounted elements that the debtor must borrow in order to have the amount he desires in hand or, assuming all elements have been calculated properly, by taking the final payback figure and subtracting therefrom the amount of all the nondiscounted elements.</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2218.84 88.75 Since it was necessary to borrow $136.75 to pay the loan fee on $2818.84, this amount must be added to the $2818.84 constant to determine the total amount it was necessary to borrow and the calculations then made on the resulting $2955.59 sum:</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2355.59 94.22</div><div class="casepar">Total Loan Fee on $2818.84 + App.) APRIL TERM, 1981. 209</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2361.06 94.44</div><div class="casepar">Total Loan Fee on $2818.84 </div><div class="casepar">+ $142.22 Loan Fee "borrowed"</div><div class="casepar">to pay the Again, $142.44 "borrowed" to pay the loan fee added to $2818.84 totals $2961.28 and using this figure in the formula gives the following result:</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2361.28 94.45 Further calculations demonstrate that $142.45 is the maximum amount it was necessary for appellants to borrow in order to pay the loan fee on $2818.84, for when that amount is added to $2818.84, the calculations on the resulting $2961.29 figure are:</div><div class="casepar">4% of $2361.29 94.45</div><div class="casepar">Total Loan Fee on $2818.84 Thus it was necessary for appellants to borrow a total of $142.45 to pay the loan fee on $2818.84--$136.75 to pay the loan fee on the original $2818.84 and $5.70 to pay the loan fees on the successive amounts it was necessary for appellants to borrow in order to pay the loan fees on the original $136.75 loan fee:</div><div class="casepar">4% Loan Fee on $136.75</div><div class="casepar">borrowed to pay 4% Loan Fee on $5.47 borrowed </div><div class="casepar">to pay 4% Loan Fee on $.22 </div><div class="casepar">borrowed to pay Total Loan Fee on amount</div><div class="casepar">Since appellants were required to borrow a total of $142.45 to pay the loan fee on the original $2818.84 that it was necessary to borrow in order to obtain the amount desired in hand and since the $142.45 loan fee was itself a discountable "front-end" charge, the FAC or the entire amount appellants had to borrow to obtain their desired figure was $2961.29. Interest calculated on this FAC under Code Ann.  25-315 (a) equals $710.71. The loan fee calculated on this FAC under Code Ann.  25-315 (b) equals $142.45. This is exactly what appellants were charged by Beneficial. The same result is reached in the instant case if FAC is defined as the final payback figure less all the nondiscounted elements of the loan:</div><div class="casepar">Interest - 710.71 Maintenance Charge - 72.00</div><div class="casepar">As demonstrated, the loan fee on $2961.29 is $142.45. It follows that the loan fee charged the borrowers was derived from the correct FAC computational base, the total amount of money "borrowed" from Beneficial.</div><div class="casepar">This brings us to Shelley v. Liberty Loan Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/27/index.html">153 Ga. App. 47</a></span>, supra, relied upon by appellants. It was there held: "[T]he loan prepaid finance charge fee authorized by Code Ann.  25-315 (b) . . . is $94.08 derived from a computational base of $1,752. This was not the correct computational base, however, as it included the $94.08 fee. The correct base should have been $1,657.92 for which a prepaid finance charge of only $90.32 was authorized. 'Including the interest in the computational base used to calculate the loan fee resulted in a fee in excess of that permitted by the Industrial Loan Act.' [ Peppers, supra.]" Shelley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/27/index.html">153 Ga. App. 47</a></span>, 48, supra.</div><div class="casepar">We believe the holding in Shelley was correct and that the loan fee was derived from an excessive FAC computational base in violation of Peppers. However, we do not agree with Shelley insofar as it reasons that under Peppers the correct FAC should be derived by subtracting the amount of the loan fee from the final payback figure. Peppers clearly stands for the proposition that inclusion of nondiscountable interest in the FAC computational base results in an excessive loan fee. The error in Shelley was in equating the discountable loan fee, which represents an amount the debtor must "borrow" to obtain the amount he desires, with the nondiscountable interest in Peppers. Therefore, the loan fee in Shelley was excessive under Peppers because it was calculated from a FAC computational base which included interest and not because the FAC base included the amount of the loan fee itself. As we have demonstrated above, the amount of the loan fee is an amount which the debtor must borrow to obtain the sum he desires and, under Peppers, is included in the definition of FAC under both subsections (a) and (b) of Code Ann.  25-315.</div><div class="casepar">If Shelley and appellants were correct and the total amount of the loan fee should not be included in the computational FAC base for calculating the fee under subsection (b) of Code Ann.  25-315, it would have the "anomalous" result, specifically disapproved in Peppers, "of assigning two different values to the FAC in the same note." Peppers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/35/index.html">144 Ga. App. 401</a></span>, 404, supra. This result would follow from Shelley's and appellants' reasoning because while the total amount of the loan fee would not be included in FAC under subsection (b) of Code Ann.  25-315, that amount apparently would be included in the computational FAC base of subsection (a) from which the interest is derived. "Since the lender is entitled to his fees for making the loan, and does not receive them at that time, but by means of installment payments during the [term of the loan], he is entitled to charge interest thereon." Robbins v. Welfare Fin. Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../693/23/index.html">95 Ga. App. 90</a></span>, 95, supra. Thus if Peppers and Robbins are correct then under both subsection (a), dealing with interest, and subsection (b) dealing with the loan fee, FAC is the same figure, the total amount it is necessary that the debtor borrow. If Peppers and Robbins are wrong and Shelley and appellants are correct, FAC is not the same computational base under both subsections and does not represent "the amount it is necessary to borrow to secure the amount desired by the borrower." Peppers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/35/index.html">144 Ga. App. 401</a></span>, 403, supra. It is our conclusion that Peppers and Robbins are correct and FAC is the same computational base under both subsections and represents the entire amount borrowed, including all discounted elements of the underlying loan.</div><div class="casepar">In Financeamerica Corp. v. Drake, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../514/87/index.html">154 Ga. App. 811 (270 SE2d 449) (1980)</a></span>, the holding in Peppers, though limited in application, was specifically ratified while Shelley was specifically overruled insofar as the "retroactive application of Peppers was used as the basis for holding the contract 'null and void.' " Financeamerica, 154 Ga. App. at 819, supra. Accordingly, we find it necessary to say in the instant case only that the reasoning underlying the holding in Shelley is hereby overruled and will no longer be followed insofar as it conflicts with Peppers' definition of FAC. It was, therefore, not error for any reason urged on appeal to declare the note in the instant case to be a "valid" GILA obligation.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is next urged that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because Beneficial "failed to prove proper license under Ga. Code Ann.  25-301 et seq. at the time the loan was made." Beneficial, while conceding that the record is devoid of evidence of its licensure at the relevant time, urges that such evidence was unnecessary in the context of a declaratory judgment action which seeks a mere determination of the underlying enforceability of a promissory note rather than the actual enforcement of that note.</div><div class="casepar">"In cases of actual controversy the respective superior courts of the State of Georgia shall have power upon petition, or other appropriate pleading, to declare rights, and other legal relations of any interested party petitioning for such declaration, whether or not future relief is or could be prayed, and such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree . . ." Code Ann.  110-1101 (a). "A declaratory judgment or decree is one which simply declares the rights of the parties or expresses the opinion of the court on a question of law, without ordering anything to be done; its distinctive characteristic being that the declaration stands by itself, and no executory process follows as of course; and the action is therefore distinguished from other actions in that it does not seek execution or performance from the defendant or opposing party." Clein v. Kaplan, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 396</span>, 403 (<span class="casemissing">40 SE2d 133</span>) (1946). "[S]uch rulings, . . ., have the force and effect of a judgment or decree, and as such, and to such extent, are binding on all of the parties." Shippen v. Folsom, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 58</span>, 60 (7) (<span class="casemissing">35 SE2d 915</span>) (1945). Applying the above stated principles to the instant case, it appears that the grant of summary judgment had the force and effect of declaring that the appellants' promissory note, governed by the GILA, was "enforceable" against them by Beneficial. Or, stated in the converse, the order in this case declared Beneficial's right to enforce a contract governed under the GILA. The order did not merely determine that the promissory note was enforceable, it also declared that it was enforceable by Beneficial. Actual enforcement in behalf of Beneficial was not ordered only because Beneficial did not also seek this relief but contented itself with a mere indication of its right to do so.</div><div class="casepar">Obviously before a party is entitled to actual enforcement of an obligation, that party must have the underlying right to enforce it. When the obligation in issue is one governed under the GILA, there must be proof that "the obligee in the note sued upon was duly licensed at the time the obligation was incurred. [Cits.]" Household Finance Corp. v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../628/74/index.html">119 Ga. App. 49 (165 SE2d 864) (1969)</a></span>. (Emphasis supplied.) In its petition for declaratory judgment, Beneficial made an allegation of its right to enforce the note in the instant case. Appellants, however, denied this allegation in their answer and Beneficial's right to enforce the note was thereby put into issue. Although Beneficial showed that it was licensed under the GILA in 1980, it did not submit evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment to prove that it was so licensed in 1979 when the note was executed by appellants. It is thus clear that the issue of Beneficial's underlying entitlement to enforce the note under the GILA remains unresolved. Scoggins v. Whitfield Finance Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../926/7/index.html">242 Ga. 416 (249 SE2d 222) (1978)</a></span>. Absent evidence of its licensure, Beneficial was not entitled to a declaration of its right to enforce the note. Appellants' obligation on the note was "conditional upon the fact of license at the time it was incurred, and [Beneficial's] right to enforce it [was] conditional upon a showing of that fact, the burden being upon [it]. [Cit.]" (Emphasis supplied.) Bayne v. Sun Finance Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../644/62/index.html">114 Ga. App. 27</a></span>, 28 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../644/62/index.html">150 SE2d 311</a></span>) (1966). There was no burden on appellants to disprove licensing. Rather, the burden of proving licensing was on Beneficial. It is, therefore, of no aid to Beneficial on appeal that appellants did not raise the issue of GILA licensing in the trial court. They denied Beneficial's licensing in their answer and the burden was then on Beneficial to prove its right to enforce a GILA obligation. There being a genuine issue of material fact as to Beneficial's licensure at the time the obligation was incurred, it was error to grant summary judgment in favor of Beneficial's right to enforce the note.
