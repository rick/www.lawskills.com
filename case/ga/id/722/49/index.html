The law does not afford relief to one sui juris who suffers by not using the ordinary means of information, whether his neglect is due to indifference or to credulity.</div><div class="casepar">2. The petition, seeking to recover because of the alleged fraudulent and grossly negligent conduct of the defendant insurance company in placing in the hands of a named person certain communications, which were thereafter exhibited to the plaintiff, an operator of a hospital, with knowledge that they might be submitted to the plaintiff and relied upon by him in connection with hospitalization and treatment of the insured, and alleging that they caused him to believe that the patient was insured at the time of his injury on February 26, 1949, and to render medical and hospitalization service in the amount of $1184, liability for which the defendant insurance company is estopped to deny by reason of its conduct, did not set forth a cause of action against the defendant as the communications, shown by exhibits attached to the petition, did not purport to state that the patient was insured on February 26, 1949, the date of his injury, even if the defendant could in any wise be said to be estopped to deny any statement made in the communications, and the plaintiff, presumably sui juris, could, by proper investigation, have readily determined that the insurance was not in effect prior to March 2, 1949, and his misfortune is shown to have been caused by his own credulity. The court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the action.</div><div class="casepar">E. E. Moseley, doing business as Moseley Clinic and Hospital, operating a general hospital at Donaldsonville, Georgia, filed in the Superior Court of Seminole County a petition against Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Association to recover $1184, together with expenses and attorney's fees by reason of the following facts: On February 26, 1949, one Thomas J. Swain was admitted to the plaintiff's hospital and clinic, suffering from very serious injuries which he had sustained in a fall from an upstairs window. Upon being admitted, the patient's wife exhibited to the plaintiff receipts upon the printed receipt forms of the defendant evidencing the payment of premiums on medical and hospital insurance by the said Swain to the defendant. Within approximately five days after he was admitted to the hospital, on or about March 2, 1949, there was delivered to the plaintiff, either by Mr. Swain or his wife, a printed statement from the defendant, further purporting to show that he was covered with insurance by the defendant. This statement is attached to the petition as Exhibit "A" and made a part thereof. The exhibit reads as follows: "Dear Friend: You're safe now. For you have bought good protection. Almost two million thoughtful people believe it is the best there is, but you bought more than a policy--you bought service. After all, about all any insurance policy is, is a contract to give you service when you need it. We maintain 153 offices all over the country just for that purpose. When you move, your protection moves with you. And remember, we make no charge for service or for handling claims. Now your protection covers almost everything, but you should read it to find out just what it will do. It's all there--so if you'll read it, I'm sure you'll know just exactly how fine it is. It will be a pleasure to see that our service is completely satisfactory to you. Your protection, like any other insurance, is good only when it is in force. Play safe Keep your protection paid a year in advance. We want you to avoid what has happened to some folks. They became sick or were injured--maybe didn't get well--and the protection had lapsed. We don't want that to happen to you. . . . When you want information, just fill in and mail the enclosed postage paid card, and we'll give you full details without cost or obligation. Cordially yours, [signed] P. O. Priss, President." Along with the statement were two "membership cards" evidencing the fact that the said Thomas J. Swain had been issued policies numbers 76686-49M and 76702-49M by the defendant. Subsequently, on March 5, 1949, there was delivered to the plaintiff a copy of a report to the defendant, advising it of the injuries on February 26, 1949, of its insured Thomas J. Swain, and that he was hospitalized in the plaintiff's hospital. This document was attached to the petition as Exhibit "B" and made a part thereof. The exhibit purports to be a copy of a letter dated Donaldsonville, Georgia, March 5, 1949, to Roy P. Morgan, Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Ins. Co., Atlanta, Georgia, signed by Mrs. Thomas J. Swain, and reading as follows: "This is to inform you that my husband, Thomas J. Swain, is hospitalized in the Moseley Clinic and Hospital, Donaldsonville, Georgia, having fallen from a window in the hotel on February 26, 1949, and sus-</div><div class="casepar">tained a fracture of his right arm, right thigh and ankle. He is insured with your company and his policy No. is 76686-49M. He is not able to sign his name because of the injury to his right arm and I am executing this report to you." Thereafter, on or about March 10th, there was delivered to the plaintiff a statement signed by Roy Morgan, State Manager of the defendant, along with forms for submitting proof of loss after the said Thomas J. Swain should have been released from the hospital. This paper was attached as Exhibit "C" and made a part of the petition and read as follows: "The enclosed form is to be used in submitting proof of loss in connection with your claim under the hospitalization policy which you hold with the Association. After you have been released from the hospital we ask that you and your physician complete the attached proof form in detail, sign and return to this office with receipted bill or bills marked paid for your hospital expense and other incidentals covered by this policy. . . . It is our desire to dispose of your claim with the least inconvenience to you, and we shall endeavor to take some action as promptly as possible. Assuring you of our desire to be of the best of service at all times, we are, Sincerely, [signed]."</div><div class="casepar">Upon the basis of the showing as hereinabove set out, the plaintiff and his associates on the hospital staff rendered to the said Thomas J. Swain the very best medical and hospital service for a period of 71 days, which was of the reasonable value of $1184, and upon the release of the patient from the hospital the plaintiff prepared, on forms provided by the defendant, proof of loss and itemized bill for service as requested in Exhibit "C," forwarded the same on May 9, 1949, to the defendant, together with an assignment from Thomas J. Swain of his benefits under the said policies, numbered as above set out, requesting that payment be made directly to the plaintiff. Therefore, relying upon representations of the defendant that the said Swain was covered with insurance by it, the petitioner rendered the services to and unconditionally released the said patient from his hospital without asking or receiving any other or further security for the payment of the medical and hospital expense incurred. Hearing nothing from the defendant, the plaintiff on May 24, 1949, wrote the defendant requesting immediate attention to the matter, a copy of the letter being attached to the petition as Exhibit "D." On May 27th the defendant mailed to the plaintiff a letter disclaiming liability, which was the first intimation the plaintiff had from any source whatever that the said Swain was not covered by medical and hospital insurance by the defendant. A copy of the letter is attached to the petition as Exhibit "E." The defendant was grossly negligent in putting into the custody of the said Swain the documents shown by Exhibits "A" and "C," which being submitted to the plaintiff led him to believe that the said defendant was carrying medical and hospital insurance upon the patient and out of which the plaintiff would be compensated for the services rendered. The defendant is equitably estopped from denying liability for such medical and hospital expense, and, further, he has acted in bad faith in connection with the transaction out of which this cause of action arises and should also be required to pay attorney's fees for the bringing of this suit, which the plaintiff alleges is at least $300, and whatever additional expense is incurred by the plaintiff incident to the said suit. The plaintiff alleges, upon information and belief, that both the said Swain and his wife actually believed that he was covered by insurance with the defendant, and in presenting the said documents to the defendant were acting in good faith, not intending to perpetrate a fraud upon the plaintiff, but it is specifically charged that the defendant, acting through its servants, agents and employees did cause a fraud to be perpetrated upon the plaintiff in negligently and carelessly putting into their custody the documents shown by Exhibits "A" and "C," with knowledge that they might be submitted to the plaintiff and relied upon by him in connection with hospitalization and treatment of the said Swain, the defendant then and there well knowing that the policies of insurance which had been theretofore issued to the said Swain were not in effect on February 26, 1949, the date of his injuries. The failure of the defendant to advise the plaintiff immediately upon receipt of the notice from Mrs. Swain, as set out in Exhibit "A," that the policies antedated the injury, and therefore the medical and hospital expense would not be covered by the said insurance constitutes gross negligence upon the part of the defendant as to be a fraud upon the plaintiff. Both Thomas J. Swain and his wife are insolvent, and a suit</div><div class="casepar">against either or both of them would avail the plaintiff nothing. Being aware of their financial condition, had it not been for the fact that the defendant had caused him to believe that his services were covered by the insurance, the plaintiff would have required the said Swain to obtain funds and pay for the services or to provide him with security in some manner in satisfaction of his bill for such services before being discharged from the hospital. The provisions of the two policies of insurance herein mentioned specifically covered every item included in the bill for services submitted to the defendant along with the proof of loss hereinabove mentioned, and on account of the negligent conduct herein complained of the defendant should be required to pay the full amount thereof, together with expenses and attorney's fees expended in connection with the collection thereof. The prayers were for process and judgment.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant demurred generally on the following grounds: 1. The petition sets forth no cause of action against the defendant. 2. It fails to show any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant and fails to allege any duty or any circumstances under which a duty would arise requiring the defendant to inform the plaintiff of its relationship with Thomas H. Swain. 3. It fails to show any privity of contract or any duty owing the plaintiff by the defendant giving rise to a cause of action. 4. It fails to allege that the so-called representations of the defendant were wilful and with knowledge. 5. It does not allege that the plaintiff made any effort to determine whether or not the policy covered the injuries and does not allege that he did not have an opportunity to read the policy, and further shows on its face that the plaintiff made no effort to determine whether or not the injuries were covered by the policy. 6. The petition shows in paragraph 13 that the said Swain and his wife were insolvent, and that, therefore, the actions or representations of the defendant, if any, could not possibly have injured the plaintiff. 7. It fails to show any right to rely upon the representations or actions of the defendant and it shows upon its face that the loss, if any, by the plaintiff was occasioned by his own neglect, carelessness and failure to inquire as to the terms of the policy. 8. It fails to allege that the plaintiff had no opportunity to learn the true terms of the policy. 9. It shows on its face that if the alleged actions and representations of the defendant amounted to anything it was a promise to be fulfilled in the future and upon which an action sounding in tort will not lie.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant also demurred on numerous special grounds.</div><div class="casepar">The court, without passing upon the special grounds, sustained the general demurrer, and the exception here is to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) The petition shows no contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant insurance company. The plaintiff's theory of recovery seems to be that the company, by placing in the hands of the patient certain documents and being reasonably bound to anticipate that they might be exhibited to the plaintiff, is estopped to deny that it had issued an insurance policy which would cover the medical and hospitalization expense here involved and is liable therefor. It is apparent that in fact the patient was not protected by any policy as of the date of his injury on February 26, 1949, but it is asserted in the brief of counsel for the plaintiff in error that when the company wrote the patient, on some undisclosed date, that he was protected by insurance, and on March 9, 1949, the State manager requested the submission of proof of loss upon the dismissal of the patient from the hospital, the patient was supplied with the means of innocently deceiving the plaintiff and the company is now estopped to deny liability as for a fraud. Assuming but not conceding, and without reference to the legal principle that estoppel does not of itself create liability, that the insurance company would in any wise be estopped by reason of its alleged conduct, certainly the estoppel would not operate as to any facts not disclosed by the communications. What do the documents relied upon purport to show? The statement delivered to the plaintiff on March 2, 1949, does not carry with it any assurance to the patient that the protection referred to therein was in force at the time of the patient's injury on February 26, 1949, and, consequently, as to that communication the insurance company would not be estopped from contending that the insurance was not in force until March 2, 1949. In fact, the statement to the insured as to coverage was accompanied by the warning to anyone who might read that "you should read it [the policy, which the petition shows was not in force on February 26, 1949] to find out just what it will do. . . . Your protection, like any other insurance, is good only when it is in force." Thus it is evident that the company was not representing that the insured was protected even before the effective date of the policy. Thereafter, on March 5, 1949, the wife of the patient wrote, not to the company at its home office, but to the Georgia State manager of the company, advising him that the insured had been injured on February 26, 1949, and was in the hospital of the plaintiff, and that he held policy No. 76686-49M. This did not impose any obligation beyond the policy which was not in effect until March 2, 1949. Thereafter, on or about March 10, 1949, there was delivered to the plaintiff a letter which had been addressed on March 9, 1949, by the State manager of the company to the patient, enclosing proofs of loss to be submitted by him after his discharge from the hospital. This letter, though inviting the submission of a claim, did not commit the insurance company to any obligation to pay it, and should not have caused any careful reader to entertain that idea and be misled. The most that was said as to the invited claim was that "we shall endeavor to take some action as promptly as possible." (Italics ours.) The company was thus left in a position to pay or to refuse to pay the claim, according to its conclusions upon its merits, subject, of course, to the right of the insured to have his claim adjudicated in a court of law. There is nothing in any of the documents which could cause a careful reader to conclude that the company would in all events pay a claim, under a policy dated March 2, 1949, for an injury which occurred on February 26, 1949. The alleged innocence of the patient or his wife in submitting the documents to the plaintiff under the impression that he was covered by insurance for the injury sustained can not relieve the plaintiff from ascertaining for himself the effective date of the policy. In Marietta Fertilizer Co. v. Beckwith, <span class="casemissing">4 Ga. App. 245</span>, 249 (61 S. E. 149), in dealing with the question of fraud in a contract of sale, this court said: "These general principles relating to the subject of fraud are to be construed, of course, in connection with the general rule, equally well estab-</div><div class="casepar">lished, that the law does not afford relief to one who suffers by not using the ordinary means of information, whether his neglect is due to indifference or to credulity. When the means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both parties, and the subject of purchase is alike open to their inspection, if the purchaser does not avail himself of these means he will not be heard to say, in impeachment of the contract of sale, that he was deceived by the vendor's representations." See also Miller v. Roberts, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 511 (2)</span> (71 S. E. 927); Rutland v. Parham, <span class="casemissing">32 Ga. App. 662 (1)</span> (124 S. E. 355); Sawyer v. Birrick, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 746</span>, 747 (127 S. E. 806). The principle of law above stated is applicable here. The plaintiff, in so far as the petition shows, might easily have apprised himself of the fact that the policy did not purport to cover any injury sustained on February 26, 1949, and it is evident that his misfortune was caused by his own credulity. Indeed, the petition does not allege that the communications were intended for the plaintiff, and in such a case "If one acts on representations not made to him and not intended by the declarant for him, he will do so at his own risk. Such declarations do not operate as an estoppel against the declarant." Parker v. Crosby, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 1</span> (102 S. E. 446). To the same effect see Randolph v. Merchants &amp;c. Loan Co., <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 671</span>, 676 (183 S. E. 801); Dingfelder v. Georgia Peach Growers Ex., <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 521</span>, 522 (2) (186 S. E. 425). Manifestly, the petition did not set out a cause of action, and the court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the action.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
