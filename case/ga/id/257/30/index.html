Cherokee Superior Court. Before Judge Mills.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs Sam S. Hause and Bob D. Hause, doing business as Hause Brothers, filed a verified complaint on account against Cherokee County, demanding to be paid "for services rendered to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department for towing and storage services." The judgment of the trial court is affirmed because it did not err in granting judgment in favor of the Hause brothers for vehicle storage fees at the rate of $10 per day for one year.</div><div class="casepar">1. First, some preliminary matters with respect to the particulars of the case and the procedure followed to this point.</div><div class="casepar">The order appealed from denied the defendant county's motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiff Hause brothers' motion for summary judgment but limited the recovery of storage fees to one year's worth due to the restriction contained in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/11/1/index.html">36-11-1</a></span> and did not award towing fees, as they pre-dated the year period. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> A direct appeal was taken by the county, which is the correct procedure whether the order is a final or a partial judgment. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (h). Plaintiffs did not file a cross-appeal from the rulings adverse to them. See Southeast Ceramics v. Klem, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../795/1/index.html">246 Ga. 294</a></span>, 295-296 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../795/1/index.html">271 SE2d 199</a></span>) (1980); Seaboard Coast Line R. v. Mobil Chem. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../442/68/index.html">172 Ga. App. 543</a></span>, 544 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../442/68/index.html">323 SE2d 849</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">After the notice of appeal was filed, the court ruled on defendant's "motion for reconsideration" and plaintiffs' "motion for clarification" of the appealed order. In ruling on these motions, the court expressly granted only partial summary judgment, having concluded that certain matters required an evidentiary determination, and it denied summary judgment as to them. This order is not on appeal and is void, as the court lost jurisdiction of the case when the notice of appeal was filed a week earlier. State v. Ganong, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../277/56/index.html">221 Ga. App. 250</a></span>, 251 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../277/56/index.html">470 SE2d 794</a></span>) (1996); see Costanzo v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/63/index.html">200 Ga. App. 806</a></span>, 811 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/63/index.html">409 SE2d 686</a></span>) (1991) (damages ruling subsequent to notice of appeal cannot be considered on appeal). Because the order is void, the county's amendment to its notice of appeal to include this order is of no effect.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, the only issue on appeal, subsumed in the three enumerations of error, is whether the plaintiffs have a valid claim against the county.</div><div class="casepar">2. The undisputed facts which led to the lawsuit began on January 4, 1992, when a deputy sheriff at the direction of the sheriff informed the plaintiffs that a search warrant was about to be executed so that their towing and storage services were needed by the county for the items to be seized. Plaintiffs operated an approved wrecker service pursuant to Cherokee County Code  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/20/index.html">3-25-20</a></span> et seq. (enacted by County Ordinance 91-74). They provided the service requested, transporting some 23 items including vehicles, trailers, and a boat to their lot as required by Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/30/index.html">3-25-30</a></span>. Some of the items were returned to insurance companies and true owners, who paid the fees. Others were returned, pursuant to court order, to the person whose premises were searched, after he pleaded guilty to certain offenses. The County paid the towing and storage fees for these vehicles.</div><div class="casepar">At that time the plaintiffs submitted to the county an invoice for the rest of the items still remaining on their lot. Because it was substantial, the chief deputy was dispatched to seek an adjustment, and plaintiffs agreed to submit instead an invoice for one-half of the statutory fee. In response they were informed that the county budget could not accommodate the bill, and it was not paid, unlike all the others submitted and paid during the course of 35 years during which plaintiffs provided 24-hour wrecker service to Cherokee County. After their demand letter was ignored, they filed this suit.</div><div class="casepar">The complaint is based on the obligation created by the ordinance for the services requested and performed, Number 91-14 (Cherokee County Code  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/20/index.html">3-25-20</a></span> et seq.). Plaintiffs did not seek recovery on a theory of quantum meruit as an alternative, as well they could not, for quantum meruit "is not available when a county is the defendant." PMS Constr. Co. v. DeKalb County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../910/8/index.html">243 Ga. 870</a></span>, 872 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../910/8/index.html">257 SE2d 285</a></span>) (1979). Compare Walston &amp; Assoc. v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../269/73/index.html">224 Ga. App. 482</a></span>, 483 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../269/73/index.html">480 SE2d 917</a></span>) (1997) (quantum meruit is available against a municipality). Restitution is available as a remedy against a county, PMS Constr. Co., 243 Ga. at 872, but plaintiffs did not seek that here. They sought to recover on a commercial account, with interest pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/7/4/16/index.html">7-4-16</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/10/1/index.html">36-10-1</a></span> requires that "[a]ll contracts entered into by the county governing authority with other persons in behalf of the county shall be in writing and entered on its minutes."</div><div class="casepar">Beacham, <span class="casemissing">189 Ga. 304</span>, 305-306 (<span class="casemissing">5 SE2d 775</span>) (1939): "This law is designed to keep the public's business open to inspection. The legislature, in the exercise of an indisputable right, has provided that there can be no enforceable contract with such county officers unless it be in writing and recorded on the minutes of such officers. In the light of this law, no one can seriously contend that the plaintiff has entered into a legal contract with the county officers and is entitled to the benefits of such alleged contract, unless there has been a full compliance with the requirement of the Code. Any negotiations or oral agreements, or even written agreements that have not been entered on the minutes, fall short of being valid contracts conferring any right upon such party, and will not constitute a basis for an action against the county. These essential requirements of a valid contract with the county cannot be waived. The mandate of this law is absolute and applicable to each and every contract made and executed on behalf of the county; and to be valid and enforceable every contract must conform to these essential requirements."</div><div class="casepar">There is in the record no contract in writing between the county and the Hause brothers entered on the minutes of the county commission. In fact, there appears to be no contract in writing at all. Without both, a contract is unenforceable. Floyd v. Thomas, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../184/09/index.html">211 Ga. 656 (87 SE2d 846) (1955)</a></span>, illustrates this. So do Hatcher v. Hancock County Commrs. &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../998/9/index.html">239 Ga. 229 (236 SE2d 577) (1977)</a></span>, and Merk v. DeKalb County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../263/38/index.html">226 Ga. App. 191</a></span>, 192 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../263/38/index.html">486 SE2d 66</a></span>) (1997) (Merk's "sole cause of action [was] breach of contract" although it "actually sounds in tort"). Although a contract may consist of multiple documents, see B&amp;C Tire &amp;c. v. Cooper Tire &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/24/index.html">212 Ga. App. 228</a></span>, 229 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/24/index.html">441 SE2d 468</a></span>) (1994), and Bd. of Regents &amp;c. v. Tyson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../366/8/index.html">261 Ga. 368</a></span>, 369 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../366/8/index.html">404 SE2d 557</a></span>) (1991), the combination of (i) the ordinance, (ii) the Hause brothers' approved application as a wrecker service, and (iii) their inclusion on the "approved list" maintained in the sheriff's office would not fit the statute because, even if these jointly constituted a contract, the parts were not all entered on the minutes. And procedurally, the approved application and the approved list are not in the record and so are missing ingredients for summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">But plaintiffs base their claim on the ordinance itself, which was passed pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/60/4/index.html">36-60-4</a></span>. The ordinance provides in Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/30/index.html">3-25-30</a></span> that "[w]hen specifically directed to do so by the Sheriff's Office, the wrecker service shall hold vehicles for evidence, confiscation or any other purpose permitted by law" and, upon proper authorization of the Sheriff's Office, shall release any vehicle. The ordinance also sets the rate schedule for the fees which the approved wrecker service is entitled to when it performs a task described in the ordinance. Varying amounts are set for towing, and the daily storage charge beginning after the third day the vehicle is stored is $10.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, the action is based not "on contract" but on a "right to [fees] as fixed by or in pursuance of law." Graham v. Beacham, supra, 189 Ga. at 306, made this distinction and cited three illustrative cases. In all three, the County was obligated to pay for services set forth by law. See Culberson v. Watkins, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 185 (1) (119 SE 319) (1923)</span> (salary recoverable from county because fixed by law); Sammons v. Glascock County, supra (salary of county commissioner of roads and revenues is provided by law rather than contract); Walker v. Stephens, <span class="casemissing">175 Ga. 405 (1)</span> (a) (<span class="casemissing">165 SE 99</span>) (1932) (appointment of county attorney and his right to salary rest on law, not on contract).</div><div class="casepar">The same is the case here. Regarding this particular assignment involving the removal and safe storage of items seized from the criminal defendant's premises, the sheriff and the plaintiffs were doing what the county commissioners required them to do by the express terms of the law adopted by the county commission to effectuate the services the county needed to carry out its law enforcement duties in the exercise of its police power. Had the Hause brothers refused the assignment and not performed the services required by the sheriff, they would have been in violation of Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/30/index.html">3-25-30</a></span> of the ordinance. The plaintiffs, who provided that wrecker service, are entitled to be paid the fees expressly provided by that same ordinance.</div><div class="casepar">If the county is not obligated by the ordinance to pay for the services required by it, then neither are those private persons who seek return of their property after law enforcement officers seize it and assign physical custody of it to the wrecker services. And if the county is not obligated to pay for the services which were rendered on this occasion, then its payments over 35 years have been illegal, an outcome the county does not even suggest. Shannondoah, Inc. v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../563/81/index.html">140 Ga. App. 200</a></span>, 202-203 (<span class="casemissing">230 SE2d 351</span>) (1976), discusses the distinction between an unenforceable contract and an illegal one. See Overlin v. Boyd, 598 F2d 423, 424, n. 1 (5th Cir. 1979). If the plaintiffs' right of recovery had been based on contract, then its absence from the minutes (which is undisputed) and its nonexistence in writing (should that be the case) would render past payment of the County-established fees possibly illegal. Compare Floyd v. Thomas, supra, 211 Ga. at 656 (contract with county not in writing and not on minutes is illegal) with City of Atlanta v. North by Northwest &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../339/9/index.html">262 Ga. 531</a></span>, 539-540 (7) (c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../339/9/index.html">422 SE2d 651</a></span>) (1992) (procedural irregularities do not render county contract ultra vires). But the claim is founded on a right to payment expressly created by county ordinance.</div><div class="casepar">The order of the trial court is affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">MCMURRAY, Presiding Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent. In my view, however much we sympathize with the plaintiffs, we are not authorized to affirm the judgment enforcing against the defendant County a claim based on a contract which is not spread upon the minutes of the County's proceedings.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs Sam S. Hause and Bob D. Hause, doing business as Hause Brothers, brought this verified "COMPLAINT ON ACCOUNT" against defendant Cherokee County, Georgia ("the County"), demanding to be paid "for services rendered to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department for towing and storage services. . . ." Certain "vehicles [were] in the possession of Plaintiff [sic] under the direction of the Sheriff's Department for the purpose of impound and storage with expenses accruing thereon daily" The complaint also alleged the County acted in bad faith in refusing to pay and demanded interest due on a commercial account under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/7/4/16/index.html">7-4-16</a></span>. By amendment, plaintiffs alleged that the County still refused to pay, after plaintiffs agreed to a 50 percent reduction in the amount claimed as storage, despite a county ordinance authorizing a daily storage rate at $10 per day per item stored. Plaintiffs demanded $153,620 as the principal sum.</div><div class="casepar">The County denied the material allegations, and subsequently moved to dismiss the action because the agreement was not in writing. Meanwhile, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. After hearing both motions, the trial court ruled that the 12-month limitation period established at OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/11/1/index.html">36-11-1</a></span> barred collection of any amounts accruing before February 3, 1994, but held the County liable despite the absence of a written agreement, reasoning that since the contract for services was completed by plaintiffs, the instant lawsuit "concerns not so much enforcement of a contract, but collection of an acknowledged debt. To hold otherwise would make it impossible for a county to obtain services without providing a written contract in advance." In a subsequent order, the trial court granted plaintiff judgment in the principal amount of $42,900.</div><div class="casepar">"All contracts entered into by the county governing authority with other persons in behalf of the county shall be in writing and entered on its minutes." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/10/1/index.html">36-10-1</a></span>. "Oral contracts on behalf of a county have repeatedly been held to be void[.]" City of Warrenton v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../113/42/index.html">235 Ga. 665</a></span>, 666 (<span class="casemissing">221 SE2d 249</span>). "A mere oral agreement is unenforceable even though it be embodied or recited in a resolution adopted by the county commissioners and entered on the minutes." Murray County v. Pickering, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. App. 739 (1) (157 SE 343)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">The Cherokee County Wrecker ordinance defines an approved wrecker service as: "Any wrecker service which submits a successful application . . . and which otherwise [qualifies] for the privilege of engagement by the Sheriff's Office for the removal or storage of vehicles." Cherokee County Code, Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/21/index.html">3-25-21</a></span>. "Whenever any vehicle is removed by a wrecker service at the direction of the Sheriff's Office, the police officer shall make a thorough inventory of all equipment, accessories, personal articles and other items either attached to or located within the vehicle. . . .

Cherokee County Code, Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/30/index.html">3-25-30</a></span>. The County Code also prescribes detailed security requirements for impound lots and directs each approved wrecker service to submit "an inventory every two (2) weeks of all vehicles remaining in its possession and unclaimed by the owner." Cherokee County Code, Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/3/25/34/index.html">3-25-34</a></span> (d). The County Code also establishes a schedule of permitted fees and requires each approved wrecker service to "post in a conspicuous place on its premises a sign stating . . .: Note: The maximum fees which may be charged by wrecker services for removal and/or storage have been established by a county ordinance. You are entitled to a copy of the fee schedule upon request. Inquiries and complaints concerning any fees charged should be made to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office."

Because the amount of the obligation varies based on how often the county utilizes the services of a wrecker service, the statute does apply. See Baggett v.
