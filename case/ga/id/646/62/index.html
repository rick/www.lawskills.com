Clyde Lewis, a licensed real estate broker in Alabama, brought an action against Dr. Clayton D. Taylor, a Georgia resident, to recover a commission allegedly earned under a written contract to obtain a $50,000 loan for the defendant to be secured by defendant's realty situated in Alabama. The petition as amended, with attached exhibits, alleges substantially as follows: That the handwritten contract, executed on January 29, 1964, provided in part as follows: "Signer(s) states . . . that if the loan is not closed because of failure of signer(s) to comply with any terms of accepted commitment or approval letter all expenses incurred by Company [lender] in processing this application, including cost of appraising security, will be paid . . . Signer(s) has engaged J. Clyde Lewis as his agent to negotiate the loan for a fee of 1 1/4% to be paid by signer(s) if a [disputed word] is obtained for 40,000 <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> [sic] under the terms herein applied for" (emphasis supplied); that, on the same date, plaintiff submitted defendant's loan application to Kansas City Life Insurance Co., and subsequently notified defendant that the company had approved his application and would issue a written commitment; that in a letter to plaintiff dated February 10, 1964, attached as an exhibit, defendant stated that he was ready to accept the loan on the agreed terms, etc.; that on February 19, 1964, the company mailed to the plaintiff and defendant a written commitment, stating that the loan had been approved subject to the following conditions and requirements: "1. Examination and approval of title, 2. Title Policy issued by a Company acceptable to us. 3. Credit report satisfactory to us. 4. $6,000 Fire &amp; Extended Cov. Insurance. $5,000 on the house and $1,000 on the barn . . . 10. Following additional conditions and requirements must be met to our satisfaction: This commitment will not be binding until we have received a deposit of $500. This deposit will be refunded at the time the loan is closed. If the loan is not closed through any fault of the applicant, the deposit will be retained by the Company. Please furnish list of Dr. Taylor's stocks and bonds. This was not attached to financial statement as indicated. When and if the loan is closed, you will be paid a 1 &amp; [sic] commission. Expiration date of this commitment, if accepted by applicant is May 19, 1964, unless renewed by us at our option" (Emphasis supplied); that, on February 24, 1964, the plaintiff wrote the defendant, giving him instructions for complying with the company's conditions and requirements; that, by letter dated February 26, 1964, plaintiff notified defendant that his credit had been approved; that, by letter dated March 19, 1964; plaintiff again requested that the defendant make his $500 deposit to the company as a binder on the loan; that, by letter dated March 25, 1964, the company again requested the deposit from defendant, stating that the commitment was not binding until the deposit was received; that, by letter dated April 13, 1964, the company notified defendant that the commitment would be canceled unless the deposit was received by one week from the date of said letter; that, by letter dated April 24, 1964, the company notified defendant that it was returning defendant's $500 check inasmuch as it had been dated April 20 and enclosed in a letter postmarked April 21.</div><div class="casepar">The court overruled the defendant's renewed general demurrer to the petition as amended, from which judgment the defendant appeals.</div><div class="casepar">The pleadings show that the parties had a valid contract for the procurement of a loan and that the defendant had complied with all of the conditions and requirements insisted upon by the lending company except for the $500 deposit. The fact that the deposit was not specified as a condition of the loan in the loan application does not make it an invalid condition. As indicated in the statement of facts hereinabove, the defendant agreed in the loan application that he would pay the company's expenses in processing the application if the loan was not closed because of his failure to comply with any terms of accepted commitment or approval letter. In the plaintiff's letter notifying defendant of the approval of his loan application, the deposit was clearly made one of the terms. It is true that the loan application provided for an expiration date of the commitment of May 19, 1964, and that the defendant's deposit tendered prior to that date was rejected. It will be noted, however, that this expiration date applies to the commitment " if accepted by applicant." Although the application specifies no other time limit for the acceptance of the commitment, the defendant was apprised of the condition of the deposit not only by the company's written commitment, but by one letter from the plaintiff and no less than four letters from the company. Defendant is estopped to deny the validity of this required condition after failing to answer any of said letters, make any protest whatsoever, and finally sending his check for the deposit to the company subsequent to the deadline of which the company had notified him.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, the plaintiff had complied with his obligation under the contract whether the disputed word was "loan" or "com." (commitment), since he had procured a written commitment for a loan, the consummation of which was prevented by the defendant's failure to comply with the conditions and requirements of the loan, as specified by the lending company. The petition as amended stated a cause of action; therefore, the court did not err in its judgment overruling the renewed general demurrer thereto.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="casenotes"><div class="header">
