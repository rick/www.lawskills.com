Eldridge, J., and Senior Appellate Judge Harold R. Banke concur.</div><div class="casepresiding">Letter of credit. Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Lane.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Jurisco, Inc. appeals from a court order directing the clerk of court to pay out $100,000 deposited with the court by Bank South in an interpleader action on proceeds due under a letter of credit. Jurisco claims the money should not have been paid pursuant to the letter of credit because American Bonding Company's (ABC's) attempt to draw on the entire letter of credit constitutes fraud and also because the deputy receiver who presented the letter of credit for payment was not an "authorized officer of the American Bonding Company," as required by the terms of the letter of credit. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">This action arose as the result of a Producer Agreement between Jurisco and ABC under which ABC authorized Jurisco to receive and accept proposals for the issuance of bonds. ABC requested the letter of credit from Bank South because Jurisco was responsible under the agreement for paying all bond claims submitted of $50,000 or less.</div><div class="casepar">On April 19, 1995, Bank South wrote to ABC, which was in receivership at the time, and informed it that the letter of credit was due to expire on May 25 and would not be renewed. At that time, ABC claimed Jurisco owed approximately $53,000 plus interest on the account balance for premiums collected which had not been forwarded to ABC.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, on May 9, 1995, ABC sent a demand to Bank South for payment on the letter of credit. Bank South determined the documents accompanying the demand were in compliance with the letter of credit and it should be paid.</div><div class="casepar">On May 18, 1995, Jurisco filed suit against Bank South, seeking a temporary restraining order preventing it from paying ABC. Jurisco attached to its complaint a copy of an order from the Georgia Commission of Insurance suspending ABC's Certificate of Authority and ordering it to cease and desist from writing insurance in Georgia. Also attached to the complaint was an order from the Department of Insurance of Arizona suspending ABC's authority to transact new and renewal insurance business, other than surety, in Arizona.</div><div class="casepar">The court held a hearing which Bank South did not attend, and granted Jurisco an order preventing Bank South from paying the letter of credit. ABC, after learning of the restraining order, filed a motion to intervene and a motion to dissolve the restraining order. On May 24, 1995, the court granted ABC's motion to intervene and ordered Bank South to pay the $100,000 letter of credit into the registry of the court. On June 26, 1995, ABC filed a Claim, Response and Answer of Intervenor, claiming the funds in the registry.</div><div class="casepar">ABC then filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming it had complied with the terms of the letter of credit and was entitled to the $100,000. On July 15, 1996, the court denied the motion and ruled the parties should go to arbitration on the underlying contract issues. In this order, the court dismissed Bank South as a defendant and designated the intervenor, ABC, as defendant in the case. ABC filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that any contract disputes under the Producer Agreement were not properly before the court and should not have been considered in a summary judgment motion based solely on whether the criteria for payment of the letter of credit were met. ABC contended Jurisco had an adequate remedy at law and should pursue its breach of contract or fraud claims in a different action.</div><div class="casepar">After hearing argument on the Motion for Reconsideration, the court found, pursuant to the "independence principle" which governs payment on letters of credit, that ABC had complied with the requirements for payment and ordered the Clerk to pay the $100,000 to ABC.</div><div class="casepar">On November 12, 1996, after ABC received the funds, Jurisco filed an Emergency Motion and Brief for Protection pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/62/index.html">9-11-62</a></span>. The court issued an Amended Order on Motion for Reconsideration denying Jurisco's request for protection under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/62/index.html">9-11-62</a></span>. Jurisco now appeals both this order and the order directing payment of the funds to ABC.</div><div class="casepar">The letter of credit in question provided that payment would be available to ABC "against your draft at sight drawn on Bank South, N.A. . . . and accompanied by the following documents:</div><div class="casepar">"(1) The original of this letter of Credit and all amendments thereto, if any, must be presented at the time of any drawing hereunder for our endorsement.</div><div class="casepar">"(2) A signed written statement from an authorized officer of the American Bonding Company that:</div><div class="casepar">"(a) 'Jurisco, Inc. is in specific default of its agency's agreement with American Bonding Company dated June 16, 1993, to cause American Bonding Company a loss or incurred expense'; OR</div><div class="casepar">"(b) 'Jurisco, Inc. has failed to remit, in accordance with its agency's agreement with American Bonding Company dated June 16, 1993, account current balances due American Bonding Company'; OR</div><div class="casepar">"(c) 'Jurisco, Inc. for failure to [sic] reimburse company for any claim as agreed to under said contract or provided under Section 2 of the profit sharing agreement.'</div><div class="casepar">" 'This letter of Credit sets forth in full the terms of our undertaking and such undertaking shall not in any way be modified amended, or amplified by reference to any document(s), instrument(s), contract(s), or agreement(s) referred to herein or in which this letter of Credit is referred to or to which the letter of Credit relates, and any such reference shall not be deeded [sic] to incorporate herein by reference any document(s), instrument(s), contract(s) or agreement(s).' "</div><div class="casepar">1. First, Jurisco argues that Michael FitzGibbons, the receiver for ABC, was not "an authorized officer of the American Bonding Company," as required under the letter of credit. Jurisco claims the parties did not intend to allow the situation to arise where a receive would be able to demand payment on a letter of credit. But, this does not affect the bank's obligation to pay "Unless certain narrow exceptions apply, issuer must disregard what it cannot glean from carefully examining the face of required documents as presented. Beyond that examination, issuer has no duty to look deeper for forgeries, falsifications, inaccuracies, or other defects in the documents. Nor is issuer bound to look beyond the four corners of presented documents for facts that might cure discrepancies, omissions, or inconsistencies in the papers." (Footnotes omitted.) James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code,  26-5 at 139 (4th ed. 1995).</div><div class="casepar">There is an issue, however, as to whether a successor by operation of law, such as a receiver or a trustee, may demand payment on a letter of credit. There is no Georgia case law on this subject and other states are divided on the issue. But, it is important to note that this issue will be resolved under Revised Article V, Section 5-113. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> The Revised Code resolves this conflict in the laws by allowing successor by operation of law to demand payment on a letter of credit. White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-12 at 199.</div><div class="casepar">In looking to other states' case law, some courts have held that a party who succeeds by operation of law may demand payment, while another line holds that "strict compliance" requires the opposite result. White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-12 at 198-199. See, e.g., Eakin v. Continental Ill. Nat. Bank, 875 F2d 114 (7th Cir. 1989); In re Swift Aire Lines, 30 BR 490 (1983); Pastor v. Nat. Republic Bank, 390 NE2d 894 (1979).</div><div class="casepar">However, this is not crucial to our determination, as some cases reason that the liquidator is a representative of the beneficiary and even under strict compliance the issuer would not be misled by the presentation. White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-12 at 198. Therefore, for these reasons and in light of the fact that under Revised Article V a successor by operation of law will be able to draw on the letter of credit, we find that the beneficiary was entitled to make a demand for payment on the letter of credit.</div><div class="casepar">2. The trial court correctly determined that the "independence principle," codified at OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/11/5/114/index.html">11-5-114</a></span>, required the Bank to pay on the letter of credit. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/11/5/114/index.html">11-5-114</a></span> provides in pertinent part: "(1) An issuer must honor a draft or demand for payment which complies with the terms of the relevant credit regardless of whether the goods or documents conform to the underlying contract for sale or other contract between the customer and the beneficiary." In other words, the independence principle "states that the bank's obligation to the beneficiary is independent of the beneficiary's performance on the underlying contract. Put another way, the issuer must pay on a proper demand from the beneficiary even though the beneficiary may have breached the underlying contract with the applicant." White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-2 at 113. See also Dibrell Bros. Intl. v. Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro, 38 F3d 1571, 1579 (11th Cir. 1994).</div><div class="casepar">Jurisco states that the independence principle does not apply when there is fraud involved. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/11/5/114/index.html">11-5-114</a></span> (2). But, Jurisco has not put forward any evidence sufficient to show fraud either in the submission of the letter of credit or in the underlying transaction.</div><div class="casepar">Jurisco argues that because ABC stated in its Claim Response and Answer that it requested relief in the amount of $100,000 or, in the alternative, the $53,287 it claims was owed by Jurisco, it could not demand payment of the full letter of credit because the full amount was not owed. Jurisco contends that this demand for the full amount constituted fraud by ABC.</div><div class="casepar">Pretermitting the issue of whether ABC was entitled to demand the full amount under the letter of credit, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> Jurisco's complaint does not allege fraud and the allegations in its brief are not sufficient to show fraud. Also, there is no evidence that ABC ever misrepresented to Bank South or Jurisco the amount actually owed.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, the fraud required to enjoin payment on a letter of Credit must be "fraud so serious as to make it obviously pointless</div><div class="casepar">App. 1989).</div><div class="casepar">and unjust to permit the beneficiary to obtain the money. . . . Where the beneficiary's conduct has so vitiated the entire transaction that the legitimate purposes of the independence of the issuer's obligation would no longer be served. . . ." (Citations and punctuation emitted.) Ground Air Transfer v. Westates Airlines, 899 F2d 1269, 1272-1273 (1st Cir. 1990), cited by White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-10 at 181-182; Philipp Bros., Inc. v. Oil Country Specialists, 709 SW2d 262, 265 (Tex. App. 1986); N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Hartford Nat. Bank &amp;c. Co., 378 A2d 562, 567 (1977); Intraworld Indus. v. Girard Trust Bank, 336 A2d 316 (1975).</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the fraud exception to the "independence principle" does not apply in this case as the record shows nothing fraudulent in ABC's demand for payment. Thus, pursuant to the "independence principle," any issue as to whether ABC was entitled to the full amount of the letter of credit <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> is not before us. The sole issue before the trial court and thus the sole issue on appeal, is whether the documents presented by ABC to Bank South satisfied the prerequisites for payment on the letter of credit. We hold that they did and, therefore, the trial court did not err in ordering the money paid to ABC.</div><div class="casepar">3. In light of our holding in Division 1 above, we need not address Jurisco's second enumeration of error. Likewise, ABC's motion to dismiss this appeal is denied as moot.</div><div class="casepar">Alston &amp; Bird, Steven M. Collins, Siegel &amp; Golder, Mark L. Golder, Lynn L.

      This issue is settled by Revised Article V which adopts the strict compliance standard. White &amp; Summers, supra,  26-7 at 159.
