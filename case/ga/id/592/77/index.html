Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Alverson.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">CLARK, Judge.</div><div class="casepar">This appeal is by Robinson, plaintiff below, from a summary judgment holding no legal liability upon defendant Pollard who was the owner of a large truck which had been driven into the rear of plaintiff's car. The defense accepted by the court below was that the truck was at the time being driven by an individual named Porter, a total stranger to defendant, not an employee, and thus not authorized to have possession of the truck.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff seeks to hold Pollard liable on the basis of "special circumstances." In doing so reliance is placed upon an allegation that the truck was left at a service station in a high crime area in Atlanta with the keys remaining in the ignition, this having been done by an employee named Bowden. Claiming Bowden had a propensity for imbibing alcohol in excess, particularly on weekends, there is an additional theory of "negligent entrustment."</div><div class="casepar">At the date of the occurrence Pollard had been engaged for approximately 5 1/2 years in operating a business known as City Van Service. He owned six trucks and had five employees including Bowden. He had rented the premises at the corner of Simpson and West Lake Drive in Atlanta, to provide a location for parking his trucks and where mechanical repairs could be made. This location was near both his residence and that of Bowden. Around 7 a.m. on Saturday morning September 9, 1972, Bowden, who was entrusted with the keys to the large Mack truck he operated, undertook to warm-up the motor so that the truck would be ready for use if needed. Around 7:15 a.m. Pollard informed him that the truck would not be used that day. Both Pollard and Bowden departed from the scene. Apparently the ignition keys were not removed. Around 1 p.m. that afternoon a collision occurred between plaintiff's automobile and Pollard's truck. It was then being driven by Porter but it is not clear as to how he came into possession of the truck. In any event, he was not authorized to use it and he was in no way connected with the owner of the truck.</div><div class="casepar">1. Appellant seeks to establish liability on the truck owner by averring a legal theory of "special circumstances." In doing so reliance is placed upon the California case of Hergenrether v. East, 61 Cal. 2d 440 (393 P2d 164) which has a factual basis somewhat similar to the case at bar in that a truck had been parked on the street in a skid-row neighborhood with the key left in the ignition. The California court held that in view of the "special circumstances" the matter of foreseeability and negligence was for the jury to determine. This California case is contrary to the overwhelming majority <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> view as noted in 51 ALR2d 633 where the annotation points out that in most jurisdictions a third party cannot recover from the owner or operator who leaves keys in an ignition in the absence of a statute obligating the motorist to remove his keys from the ignition when leaving his car unattended on a public street.</div><div class="casepar">Although the California court ruled there were "special circumstances" it should be noted in that case that the vehicle was left on the street. In the instant case the vehicle was left on private property at a service station. This business establishment was convenient for the owner and his employee as they resided in the neighborhood. Even if the employee had left the ignition keys in this big truck at 7:15 a.m. it was not foreseeable that five hours later this large vehicle would be taken from private property by a party who had no relationship of any kind with the owner.</div><div class="casepar">Additionally, mere ownership of a motor vehicle does not create liability upon the owner. Price v. Star Service &amp; Petroleum Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/31/index.html">119 Ga. App. 171 (4) (166 SE2d 593)</a></span>; Finnocchio v. Lunsford, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../600/67/index.html">129 Ga. App. 694</a></span>, 695 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../600/67/index.html">201 SE2d 1</a></span>). Nor can we accept appellant's theory that a large diesel truck should be regarded as a dangerous instrumentality in the light of our many decisions refusing to hold a motor vehicle to be in this category as exemplified by the early case of Fielder v. Davison, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 509 (77 SE 618)</span> and subsequent cases appearing in Shepard's Citations.</div><div class="casepar">In two Georgia cases wherein this court has been called upon to decide this question concerning ignition keys we have held there is no liability arising from the fact of keys being left in a car. In Roach v. Dozier, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../689/77/index.html">97 Ga. App. 568 (103 SE2d 691)</a></span> plaintiff sought to hold a defendant, whose nephew had taken the family business funeral hearse liable under the attractive nuisance doctrine. This court rejected the concept that the hearse could come within the attractive nuisance doctrine and ruled there was no liability. The court added that even if the defendant had constructive notice of previous "joy rides" by the nephew he could not have breached his duty of ordinary care by leaving the keys in the ignition. The defendant could only have been found negligent if he possessed actual knowledge that his nephew previously used the hearse.</div><div class="casepar">In Chester v. Evans, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/59/index.html">115 Ga. App. 46 (153 SE2d 583)</a></span> this court ruled no liability could be imposed upon a father for leaving the keys in his automobile which was being driven by his 13-year-old son at the time of the accident in the absence of an allegation that his son had previously disobeyed his instructions not to drive the car. It should be noted that in the case sub judice there is no showing of any prior practice of keys being left in the truck nor of any previous conduct of the type plaintiff has complained of so as to create a reasonable foreseeability that the large truck was likely to be stolen from the service station.</div><div class="casepar">2. The case which we regard as controlling upon the case at bar is Brown v. Sheffield, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../624/15/index.html">121 Ga. App. 383 (173 SE2d 891)</a></span>. We quote applicable portions of headnotes 1, 2 and 3 as being dispositive of this case: "1. The owner of a vehicle is not liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for injuries inflicted by negligence of the operator while it was being operated on a mission purely personal to the operator. 2. (a) Unless it appears that the owner had actual knowledge of the operator's incompetency as a driver there is no liability on the owner's part on the theory of negligent entrustment. 3. (a) When one drives the vehicle of another contrary to the owner's express instructions not to do so, and without the knowledge or consent of the owner, there is no entrustment of the vehicle to the driver, and the owner can not be held on the theory of negligent entrustment." Here Bowden had received specific instructions from Pollard that the vehicle was not to be used for personal matters and that under no circumstances was he to allow any other person to operate his equipment.</div><div class="casepar">3. Since the record discloses the absence of a legal right of recovery against the truck owner the grant of a summary judgment to defendant Pollard by the trial court was correct. Plywood Supply Co. v. Allrid, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/34/index.html">119 Ga. App. 182 (166 SE2d 401)</a></span> and Crawford v. McDonald, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../610/75/index.html">125 Ga. App. 289</a></span>, 293 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../610/75/index.html">187 SE2d 542</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">DEEN, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">Porter then negligently collided with the plaintiff's vehicle.</div><div class="casepar">The case does not hinge on whether or not Porter was a thief, but on whether or not Pollard negligently entrusted the vehicle and keys to Bowden over the weekend when he knew or should have known that Bowden drank heavily over the weekend and when he was drunk was likely to be unreliable. Neither does it rest on any doctrine of respondeat superior, since the owner of a vehicle is not liable under this theory for injuries inflicted by the negligence of an employee who is using the car on a personal mission and against company rules. Don Swann Sales v. Carswell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../613/29/index.html">124 Ga. App. 141 (183 SE2d 218)</a></span>. But the safekeeping of the truck over the weekend, if in Bowden's charge, would also be in the course of his employment.</div><div class="casepar">306 (<span class="casemissing">167 SE2d 198</span>).</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, if Porter be considered merely as a thief, I consider the annotation in 51 ALR2d 633, 662,  17 (Thieves) as also supporting my view that a jury question is presented: "On the other hand, if, at the time of the negligence, the criminal act might reasonably have been foreseen, the causal chain is not broken by the intervention of [the larceny]."</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent.</div><div class="casepar">EVANS, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">The majority opinion holds there was nothing for a jury to pass upon in this case, and affirms the trial court in granting a summary judgment for the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">This is a case of first impression in Georgia. The facts are that Pollard, defendant, employed Bowden, as truck-driver. Bowden had a propensity for drinking alcoholic beverages to excess, particularly on weekends, which was well known by his employer. Nevertheless, on a Saturday morning Bowden was entrusted with the keys to a large Mack truck owned by defendant. Bowden warmed the truck up at 7:00 a.m., preparatory to driving the truck during the day for defendant, but was notified around 7:15 a.m. that the truck would not be used that day. Bowden walked away and left the truck unlocked, and with the ignition keys in the same, in a high-crime area in Atlanta. An intermeddler, stranger to both defendant and the truck-driver, got into the truck and drove it away from its parked position, and collided with plaintiff's automobile.</div><div class="casepar">This is not a case where a child drives his father's automobile after locating the keys, and the question of a father's responsibility for the conduct of his minor child is not here involved. Despite that, the majority opinion cites two parent-and-child cases as its authority for holding there was no jury issue as to liability, to wit, Roach v. Dozier, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../689/77/index.html">97 Ga. App. 568 (103 SE2d 691)</a></span>, where a 15-year-old son drove his father's hearse without permission and caused a collision; and Chester v. Evans, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/59/index.html">115 Ga. App. 46 (153 SE2d 583)</a></span>, where a 13 year-old-child drove his father's Dodge automobile without permission and caused a collision. We repeat that these cases are inapplicable. The majority states that it considers as controlling the case of Brown v. Sheffield, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../624/15/index.html">121 Ga. App. 383 (173 SE2d 891)</a></span>, which was decided squarely on the doctrine of respondeat superior and on doctrine of negligent entrustment to an incompetent driver. It was held that declaratory judgment should have been granted as to Count 1 (respond eat superior), and should not have been granted as to Count 2 (negligent entrustment). It is more than a little difficult to understand how the majority opinion can contend that the above authority is controlling as to the case now under construction, and how it supports the position of the majority, especially as it was there held a good cause of action was set forth as to negligent entrustment.</div><div class="casepar">Not a single one of the three Georgia cases cited involves the leaving of a motor vehicle parked in a high-crime area, unlocked, and with the ignition keys in the ignition switch!</div><div class="casepar">The majority opinion comments on the California case of Hergenrether v. East, 61 Cal. 2d 440 (393 P2d 164), which involved a truck parked on the street in a skid-row neighborhood with the key left in the ignition, and states that the California court held that a jury question of liability was thus presented. (These are facts very kindred to the facts in the case sub judice).</div><div class="casepar">And then the majority opinion makes this amazing statement: "This California case is contrary to the overwhelming majority view as noted in 51 ALR2d 633 where the annotation points out that in most jurisdictions a third party cannot recover from the owner or operator who leaves keys in an ignition in the absence of a statute obligating the motorist to remove his keys from the ignition when leaving the car unattended on a public street." I do not read 51 ALR2d as do my distinguished associates. I believe exactly the reverse of the foregoing statement is true, and that a vast majority of the cases cited in 51 ALR2d 633 et seq. support a cause of action against one who leaves keys in the ignition switch in a place where the car might reasonably be driven off by a third person; and at the very least, a jury question is made as to liability.</div><div class="casepar">First of all, page 633, which the majority cites, is an Index only, and lists: "Locking ignition or door, 646. Disposition of keys, 651." Now, i feel compelled to quote from those pages and other pages following in context in rebuttal of the majority opinion's assertion that this volume of ALR shows the vast majority view in most jurisdictions is against recovery as to the operator who leaves car keys in the ignition switch. The language at page 646 is as follows: "Numerous cases hold or recognize that failing to secure the ignition switch of a motor vehicle and leaving the door unlocked, when parking such a vehicle in a public street, are circumstances tending to establish negligence which gives rise to liability where the vehicle is thereafter set in motion by an intermeddler and injury or damage to another results.</div><div class="casepar">"Connecticut.-- Block v.
