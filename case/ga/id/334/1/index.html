However, OCGA Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c) provides an exception to those procedures, when a city engages in "trading or swapping" property when that is "deemed to be in the best interest of the municipal corporation."</div><div class="casepar">The Court has considered Plaintiffs' thorough analysis of the historical background surrounding the creation of public parks in the City of Brunswick, and their summary of past legislative efforts to protect them.

Such sales may be made in the open market without advertisement and without the acceptance of bids. The estimation of the value of any personal property to be sold shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the governing authorities of the municipality or their designated agent. Provided, however, nothing herein shall prevent a municipality from trading or swapping property with another property owner, if said trade or swap is deemed to be in the best interest of the municipality. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3.

It was divided into six subparagraphs (the latter three being unrelated to this appeal). The first subparagraph carried forward existing restrictions upon the disposition of city property (the 1976 act). The second sub-paragraph continued the 1976 act's authorization of a municipal corporation to sell lots from a municipal cemetery, and to sell personal property belonging to the municipal corporation having an estimated value of $500 or less. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> The third subparagraph repeated the final sentence of the 1976 act (Division 2 (b), above), altered slightly so as to read:</div><div class="casepar">Nothing in this Code section shall prevent a municipal corporation from trading or swapping property with another property owner if such trade or swap is deemed to be in the best interest of the municipal corporation.</div><div class="casepar">(b) It is on this third subparagraph, now OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c), that the city and church place their principal reliance.</div><div class="casepar">The issue</div><div class="casepar">4. (a) The problem of statutory construction in this case thus becomes an analysis, not so much of words, but of punctuation and new subparagraph structures; and of their effect upon existing statutes as rearranged; and upon the common law. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(b) The following precepts are instructive:</div><div class="casepar">(i) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/1/1/2/index.html">1-1-2</a></span> provides in part:</div><div class="casepar">Except as otherwise specifically provided by particular provisions of this Code, the enactment of this Code by the General Assembly is not intended to alter the substantive law in existence on the effective date of this Code.

(a) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/34/3/index.html">36-34-3</a></span> delineates the general powers of municipal corporations. These include the power to accept by gift, to operate, to regulate, to open and close public parks "in the interest of the health and general welfare." The specified general powers do not include the power to alienate lands dedicated to public usage. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(b) What we now have with OCGA is simply a rearrangement of an existing statute into the first three subparagraphs of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span>. There is no statement of legislative intent. There is no new law to supplant "the old law"; there is no specified "evil" in the prior statutory scheme; and there is no declaration of "remedy." (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/1/3/1/index.html">1-3-1</a></span>, at Div. 4 (b) (ii), above.)</div><div class="casepar">(c) In sum, there is no indication that the General Assembly intended by this minor rearrangement to expand the powers of municipalities; or to relieve them of the bidding requirements of the 1976 act (Div. 2 (a), above); or to alter settled principles of the common law restricting the alienation of dedicated public lands. Vide note 3, above.</div><div class="casepar">6. Further, to read OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c) as a plenary grant of the power of "trading" and "swapping" city property generates logical possibilities that only can be described as bizarre. For example (and bearing in mind the statutory limitations upon the sale of city property), a city is prohibited from selling $600 worth of scrap iron unless it complies with the bidding requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (a). Yet, it could "swap" or "trade" the city hall itself for a goat! <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> The sole requisite would be that such an exchange be "deemed in the best interest" of the city.</div><div class="casepar">7.

Because OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c) grants municipalities the power to trade property when it is in the municipality's best interest, I would affirm.</div><div class="casepar">1. The code provision governing the disposition of municipal property requires any municipality disposing of real property to sell to the highest responsible bidder by sealed bids or auction, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Code section." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (a). The remaining subsections (b) through (h) provide exceptions to the general rule set out in subsection (a). Subsection (b) provides exceptions for personal property valued at less than $500 and municipal cemetery lots regardless of value. Subsection (c) deals with the exchange of property:</div><div class="casepar">Nothing in this Code section shall prevent a municipal corporation from trading or swapping property with another property owner if such trade or swap is deemed to be in the best interest of the municipal corporation.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c) (1987). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Construing the statutory language, subsection (c) enables municipalities to trade or swap property with another property owner without receiving sealed bids or conducting an auction so long as the exchange is in the best interest of the municipal corporation. The term "best interest of the municipal corporation" means an exchange for property of like or higher value to the municipal corporation. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> The city commission's minutes approving the exchange indicate that the church property was of equal size and value to the park property. Since the proposed exchange meets the best interest test, the Brunswick City Commission had the power to convey the park property in exchange for the church property.</div><div class="casepar">2. Contrary to the assertions of the majority opinion, the same analysis and result would have been reached under the statute prior to the 1983 recodification of the code. The previous code provision dealing with the sale of municipal property had three paragraphs. Paragraph one provided procedures for the sale of property to the highest bidder after notice of the proposed sale; paragraphs two and three contained exceptions. See Ga. Code Ann.  69-318 (Harrison 1976). The exceptions for the sale of cemetery lots, personal property valued at less than $500, and trading or swapping of property were contained in the second paragraph. Their position in the same paragraph does not mean that trading or swapping was limited solely to cemetery lots or personal property under $500, as the majority opinion contends. Instead, like OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> (c), the prior statute permitted municipalities to bypass the notice and bid requirements for the sale of property when the city planned to dispose of property by an exchange.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Presiding Justice Bell joins in this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Eugene Highsmith, Wallace E.

      For many decades, common law principles have restricted severely the alienation of dedicated public lands. Common law authorities include the following:(a) Mayor &amp;c. of Macon v. Franklin, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. 239 (1852)</span>:A dedication of land to public use is in the nature of an estoppel in pais, and where an attempt is made by the proprietor to revoke it by a sale of the land, he may be enjoined by any person interested in the use. [Id. at 239, hn. 5.]When a dedication is made by a Town or City, it enures to the benefit of all who are at the time, or may afterwards become citizens of the corporation. [Id. at 239, hn. 6.](b) Kirkland v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../190/77/index.html">209 Ga. 824 (76 SE2d 396) (1953)</a></span>:As a general rule, property held by a municipality for governmental or public uses can not be sold without express legislative authority, but must be devoted to the use and purpose for which it was intended. [Id. at 825, hn. 1.](c) Norton v. City of Gainesville, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../183/26/index.html">211 Ga. 387 (86 SE2d 234) (1955)</a></span>:There appears from the authorities to be a clear distinction between property purchased by a municipal corporation and held for use by it as an entity, or in its proprietary capacity, and property purchased by the city for the public use and benefit of its citizens. The title and power of disposition of property acquired for strictly corporate purposes and held in its proprietary capacity, are different from its title to property acquired for and dedicated to the public use of its inhabitants. As to the former, the power to dispose is unquestioned, but as to the latter, in the absence of express legislative authority, it is only where the public use has been abandoned or the property has become unsuitable or inadequate for the purpose to which it was dedicated that the city has power to dispose of such property. [Id. at 390.](d) City Council of Augusta v. Newsome, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/01/index.html">211 Ga. 899 (89 SE2d 485) (1955)</a></span>:"As a general rule, a municipality has no power to convey or sell land dedicated as a public park, square or common." [Cits.] [Id. at 899, hn. 1.] . . .[T]he only purported abandonment of said property was by resolution of the Mayor and Council of the City of Augusta, adopted after the filing of the petition before the court, in which it was provided that said property is hereby abandoned as a park and shall no longer be used for park purposes and shall be sold to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company (for private purposes). . . . [Id., hn. 2.]See also McQuillin, Mun. Corp.  28.38 (3d ed.) (1990 revised volume):A municipal corporation cannot sell or dispose of property devoted to a public governmental use or purpose, . . . without special statutory or charter authority, since as to governmental functions the municipality is a mere agent of the state and subject to control by the state legislative authorities. For instance, property may not be sold where it has been acquired or dedicated for public use as a common, or as a park. . . . In this sense all property is public which has been dedicated to public use, or which may be affected by a public trust, either general or special. Municipal corporations hold all property in which the public is interested, such as . . . parks . . . in trust for the use of the public; and, on principle, such trust property can be disposed of by the municipality only in accordance with the terms of the trust, i.e., in the public interest as declared by statute.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      See Whaley v.

[Id. at 385.]In Stepperson, Inc. v.

Orr, 440 U. S. 268 (99 SC 1102, 59 LE2d 306) (1979)." See also Porter v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../459/34/index.html">168 Ga.

      This rule appears in the Code of Georgia of 1861,  5 (9th). It was applied as recently as Sizemore v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/8/index.html">262 Ga. 214 (416 SE2d 500) (1992)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      Note that Ga. L. 1956, pp. 22-23, once provided:Any general or local law to the contrary notwithstanding, the State or any municipal corporation, county or other political subdivision thereof, shall have authority to sell, lease, grant, exchange or otherwise dispose of any property or interest therein comprising parks . . . or other property which has been dedicated to a public use for recreational or park purposes, or has been dedicated to a public use for recreational or park purposes by a private citizen, corporation, or association, and thereafter acquired by the State . . . without regard to whether said public use has been previously abandoned, or that said property has become unsuitable or inadequate for the purpose for which originally dedicated, said disposition to be on such terms and conditions as may be deemed desirable or necessary. Provided, however, that any lease under this Act shall be for a period not to exceed 5 years. [Emphasis supplied.] This act was repealed by Ga. L. 1958, pp. 116-117.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      See the concurring opinion of then Justice Clarke in Dept. of Transp. v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">255 Ga. 124 (337 SE2d 327) (1985)</span>:The literal method simply dictates that we not depart from the plain meaning of the language of the statute. The golden rule method would direct that we follow the literal method unless it produces contradiction, absurdity or such an inconvenience as to insure that the legislature meant something else.

      It may be of more than antiquarian interest to note that an act of the General Assembly of 1788 authorized the city commissioners of Brunswick:to sell at public vendue, at such times and places as they shall think proper, all or any of the vacant lots in the said town (except such as were originally reserved for the public use). . . . [Emphasis supplied.] [Watkins Digest, 381.]Additionally, an act of 1796 recited:And whereas, several persons have at sundry times made attempts to run up the commons of the said towns, but have often been defeated, in the caveat courts of the said county, by the exertions of some of the proprietors of the said towns of Brunswick and Frederica: Be it enacted, That any person or persons who may attempt to run any part of the said commons or towns of Brunswick and Frederica, under any pretense whatsoever, shall be liable to a fine of five hundred dollars, . . . [Watkins Digest, 599.]The term of the 1796 Act ("run up") has lost its currency. The Oxford English Dictionary offers (among many usages of "run") this: "to allow to run or feed at large, to graze (cattle, sheep, etc.)." ad. loc., 902a. For "run up" it suggests: "to build, erect, set up (a wall, etc.)." ad. loc., 907c. While its exact meaning remains obscure, the term likely involved the diversion of some aspect of public lands to some kind of private use.By an act of 1797, the General Assembly authorized the sale of a portion of the commons of Brunswick "after three months' public notice in one of the gazettes of Savannah. . . ." Marbury &amp; Crawford's Digest, 160.Since our earliest days, then, it has been the General Assembly that has authorized the sale of municipal park lands.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      Although the common law authorities cited in footnote three of the majority opinion prohibit a municipality from conveying land dedicated as a public park without express legislative authority, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/37/6/index.html">36-37-6</a></span> provides the necessary legislative authority to a municipal corporation to sell or dispose of property devoted to public use.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;
      Despite the majority opinion's warning of the "bizarre possibility" of a trade of city hall for a goat, such a trade would be an abuse of the city commission's discretion. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/30/2/index.html">36-30-2</a></span>; see also Goodman v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../786/1/index.html">246 Ga. 79</a></span>, 80 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../786/1/index.html">268 SE2d 663</a></span>) (1980) (city authorities may not exercise their power in a capricious and arbitrary manner). The requirement that the exchange meet the best interest of the municipality limits the trades that a city may make.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"></div><div class="casechrono">DECIDED JULY 16, 1992 -- RECONSIDERATION DENIED JULY 30, 1992.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="caseinlinks"><div class="header">
