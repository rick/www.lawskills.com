Where no error is assigned on the judgment overruling the motion for a new trial on the general grounds, and there is no proper assignment of error in the bill of exceptions on the direction of the verdict, the quantum of evidence is not before us for consideration.</div><div class="casepar">Auto Credit Company, Inc. brought suit against E. P. Van Norden and his wife to recover a deficiency judgment against them on a conditional sale contract and note which the Van Nordens had executed to Spring Street Motors (apparently a trade name of R. C. Foster) in connection with a purchase by them of an automobile, the contract having been assigned and the note indorsed without recourse by the payee to Auto Credit Company, Inc. It is alleged that the obligation became in default, that the contract was foreclosed and the automobile described therein brought to sale, and that after applying the receipts from the sale to the payment of the foreclosure costs and note, an unpaid balance of $547.28 remained. It is further alleged that lawful notice had been given the Van Nordens to bind them for the payment of attorney's fees. The contract and note were on the same printed form and a copy was attached to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Defendants filed their answer denying any indebtedness and further pleaded that there had been a material alteration of the contract "by the addition of a notary public subsequent to their signing, not in their presence and without their consent."</div><div class="casepar">The copy of the contract attached indicates that it was officially attested by R. C. Foster as a notary. The bill of exceptions recites that upon a hearing of the plea of material alteration counsel stipulated that "1. The defendants signed the instrument attached to plaintiff's petition in the view of Mr. R. C. Foster, alleged owner of Spring Street Motors, each of the defendants and Mr. R. C. Foster were present at the time of the signing and no other person was present. 2. There was no discussion among the parties defendant and the said Mr. Foster concerning the question of whether said document should or should not be witnessed, either by a common witness or a notary public. 3. Subsequent to the signing of said instrument by the defendants the notary, R. C. Foster, added his signature and seal to the contract out of their presence and without their knowledge, they neither having objected to it nor assented to it."</div><div class="casepar">The plea was overruled. The case then went to trial, the evidence consisting of depositions of the defendants, the instrument in question, and the plaintiff's ledger card. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Thereafter the defendants filed a motion for a new trial on the general grounds which was overruled. In the bill of exceptions error is assigned only on the denial of the plea of non est factum and on the direction of the verdict on the sole ground that it is contrary to law and the principles of justice.</div><div class="casepar">1. There is no proper assignment of error on the direction of a verdict, Moody v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. App. 258 (80 SE 911)</span>, and there is no assignment of error upon the overruling of the motion for a new trial which thus becomes the law of the case. The question of whether the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict, or to demand the verdict as directed, is accordingly not before us for decision.</div><div class="casepar">2. A single instrument containing a conditional sale contract and note is held in Georgia, contrary to the rule in many States, to be a negotiable instrument <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> within the purview of the N. I. L. Howard v. Trusco Finance Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../713/26/index.html">87 Ga. App. 509 (74 SE2d 379)</a></span>; Roberson v. First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../684/47/index.html">99 Ga. App. 156</a></span> (107 SE2d (169). This particular document is on a single piece of paper but is in the form of two instruments. At the top of the page is a conditional sale contract describing the automobile being purchased and stating that the deferred payments "are evidenced by promissory note of even date herewith," following which are the signatures of the purchasers and the witnessing signature of R. C. Foster, notary public. Immediately below this is the promissory note, also signed by the parties but not witnessed. If the instruments could be considered as separate, the ruling on the plea would be controlled by Code  20-802, which requires that a material alteration of a contract must, to render it void, be not only intentional but with intent to defraud the other party. It is here undisputed that the witnessing notary did in fact see the defendants sign the instrument, and that they did in fact sign it intending the legal consequences of the act, and that no fraud was practiced on them. With this view of the document the plea of non est factum was not sustainable. If, on the other hand the entire document be considered a negotiable instrument, then the witnessing signature appears at the proper place up in the body of the instrument and not after the signatures of the makers to the promissory note, which was the second set of signatures at the bottom of the page. Applying the rule relating to negotiable instruments in Code  14-906 that any material alteration of the instrument without the assent of all the parties thereon will void it without regard to fraudulent intent, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> and taking the narrow interpretation of this rule laid down in Cook v. Parks, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. App. 749 (169 SE 208)</span> and Williams v. F. S. Royster Guano Co., <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 711 (2) (21 SE2d 349)</span> to the effect that the procuring of a witness to sign an instrument is a material alteration regardless of any other circumstances, the question remains whether the overruling of the plea, if error, would require reversal. The plaintiffs first brought a bill of exceptions to this court assigning error only on this judgment, and we held that it was not a final judgment so as to be the subject of appeal. Van Norden v. Auto Credit Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../666/06/index.html">107 Ga. App. 676 (131 SE2d 123)</a></span>. Upon the subsequent trial of the case the defendant testified that the whole contract was blank when they signed it, and further in answer to the question, "Your contention is not that you do not owe the money but simply the fact that the contract was notarized by someone not in your presence, is that correct?" he stated, "Well, as far as the notary is concerned, I'm not too much concerned about that."</div><div class="casepar">It thus appears that when the defendants signed the promissory note it was a blank form; all the blanks were filled in after the makers left, and one of those blanks was that of the notary who saw the defendants actually sign the conditional sale contract embodied in or attached to the note. The delivery of a blank note or contract by the maker to the payee constitutes prima facie authority in the latter to complete the instrument. Code  14-214; Ryle v. Farmers &amp;c. Bank of Gordon, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 459</span>, 462 (<span class="casemissing">127 SE 233</span>). The only reason the addition of the signature of a witness to a conditional sale contract is material is that it allows recordation; since such instruments are recorded in the usual course of business the witnessing signature is a part of the completion of the instrument in this sense, and the testimony of the defendant himself shows that when he delivered the document back to the payee to have the blanks filled in he did not withhold his assent to the signature of the witness who had in fact witnessed his signature and that of his comaker. The filling in of this blank was accordingly included in the implied authority to fill in all the blanks prior to the signature of the witnesses at the bottom of the page following the promissory note.</div><div class="casepar">It appears more logical to us in this instance to consider the instruments as severable and apply to the conditional bill of sale the rule of Code  20-802 rather than of Code  14-906, but the same result is reached in either event. Under the first interpretation the addition of the signature would not void the instrument because there was no trick, concealment, or fraudulent intent involved. Under the second, if there was any error in entering up such a judgment under the wording of the stipulation on the trial of the plea (no evidence being introduced) it was rendered harmless by the evidence on the trial of the main case which showed that the payee did in fact have authority to complete the instrument.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
