The motion to dismiss the writ of error is overruled.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Where several defendants are sued in one action and after trial they file separate motions for new trial, it is not necessary for more than one brief of the evidence to be filed.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Deletions from the bill of exceptions made in the presence of opposing counsel prior to certification by the trial judge will not work a dismissal, absent any showing of fraud. The practice, however, is one that should be avoided so that there will be no appearance of irregularity when the bill of exceptions comes to this court.</div><div class="casepar">2. The general demurrer to the petition was properly overruled.</div><div class="casepar">3. The allegation--that, immediately after a collision and within three minutes thereof, a truck driver, one of the defendants in the case, stated that he was sorry the collision had occurred, that he was at fault, and that his employer (another defendant in the case) was covered by insurance and that the insurance company would make compensation to the plaintiff's husband for his injuries and damages--should have been stricken on special demurrer as an improper and harmful injection into the case of the immaterial and prejudicial fact that the defendant employer had liability insurance; the allegation does not show as a matter of law that the statement was a part of the res gestae, or that the probative value of the statement as to insurance outweighed its prejudicial effect.</div><div class="casepar">4. The particulars of a husband's injuries may be alleged in his wife's suit for loss of consortium for the limited purpose of showing how they affected her right of consortium.</div><div class="casepar">5. Where a master, having the control of or the right to control the operation of his vehicle by a servant, brings suit against the servant and a third party as joint tortfeasors to recover for injuries alleged to have been negligently inflicted upon him by them, the servant's negligence is not imputable to the master as between the master and the servant, but it is imputable to the master as between the master and the third party.</div><div class="casepar">The facts of this case are the same as those in Hightower v. Landrum, ante. Particular portions of the pleadings relevant will be more fully stated in the appropriate divisions of this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">To a verdict and judgment against all defendants the defendants William Bryant and Shapiro Packing Company filed their motion for new trial. Defendant Hightower filed a separate motion and only he filed a brief of the evidence. To orders overruling their demurrers, general and special, and their motion for new trial, as amended, Bryant and Shapiro Packing Company except.</div><div class="casepar">1. Defendant in error has moved to dismiss the bill of exceptions upon two grounds, viz., (a) that plaintiffs in error had not filed a brief of the evidence, and (b) that several lines in the bill of exceptions were marked out with ink without any explanation therefor. The motion is denied on both grounds.</div><div class="casepar">Specified as a part of the record in this bill of exceptions is the brief of the evidence filed by Hightower, a co-defendant in the trial court, in connection with his motion for new trial and which the trial judge certified to be a true and correct brief of the evidence adduced upon a trial of the case. The judge's certificate shows on its face that all three--Shapiro Packing Company, Bryant and Hightower--were parties defendant in the case. Where several defendants are sued in the same action and after verdict they file separate motions for new trial, it is not necessary for more than one brief of the evidence to be filed since there is but one true and correct brief of the evidence and any additional ones would be merely duplicates, serving only to encumber the record. Moreover, the motion would not be good even if there were no brief of the evidence, since the absence of a brief of evidence in connection with a motion for new trial is not a ground for dismissal of the writ of error.</div><div class="casepar">It appears that the words deleted from the bill of exceptions related only to the matter of the filing of one brief of evidence, rather than two. There is no allegation of fraud. On the contrary, there is certification by counsel for plaintiffs in error, and counsel for defendant in error conceded in his oral argument before this court, that the alterations were made in the presence of opposing counsel prior to the certification by the trial judge. Under these circumstances the alterations will not work a dismissal.</div><div class="casepar">2. The petition stated a cause of action against all defendants. Hence, it was proper to overrule the general demurrer. It may be observed here that although upon the trial it developed that the defendant Hightower was a servant of Jake Landrum, plaintiff's husband, under his control and direction at the time he operated the Landrum truck, those facts do not appear in the petition.</div><div class="casepar">3. The first special demurrer attacks particularly that portion of the alleged statement of defendant Bryant to the effect that his employer was covered by insurance and that the insurance company would make compensation to plaintiff (plaintiff's husband?) for his injuries and damages.</div><div class="casepar">The generally accepted rule is that the fact that a defendant is insured or otherwise indemnified against loss in the event of a recovery against him can not be shown as an independent fact by a plaintiff. ". . . [E]vidence that a defendant is protected by liability insurance is not admissible in the trial of an action in tort, and it is the general rule that such evidence is not only irrelevant and immaterial but harmful and prejudicial to the extent that where it is presented to the jury a timely motion for a mistrial may be granted. O'Neill Mfg. Co. v. Pruitt, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 577</span>, 579 (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 59</span>); Heinz v. Backus, <span class="casemissing">34 Ga. App. 203 (128 SE 915)</span>; Minnick v. Jackson, <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. App. 554</span>, 561 (<span class="casemissing">13 SE2d 891</span>); Decatur Chevrolet Co. v. White, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 362 (180 SE 377)</span>." McRee v. Atlanta Paper Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../718/95/index.html">84 Ga. App. 181</a></span>, 183 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../718/95/index.html">65 SE2d 832</a></span>), where the requiring of the plaintiff to purge his petition of the improper and prejudicial matter was upheld. The few cases in which this kind of evidence has been held admissible are distinguishable on their facts. In Sims v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 486 (126 SE 872)</span>, for example, the statement as to having insurance was made by the insured, rather than an employee of the insured, as in the instant case. While it is true that "[t] he admissions by an agent or attorney in fact, during the existence and in pursuance of his agency, shall be admissible against the principal," Code  38-406, the present admission goes beyond a mere admission of fault and includes the statement that the principal has insurance. Even if this should not amount to hearsay evidence, it is inadmissible for the reason that the defendant driver had no authority to implicate and prejudice his employer by these harmful statements. The statement in the Sims case was held to be admissible for the additional reason that it was a part of the res gestae. "Whether statements claimed to be a part of the res gestae are really such is a question of law to be determined by the court." Southern R. Co. v. Brown, <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 1 (5) (54 SE 911)</span>. "Declarations accompanying an act, or so nearly connected therewith in time as to be free from all suspicion of device or afterthought, shall be admissible in evidence as part of res gestae." Code  38-305. The petition alleged only that the statement was made "immediately after the collision and within three minutes thereof." "The proximity of time in which declarations are made to the main transaction is not the only test of their admissibility in evidence, but they must be also free from all suspicion of device or afterthought." Augusta &amp;c. R. Co. v. Randall, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. 304</span>, 311, 312 (<span class="casemissing">4 SE 674</span>). The facts alleged in the petition would not have shown the statement to be a part of the res gestae as a matter of law had they been evidence rather than merely allegations, hence, construing the petition against the pleader, it does not show the statement to be a part of the res gestae. Even the Sims case, supra, concedes that the general rule, that any suggestion made in the presence of the</div><div class="casepar">jury at the instance of the plaintiff indicating that the defendant has liability insurance will require a mistrial, "is properly applied in cases in which such evidence has no probative value as respects any legitimate issue in the case, and possibly where its probative value is so small when compared to its prejudicial effect that fairness and justice demand its exclusion." Sims v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 486</span>, 487 (2), supra.</div><div class="casepar">Both this court and the Supreme Court have held it proper for the trial court to require that pleadings be recast for the purpose of removing harmful or prejudicial references to insurance and other matters, these having no proper place in the pleadings and evidence with reference thereto being inadmissible. Rodgers v. Styles, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../681/92/index.html">100 Ga. App. 124 (3) (110 SE2d 582)</a></span>; Ray Clanton's &amp;c. Motors v. Conaway, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../683/30/index.html">100 Ga. App. 650 (112 SE2d 218)</a></span>; Shook v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/34/index.html">101 Ga. App. 128</a></span>, 130, 132 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/34/index.html">113 SE2d 155</a></span>); C. T. C. Finance Corp. v. Longmire, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/64/index.html">106 Ga. App. 326 (126 SE2d 714)</a></span>; Shaw v. Miller, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/56/index.html">215 Ga. 413</a></span>, 414 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/56/index.html">110 SE2d 759</a></span>). And see Cox v. DeJarnette, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/43/index.html">104 Ga. App. 664</a></span>, 673 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/43/index.html">123 SE2d 16</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, even if the evidence were admissible the allegation attacked by the demurrer ought to go out of the pleading. "Good pleading requires only that the plaintiff plainly and concisely state the material ultimate facts upon which [the plaintiff] depends for a recovery. As a general rule, the evidentiary facts upon which the plaintiff relies to prove the ultimate facts need not and should not be set forth in the pleadings." Lefkoff v. Sicro, <span class="casemissing">189 Ga. 554 (10)</span> (<span class="casemissing">6 SE2d 687</span>, 133 ALR 738).</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the judgment of the court in overruling the special demurrer to the paragraph of the petition containing the alleged statement of the driver as to insurance was reversible error.</div><div class="casepar">4. The other special demurrer is directed to allegations in the petition that plaintiff's husband had suffered: (a) injured vertebrae, preventing his working actively; (b) intense and continued physical pain; (c) confinement to bed for several months and permanent 75% loss of his ability to pursue his avocation (sic) as a farmer; (d) permanent 75 to 80% diminution of earning capacity amounting to a minimum of $2,000 per year; (e) mental distress because of inability to help care for his two children who have muscular dystrophy and require constant care and attention; (f) mental distress and anxiety by his loss of from $11,000 to $12,000 resulting from his inability to look after his crops and pigs; (g) mental agony and distress caused by his inability to support, care for, play and romp with his two helpless, paralytic children; (h) inability to support his family, necessitating his wife's working away from home; (i, j) as a result of all of which plaintiff has lost at least 90% of his society, companionship and consortium due to his change in personality from that of being cheerful to that of being gloomy and despairing.</div><div class="casepar">By amendment plaintiff alleged in this connection that she "does not seek a recovery for her husband's financial losses or his physical injuries, nor for his pain and suffering, but she does seek a recovery for her loss of her husband's society, companionship and consortium."</div><div class="casepar">"It is now recognized in this State that a wife has an independent cause of action for the loss of consortium of her husband due to a tortious injury inflicted upon him, although she may not in such action recover any item of damages which would be a proper item of damages in an action directly by the husband." Walden v. Coleman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../669/98/index.html">105 Ga. App. 242</a></span>, 243 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../669/98/index.html">124 SE2d 313</a></span>), and cases cited. "A suit brought by a wife for injuries to her husband, his earnings, earning capacity, and plea for recovery for pain and suffering cannot be maintained. Such suit is in the province of the husband only." Bailey v. Wilson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../682/74/index.html">100 Ga. App. 405 (3) (111 SE2d 106)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">5. For the reason stated in headnote 5 and dealt with in more particularity in the sixth division of Hightower v. Landrum, ante, the general grounds of the motion are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">However, for the reasons stated in Division 3 of this opinion the judgment here must be reversed.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
