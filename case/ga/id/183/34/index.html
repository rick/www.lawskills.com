Before Judge Anderson. Richmond Superior Court. October 21, 1954.</div><div class="casepresiding">MOBLEY, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The allegations in the present petition by a father to modify a decree awarding custody of the minor children to the mother, so as to reduce the amount of permanent alimony payable for support of the children and to change their custody, were insufficient to set forth a cause of action based on a change of facts and circumstances, occurring since the date of the decree, which affected the interest and welfare of the children.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Assuming every material allegation of the father's petition to be true, the conclusion is inescapable that he is in no position to care for and safeguard his children, and that to award their custody to him would not be to their best interest.</div><div class="casepar">2. The trial judge did not err in sustaining the motion to dismiss in the nature of a general demurrer, on the ground that the petition as amended failed to set forth a cause of action for the relief sought.</div><div class="casepar">On September 16, 1954, the father filed a motion to modify the decree as to custody and alimony, in which motion as twice amended he alleged substantially the following: Prior to the divorce decree the father was working for a named railroad and was earning approximately $450 per month. On August 30, 1954, he was discharged from the railroad due to a deduction of the crew, and he is presently drawing $37 per week unemployment compensation. He is unable to pay the $22 per week for the support of his minor children and also pay their medical and doctor bills. He has remarried and now has a two-month-old son, and has to provide for their support. He desires the custody of his minor children and, should the same be given to him, he would be in a position to provide for them by having them under the same roof with him. There has been a change of condition since the divorce decree, in that his wages have been cut drastically, he is in debt, is unable to pay his current bills, and is unable to pay the $22 per week, although he has done everything within his power to secure employment and make a livelihood for his family. The divorce decree was based upon an agreement of the parties, which became the judgment of the court, and in the decree there appears in the next-to-the-last paragraph and at the end thereof the words, "all until the further order of the court." He was advised at the time he entered into the agreement, and was under the impression, that the words "all until the further order of the court" were inserted so he would have the opportunity to have the final decree modified at any time upon a showing that his economic condition had changed to such an extent as to make it impossible for him to pay the sum of money set forth therein. The last time the mother permitted the children to visit him was on or about January 15, 1954, and since that time she has failed and refused to permit them to visit him in his home. The mother is poisoning the minds of his two sons against him and is instructing them not to respect and honor him and not to love him and is attempting to turn them against him. The above-mentioned conduct has taken place since the original divorce decree and now adversely affects the welfare of his children. The prayers, besides for a process and a rule nisi, were: that the divorce decree be remolded so as to reduce the weekly alimony payments for the support of the minor children; that the court find a change of condition has taken place since the divorce decree, and that the husband is unable to comply therewith; that the father be awarded the custody of his two minor children; and for general equitable relief.</div><div class="casepar">The mother filed a motion to strike on the grounds: the petition as amended fails to set forth any legal or equitable cause of action; and it appears that the judgment sought to be modified is a final decree except as to visitation, and no change of circumstances is shown that would authorize the court to modify the same. To an order sustaining the motion to strike, the father excepted. Other facts will be stated in the opinion.</div><div class="casepar"> Ordinarily, judgments for permanent alimony can not be changed, an exception thereto being where the judgment is by agreement between the parties and the agreement is incorporated in the decree. Hardy v. Bennington, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 523 (1)</span> (1 S. E. 2d 667); Chandler v. Chandler, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 40 (1)</span> (48 S. E. 2d 841).</div><div class="casepar">There was no reservation incorporated in the present decree reserving the right in the trial judge to modify the same in the exercise of his discretion in accordance with the economic condition of the father. However, it is alleged that the father was advised at the time he entered into the agreement that the words, "all until the further order of the court," were inserted so he would have the opportunity to have the decree modified at any time upon a showing that his economic condition had changed to such an extent as to make it impossible for him to pay the alimony for the support of the children.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive of the decree deal with jurisdiction of the court and the grant of a divorce between the parties. Paragraph 5 fixes the amount of alimony that the father was required to pay for the support of the minor children. Paragraph 6 disposes of household furniture. Paragraph 7 states what credit should be allowed the father in the event one of the children went into the military service. Paragraph 8 declares: "The custody of the said two children is granted to the mother, Mrs Rosa M. Crook, nevertheless the father, John Lee Crook, shall have the right to visit these children wherever they might be, between the hours of ten o'clock a.m. and six o'clock p.m., all until the further order of the court, and on one Sunday afternoon out of each month hereafter, defendant shall have the privilege of having the children with him away from the mother and the mother's home, between the hours of 12:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. provided he notifies the plaintiff, the mother of the children, at least six hours in advance of the Sunday afternoon he so wants the children. This is conditioned upon the payments hereinabove provided not being in arrears, all until the further order of the court." The 9th and last paragraph refers to $75 which had been previously awarded as attorneys' fees, and ordered payment thereof.</div><div class="casepar">Each paragraph of the decree is complete within itself. There is nothing in the decree which would authorize the conclusion that the words, "all until the further order of the court," which occur only in paragraph 8, were inserted for the purpose of reserving the right in the trial judge to modify the decree upon a showing that the father's economic condition had changed; and the father could not set up a prior or contemporaneous agreement, the effect of which would be to alter or modify its terms, where such agreement was not incorporated in the decree. Estes v. Estes, <span class="casemissing">192 Ga. 100</span> (14 S. E. 2d 680).</div><div class="casepar">The fact that a judge of the superior court is empowered to take into consideration a change in the father's financial condition in determining whether or not he should be adjudged in contempt does not have the effect of empowering the judge to abrogate or modify the liability as fixed by the decree. Banda v. Banda, <span class="casemissing">192 Ga. 5</span> (14 S. E. 2d 479), and cases cited.</div><div class="casepar">There is no allegation that the father complied with the requirement of the decree by giving the mother notice six hours in advance when he desired to have the children visit him, or that he paid the $22 per week awarded as alimony for support of the children until he was discharged by the railroad company.</div><div class="casepar">Assuming but not conceding that the allegations that the mother was poisoning the minds of the children against the father were not mere conclusions, and that they would have been sufficient in a proper case to show that the mother by the conduct complained of acted any differently than she did before and at the time of the rendition of the original decree--as to which see Fuller v. Fuller, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 719</span>, 725 (2) (30 S. E. 2d 600)--the allegations of the present petition to modify, construed most strongly against the pleader as must be done in passing upon a general demurrer, were insufficient to set forth a cause of action for a change in custody based on a change of facts and circumstances, occurring since the date of the decree, which affected the interest and welfare of the children. To state it differently, assuming every material allegation of the father's petition to be true, the conclusion is inescapable that he is in no position to care for and safeguard his children, and that to award their custody to him would not be to their best interest.</div><div class="casepar">Applying the foregoing principles, the trial judge did not err in sustaining the motion to strike in the nature of a general demurrer, on the ground that the petition as amended failed to set forth a cause of action for the relief sought.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Peebles &amp; Burnside, Aubray J. Allen, Isaac S.
