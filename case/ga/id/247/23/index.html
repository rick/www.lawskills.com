Banke.</div><div class="casepresiding">Action on policy. Fulton State Court. Before Judge Westmoreland.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This is the third appearance of this case here. The underlying action arose from a December 4, 1987 car accident in which Oluyole Pius Olukoya was injured while driving his taxi cab. Olukoya's medical care and treatment totaled about $2,000. But in early 1988, when Olukoya requested payment for his medical bills from his no-fault insurer, the American Association of Cab Companies, Inc. ("AACCI"), payment was not forthcoming. In two demand letters, Olukoya provided the police report from the accident and attached copies of his medical bills. Initially, AACCI denied Olukoya's claim for no-fault benefits because the medical care had not been rendered by authorized or "approved" providers. In Olukoya v. American Assn. of Cab Cos., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/37/index.html">202 Ga. App. 251</a></span>, 253-254 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/37/index.html">414 SE2d 275</a></span>) (1991), we held that AACCI, as a no-fault self-insurer, acted unlawfully under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/1/index.html">33-34-1</a></span> et seq. in restricting claims for services to certain designated providers. Notwithstanding that ruling, AACCI still did not pay Olukoya's medical claims. Thereafter, Olukoya refiled suit against AACCI and its president, Cheru Terefe, who with his wife owned all of AACCI's stock. Olukoya asserted claims for the unpaid no-fault benefits, bad faith, punitive damages, RICO violations, and attorney fees.</div><div class="casepar">Olukoya testified that he sustained injuries to his neck, wrist, and back from the accident and sought medical attention that same day from the Ashby Clinic. There, M. Sheikholislam, M.D. recommended x-rays of his wrist due to the pain and swelling. When Olukoya continued to experience neck and back pain, he sought treatment from Dr. Berklich, a chiropractor, and subsequently saw Gary Myerson, M.D., a board-certified physician. Dr. Myerson took x-rays and treated Olukoya for his neck and wrist problems including a ganglion cyst into which he injected a steroid. According to Dr. Myerson, he frequently saw ganglion cysts caused by trauma from such an accident. Dr. Myerson testified that AACCI never inquired about the treatment or paid his bill.</div><div class="casepar">Olukoya offered evidence that: AACCI unjustifiably delayed investigating his claim, failed to keep the statutory minimum of reserves to pay claims, wrongfully denied payments and that Terefe misused funds entrusted to AACCI. At trial, an insurance industry expert with 30 years' experience in claim processing, Wayne Rasmussen, reviewed this claim. Rasmussen testified that AACCI and Terefe had "everything they needed [in 1988] to pay at least some of the bills, if not all of them." After examining the file and other evidence, Rasmussen determined that AACCI and Terefe deviated from industry standards by doing absolutely nothing to investigate the claim for several years.</div><div class="casepar">The director of the Examinations Division for the Office of Insurance testified that AACCI was undercapitalized and failed to keep adequate financial reserves to pay claims. Lynn Birkett, a financial examiner for the Office of Insurance, discovered that Terefe had taken more than $130,000 in cash loans for his own use from AACCI reserves. Birkett testified that insurance companies are "strictly prohibited" from lending money to their officers.</div><div class="casepar">The defense's only witness was Terefe, the sole person responsible for denying Olukoya's claim. Although Terefe asserted that it was AACCI's procedure to verify bills before payment, he admitted that no one from AACCI ever contacted or attempted to contact Dr. Berklich, Dr. Myerson, or Westside Radiology Associates. AACCI refused to pay Dr. Myerson's bill because Terefe believed that the cyst was not related to the accident, despite Dr. Myerson's contrary medical opinion. Terefe offered no reason for refusing to pay the radiology bill which ruled out a wrist fracture. Terefe said he was not willing to pay any portion of Dr. Berklich's bills because "he's in the habit of padding bills." Terefe refused to pay the $845 bill from Dr. Sheikholislam because he felt that doctor was neither believable nor competent. Terefe had no medical training, and yet, did not seek any independent advice about the propriety of the treatment. Terefe conceded that despite receipt of the police report, copies of the invoices for medical treatment, and demand letters, he denied the claim and continued to deny it even after this Court held that it was unlawful to designate medical providers. Olukoya, 202 Ga. App. at 254 (2).</div><div class="casepar">After the jury returned a verdict for Olukoya for $1,784 in medical expenses, $3,731 in costs, a $446.06 penalty, and $69,525 in attorney fees, AACCI filed this appeal. In a cross-appeal, Olukoya contends the trial court erred by denying his request for post-trial attorney fees. Held:</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A98A0571</div><div class="casepar">1. In several enumerations of error, AACCI contends that the trial court committed reversible error by excluding information which AACCI claimed raised questions about the competency and credibility of Dr. Sheikholislam, one of Olukoya's treating physicians. It is undisputed that Dr. Sheikholislam, who provided the initial treatment to Olukoya, was duly licensed to practice medicine in Georgia at the time of that treatment. However, it is also undisputed that Dr. Sheikholislam had run afoul of state medical licensing officials in Texas and Georgia both before and after the time he provided that treatment. Ultimately, Dr. Sheikholislam pleaded guilty to two federal counts for unlawfully prescribing drugs and had his Georgia medical license revoked. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Prior to trial, AACCI proffered in mass a two-inch stack of numerous exhibits. This stack of more than 350 pages included exhibits concerning Dr. Sheikholislam's troubles with the Texas Board of Medical Examiners, a 46-count federal indictment, suspension of his DEA license, and a warrant for Dr. Sheikholislam's arrest for failure to report to his probation officer. Nothing in the proffer specifically addressed the treatment or condition of Olukoya. Olukoya opposed the admission of these documents claiming that they were irrelevant, hearsay, prejudicial, wholesale character assassination, and improper impeachment of a witness not present for trial. The trial court determined that Dr. Sheikholislam's subsequent federal prosecution and subsequent loss of his ability to practice medicine were irrelevant but reserved ruling on any evidence of Dr. Sheikholislam's troubles before he treated Olukoya.</div><div class="casepar">The admission or exclusion of evidence is reviewed by an abuse of discretion standard. Wood v. Browning-Ferris Indus. &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/01/index.html">206 Ga. App. 707</a></span>, 708 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/01/index.html">426 SE2d 186</a></span>) (1992). Questions of relevance are generally matters within the trial court's discretion, and 'it is not error to exclude evidence that is not related to an issue at trial. Sleeth v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../353/71/index.html">197 Ga. App. 349</a></span>, 350 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../353/71/index.html">398 SE2d 298</a></span>) (1990). Further, a judge may exercise discretion in excluding even otherwise relevant evidence if he finds that " ' "its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice or of confusing the issues or of misleading the jury." ' (Cit.)" Kane v. Cohen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../407/07/index.html">182 Ga. App. 485</a></span>, 487 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../407/07/index.html">356 SE2d 94</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">AACCI contends that the entire exhibit, which was solely aimed at attacking Dr. Sheikholislam, was admissible as original evidence to explain its conduct in denying benefits. See Jackson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../548/3/index.html">256 Ga. 536</a></span>, 537-538 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../548/3/index.html">350 SE2d 428</a></span>) (1986). We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">This case was originally controlled by the Georgia No-Fault Act (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/1/index.html">33-34-1</a></span> et seq.) repealed by Ga. L. 1991, p. 1608, effective October 1, 1991. Under that former law, no-fault benefits became overdue if not paid within 30 days after an insurer received "reasonable proof of the fact and the amount of loss sustained." Former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b). The failure to timely pay the principal claim for benefits subjected that insurer to a statutory penalty, attorney fees, and punitive damages where the insurer could not prove a good faith refusal to pay benefits within 60 days after proof of loss has been filed. Former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (c). But see State Farm &amp;c. Inc. Co. v. Young, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/46/index.html">207 Ga. App. 355</a></span>, 357 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/46/index.html">427 SE2d 835</a></span>) (1993); Terry v. State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/15/index.html">205 Ga. App. 224</a></span>, 227 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/15/index.html">422 SE2d 212</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">The date on which an insurer was deemed to have received "reasonable proof of the fact and the amount of loss sustained" by its insured was that date upon which the insurer received sufficient proof from the insured to enable the insurer to verify or disprove through the exercise of reasonable diligence the basic components of the insured's claim. Hufstetler v. Intl. Indem. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/70/index.html">183 Ga. App. 606</a></span>, 608 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/70/index.html">359 SE2d 399</a></span>) (1987). See Lawson v. State Farm &amp;c. In&amp; Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../538/8/index.html">256 Ga. 285</a></span>, 286 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../538/8/index.html">347 SE2d 565</a></span>) (1986) (purpose of statutory 30/60-day requirements was to ensure prompt payment after insurer receives proof of loss); see Strickland v. American Home Assurance Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../393/32/index.html">186 Ga. App. 425</a></span>, 428 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../393/32/index.html">367 SE2d 241</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, it is undisputed that AACCI received Olukoya's demand letters and proof of loss on March 16, 1988 and May 23, 1988 and that on June 21, 1988, AACCI took a "firm stand" in denying the claim. Thus, Olukoya's no-fault benefits became overdue as a matter of law 30 days after his demand and AACCI's exposure to the 25 percent statutory penalty and reasonable attorney fees ripened after the 60-day period expired. Former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b). Under the No-Fault Act, AACCI had the burden of showing that its failure or refusal to pay the benefits at issue within 30 days was based on "reasonable cause." Binns v. MARTA, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../695/2/index.html">250 Ga. 847</a></span>, 848 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../695/2/index.html">301 SE2d 877</a></span>) (1983) (a jury's determination of bad faith should be upheld on appeal where there is any evidence).</div><div class="casepar">Olukoya's expert testified without contradiction that AACCI had sufficient documentation before it to know that a claim was being made in 1988. Yet, the evidence is undisputed that AACCI took no action to verify the claim or to seek out any additional information it needed to verify the claim for several years, until sometime in 1992. Such inaction and delay plainly violated the legislative intent of mandating prompt resolution of no-fault claims. Hufstetler, 183 Ga. App. at 609 (2).</div><div class="casepar">Even assuming arguendo that AACCI did not realize that its initial denial of Olukoya's claim had no legal basis as we found in Olukoya, 202 Ga. App. at 254, AACCI still failed to process the claim within 30 days after that ruling (reconsideration denied December 12, 1991). By Terefe's own admission, he did not even bother to complete an investigation of the merits of the medical claims after this Court's decision in 1991, until after Olukoya refiled his complaint in September 1992: "[W]e were informed that the lawsuit was dismissed and we didn't pursue it [an investigation of the merits]." Because AACCI failed to process the claim within 30 or even 60 days of our decision in 1991, we believe that it would violate public policy as well as the intent of the No-Fault Act to permit AACCI to utilize derogatory information it obtained years after the claim ripened. See State Farm Fire &amp;c. Co. v. Martin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../434/04/index.html">174 Ga. App. 308</a></span>, 310 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../434/04/index.html">329 SE2d 577</a></span>) (1985) (litigation of issue of first impression does not mean insurer denied claim in good faith or insulate insurer from bad faith penalty); Knight v. Stevens Logging, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../437/74/index.html">173 Ga. App. 359</a></span>, 360 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../437/74/index.html">326 SE2d 494</a></span>) (1985) (judgment right for any reason will be upheld). Even assuming without deciding that part or all of the mega exhibit had been admissible to explain conduct as AACCI contends, the exhibit was still susceptible to being excluded on other grounds such as relevance, as the trial court found, or the improper injection of character into issue. Ivester v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/4/index.html">252 Ga. 333</a></span>, 335 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/4/index.html">313 SE2d 674</a></span>) (1984); Echols v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../436/07/index.html">174 Ga. App. 829</a></span>, 830 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../436/07/index.html">331 SE2d 619</a></span>) (1985). Accord DeCastro v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../276/89/index.html">221 Ga. App. 83</a></span>, 85 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../276/89/index.html">470 SE2d 748</a></span>) (1996). See Roper v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/8/index.html">263 Ga. 201</a></span>, 202 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/8/index.html">429 SE2d 668</a></span>) (1993) (evidence must be competent even though admissible under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/2/index.html">24-3-2</a></span>). At issue was whether the medical treatment for which Olukoya sought reimbursement arose from the automobile accident, not Dr. Sheikholislam's character.</div><div class="casepar">It is well established that where a document is tendered as a whole, it may be excluded in its entirety when a portion is inadmissible. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> A. M. Kidder &amp; Co. v. Clement A. Evans &amp; Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../636/37/index.html">117 Ga. App. 346</a></span>, 350 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../636/37/index.html">160 SE2d 869</a></span>) (1968). This massive exhibit contained hearsay and irrelevant information, such as: multiple copies of subpoenas to different pharmacists, a petition by the State for the release of Dr. Sheikholislam's psychiatric records, a subpoena to a GBI document examiner, a pretrial bond form, and an affidavit submitted to seek a sentence correction. After the trial court deemed the entire proffered exhibit inadmissible, AACCI failed to excise any documents which may have otherwise been admissible. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in rejecting the exhibit in its entirety. Moore v. Graham, 221 Ga. App.</div><div class="casepar">616, 617 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../278/90/index.html">472 SE2d 152</a></span>) (1996); Kane, 182 Ga. App. at 487 (2). See American Assn. of Cab Cos. v. Egeh, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/16/index.html">205 Ga. App. 228</a></span>, 231 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/16/index.html">421 SE2d 741</a></span>) (1992). To hold otherwise would effectively eviscerate the rule that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/2/index.html">24-3-2</a></span> is to be contained within its proper limits and applied sparingly Teague v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../646/6/index.html">252 Ga. 534</a></span>, 536 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../646/6/index.html">314 SE2d 910</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">AACCI also contends that as a result of the exclusion of these documents, it was foreclosed from informing the jury that it had legitimate reasons for denying the claim. This is simply not borne out by the record. The trial court did not preclude all discussion about Dr. Sheikholislam's treatment. On direct, when Terefe testified that he concluded that Dr. Sheikholislam was incompetent and not believable, he was not asked to explain the basis for this opinion. His counsel simply changed the subject. Later, when Terefe complained "I think I'm bound not to say the statements I would really like to answer," the trial court advised Terefe to talk with his attorney "and if you want him to follow up on it on redirect." This counsel did not do. We see no reason why AACCI should derive benefit from its tactical blunder in not electing to follow the court's suggestion. See Foster v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/84/index.html">230 Ga. 186</a></span>, 187 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/84/index.html">195 SE2d 902</a></span>) (1973) (" 'A party cannot during the trial ignore what he thinks to be an injustice, take his chance on a favorable verdict, and complain later." '). Nor did AACCI point to anywhere in the transcript where the trial court prohibited Terefe from testifying as to why he denied the claim. See Egeh, 205 Ga. App. at 232 (7). Nor do we see where AACCI asserted that it should be permitted to present testimony on that issue separate and apart from the mass exhibit it proffered. Thus, notwithstanding AACCI's contention to the contrary, it was not deprived of an opportunity to fully defend itself. It alone decided not to present any evidence that the doctors who treated Olukoya overcharged or provided substandard or unnecessary medical treatment. It alone opted not to call any witnesses other than Terefe, and it alone chose not to elicit more information from him.</div><div class="casepar">Hotle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/11/index.html">222 Ga. App. 161</a></span>, 162 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/11/index.html">473 SE2d 256</a></span>) (1996) (evidence on appeal must be construed to uphold verdict). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying AACCI's motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">2. AACCI contends that the trial court committed reversible error by excluding its Exhibit 33. That document was a single hand-written page which purportedly indicates that Olukoya had a ganglion cyst of unknown origin at the time of his initial visit to Dr. Sheikholislam. The admissibility of this exhibit is controlled adversely to AACCI by the holding of Egeh, 205 Ga. App. at 231 (7). In that case, AACCI attempted to introduce the report of a physician's examination of the plaintiff which concluded that the plaintiff was not injured. AACCI wanted to offer the report for the limited purpose of showing its good faith in denying benefits. Id. We upheld the exclusion of the report made by a non-testifying physician. In this case, as we found in Giles v. Taylor, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../465/93/index.html">166 Ga. App. 563 (1) (305 SE2d 154) (1983)</a></span>, the exhibit was inadmissible hearsay</div><div class="casepar">3. Pretermitting whether dismissal is the appropriate remedy for alleged violations of Uniform Superior Court Rule ("USCR") 3.1, we find no merit to AACCI's contention that Olukoya wilfully violated this rule. Although the record does show that Olukoya dismissed his complaint in superior court and refiled in state court to avoid being forced to trial before he was ready, we do not find that this is the type of conduct USCR 3 was designed to prevent. Compare Hicks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/06/index.html">231 Ga. App. 552</a></span>, 555 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../252/06/index.html">499 SE2d 341</a></span>) (1998). The rule contemplates a system of assigning cases "designed to prevent any person's choosing the judge to whom an action is to be assigned. . . ." USCR 3.1. Although Olukoya's action affected the judge to whom the case was assigned, he did not attempt to choose the judge who would hear his case.</div><div class="casepar">Nor was the amount of attorney fees awarded erroneous. Notwithstanding AACCI's claim to the contrary, both of Olukoya's attorneys differentiated the time they devoted to prosecuting the bad faith claim and to the unsuccessful RICO claim. Both explicitly testified as to their exact time expended and their rates for billing that time.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A98A0572</div><div class="casepar">In a cross-appeal, Olukoya claims that he is entitled to post-trial attorney fees incurred in defending the judgment. We agree. All of the work done on a case of this type, including work done on appeal, may be considered in awarding attorney fees. First Financial In&amp; Co. v. Rainey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../362/12/index.html">195 Ga. App. 655</a></span>, 661 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../362/12/index.html">394 SE2d 774</a></span>) (1990), overruled on other grounds, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../355/2/index.html">261 Ga. 52 (401 SE2d 490) (1991)</a></span>. Consequently, we reverse the trial court's judgment denying post-trial attorney fees and direct the trial court to conduct further proceedings upon the return of the remittitur for the purpose of assessing such attorney fees.

      Although AACCI takes issue with the fact that Dr. Sheikholislam treated Olukoya with three injections of steroids, a review of the 46-count indictment shows that none of the counts involved the unlawful prescription of steroids. Many steroids, including ACTH, with which Olukoya was treated, are not regulated as controlled substances.
