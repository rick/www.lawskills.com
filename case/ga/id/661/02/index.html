(a) A contractual right being a property right, one may recover for an interference with his contractual relations by an act of another destroying property and so interfering with the performance of the contract. Thus, where it is alleged that plaintiff had contracted to build a bridge on the land of another and that defendant went upon the land and destroyed the work that plaintiff had accomplished in seeking to fulfill its contractual obligation, the petition sets out a cause of action although the plaintiff had no interest in the realty.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Where the act interfering with contractual relations is unlawful in itself, it is presumed that the wrongdoer intended to injure the plaintiff in its property right in the contract, as one must be presumed to intend the consequences of his unlawful conduct.</div><div class="casepar">(c) If a petition sets out a cause of action under any theory, it is error to dismiss the action on general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">2. It was not harmful error in this case to overrule a special demurrer complaining of failure to allege matters peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge.</div><div class="casepar">3, 4. Where the petition sets out an intentional tort, alleging that the injuries were done wilfully, wantonly, maliciously and in bad faith, it sets out causes of action for attorney's fees and for additional damages.</div><div class="casepar">H. W. Ivey Construction Company, Inc., filed its petition against T. W. Tift and Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc., alleging as follows:</div><div class="casepar">On November 21, 1961, General Warehouse 2, Inc., engaged the petitioner as a general contractor to construct an office building, a parking lot, paving and a bridge upon the land of General Warehouse 2, Inc. In the performance of its contract petitioner proceeded to build a concrete bridge across a stream that traversed a thirty by two hundred foot strip of land connecting the main body of the land with the public street. "Petitioner shows that it had excavated an area ten feet in width at a point where said stream crossed said strip and in which area concrete footing had been poured and your petitioner was then in the process of constructing three concrete re-enforced walls on said footing across which a concrete re-enforced slab was to be poured and would constitute a bridge over and across said stream and within said thirty foot strip . . . [O]n Friday evening, October 5, 1962, and after your petitioner's workmen, servants and employees had completed their work on said bridge for that day, the defendant, T. W. Tift, individually and as an officer of Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc., acting within the scope of his authority, did wilfully, wantonly and maliciously go on the property of the said General Warehouse 2, Inc., and with the use of a tractor and cable did tear down, demolish and destroy the work that had been done on said bridge by your petitioner . . . Petitioner was required at its expense to clear away the debris and reconstruct said bridge in substantially the same manner as had been originally constructed . . . [L]oss as above enumerated herein constitutes a direct and proximate loss suffered by your petitioner in that said work rendered by your petitioner for and in behalf of General Warehouse 2, Inc. is not acceptable by the owner (General Warehouse 2, Inc.) until and unless the same has been fully completed, approved and accepted by said owner."</div><div class="casepar">The petition prays for verdict and judgment against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of $2,558 for the actual labor and material in the re-construction of the bridge, $10,000 as punitive damages and $1,000 as attorney's fees.</div><div class="casepar">Each defendant filed several demurrers to the petition. Both defendants except to the order overruling their respective demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">1. The theory upon which the plaintiffs in error found this appeal as portrayed in their brief is that the suit against them is one for trespass to real estate neither owned nor possessed by the plaintiff and consequently the injury to the realty is a cause upon which the petitioner cannot sue. If the suit was in fact one for trespass under those circumstances, there would be, of course, nothing incorrect about their theory as a matter of abstract law. The theory, however, is not appropriate to this case.</div><div class="casepar">We readily concede that the petition is subject to the reasonable construction that the concrete footing and walls were a part of the realty when destroyed and that the plaintiff had no "possession" of the realty in the legal sense but had only a mere right of occupancy of the land and this not in its own right but only by virtue of the permission of the true owner. We even acknowledge that the petition does attempt to state a cause of action for damage to the realty. All these things, however, although definitely misleading, are not fatal to the petition, as it effectively delineates another cause of action--i. e., the petitioner did have an interest in property for damage to which he is entitled to recover. "If a petition sets out a cause of action under any theory it is error to dismiss the action, as against general demurrer." Childs v. Blaine, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../720/46/index.html">84 Ga. App. 847</a></span>, 850 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../720/46/index.html">67 SE2d 787</a></span>). The Childs principle would be true even though, as here, the pleading of the sound cause of action was more a product of coincidence or sheer accident than of the intent or design of the pleader.</div><div class="casepar">A contractual right is a right in rem, and the parties to a contract have a property right in the agreement. Luke v. DuPree, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 590 (124 SE 13)</span>; Wometco Theatres Inc. v. United Artists Corp., <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. App. 509 (186 SE 572)</span>; Carpenter v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">41 Ga. App. 685 (154 SE 298)</span>. "The right of enjoyment of private property being an absolute right of every citizen, every act of another which unlawfully interferes with such enjoyment is a tort for which an action shall lie." Code  105-1401.</div><div class="casepar">Since Lumley v. Gye, 2 Ed. and Bl. 216, 1 Eng. Rul. Cas. 706, a considerable body of law has grown up about the subject of interference with contractual relations. See Prosser, Torts (2d Ed. 1955), pp. 720-745. It has been substantially recognized in this State that interference with contractual relations by a third party, such as inducing one to breach his contract with another, is an actionable tort for which the party guilty is liable in damages. Luke v. DuPree, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 590</span>, supra; Darnell v. Toney, <span class="casemissing">39 Ga. App. 710 (148 SE 279)</span>; Studdard v. Evans, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../663/55/index.html">108 Ga. App. 819 (135 SE2d 60)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">As shown by the case of Southern R. Co. v. Chambers, <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 404</span> (<span class="casemissing">55 SE 37</span>, 7 LRA (NS) 926), the tort of the interference with contractual relations is not limited to the procurement of a breach of contract. We think the Chambers case is applicable to and controls the issue here. The holding in Chambers signifies that one under a duty to render a performance has a property interest in the contract in that he has the right to render the required performance free from unjustified and unprivileged intentional invasions that retard performance or make the performance more difficult or expensive. Interference of that type constitutes an actionable tort which embraces within its scope all intentional invasions of contractual relations, including any act injuring or destroying property and so interfering with the performance itself, regardless of whether breach of contract is induced. In this connection see 30 Am. Jur. 84, Interference,  42; 86 C.J.S., 959, Torts  44(a); Carpenter, "Interference with Contract Relations," 41 Harvard Law Review, p. 728.</div><div class="casepar">Interference with contractual relations is an intentional tort, and if intentional interference is to be required, it presupposes knowledge of the plaintiff's interests or, at least, of facts that would lead a reasonable man to believe in their existence. See Prosser, Torts (2d Ed. 1955), pp. 732-735.</div><div class="casepar">However, T. W. Tift's act of going upon the land of General Warehouse 2, Inc. and demolishing the work that had been accomplished on its bridge constitutes conduct unlawful in itself regardless of any specific intent to injure the petitioner in its contractual relations. Under the doctrine that one must be presumed to intend the consequences of his unlawful act, it must be accepted that Tift intended to injure the petitioner in its contractual relations.</div><div class="casepar">It is a question of fact, and thus for the jury, whether the defendant has played a material and substantial part in causing the plaintiff's loss of any benefits of the contract.</div><div class="casepar">General demurrers numbered 1 and 2 of each defendant were properly overruled by the court below.</div><div class="casepar">3. Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc.'s demurrer number 3 makes the objection that no cause of action for attorney's fees is set out. " Atlanta Journal Co. v. Doyal, [<span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/97/index.html">82 Ga. App. 321</a></span>, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/97/index.html">60 SE2d 802</a></span>], in effect holds that the wilful violations of the rights of another, every intentional tort, invokes the species of bad faith that under the provisions of Code  20-1404 entitles the person wronged to recover the expenses of litigation involving attorney's fees." Dodd v. Slater, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/99/index.html">101 Ga. App. 358</a></span>, 360 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/99/index.html">114 SE2d 167</a></span>). The petition alleges that the injuries complained of were done wilfully, wantonly and maliciously and in bad faith. It was not error to overrule this ground of demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">4. Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc.'s demurrer number 4 and T. W. Tift's demurrer number 5 both make the objection that no cause of action for punitive damages is set out. Code  105-2002 provides, "In every tort there may be aggravating circumstances, either in the act or the intention, and in that event the jury may give additional damages . . ." Under the above-noted allegations that the injuries were done wilfully, wantonly and maliciously and in bad faith, these demurrers were properly overruled.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed with directions that the petition be recast to eliminate the extraneous matter which seeks to recover for damage to the realty.
