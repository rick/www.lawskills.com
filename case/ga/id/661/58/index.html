Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Moore.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, Chief Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The evidence authorized the finding that the death of the employee did not result proximately from the accident from which his disability arose; therefore there is no liability for payment of the compensation provided in Code Ann.  114-413.</div><div class="casepar">2. The mere fact of the death of an employee to whom compensation was due at the time of his death does not authorize the filing of a claim by the widow and minor children for such compensation.</div><div class="casepar">This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court affirming an award of the State Board of Workmen's Compensation denying compensation to the plaintiffs in error, hereinafter called claimants. Claimants are the widow and three minor children of a deceased employee of defendant in error. Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. There was stipulated an agreement to pay compensation to the decedent from and including July 16, 1960, until terminated in accordance with the State Workmen's Compensation Law, for disability caused by an injury consisting of pulled back muscles, which occurred on July 9, 1960. There was evidence before the deputy director that decedent received compensation under the agreement and the award of the board based thereon through September 14, 1960, the payments having been discontinued when decedent returned to work for a few days at the same wage. Payments were not resumed when decedent quit work again, and he died on November 26, 1960. The hearing was held for the purpose of determining "liability, compensation, funeral expenses, medical, and dependency, and attorney's fees." The findings of the deputy director, which were adopted by the full board, included the following: That decedent's period of total disability ceased upon his return to work on August 9, 1960, and he did in fact undergo a change in condition on that date; that the burden was on the widow-claimant to show that decedent's death was related to the original injury; that the claimant failed to carry this burden, inasmuch as the medical testimony showed that the death was caused by cancer and was not accelerated or brought on by the accidental injury, therefore the claim was denied.</div><div class="casepar">1. Under the provisions of Code Ann.  114-413, recover of compensation depends, in a case such as this, upon proof that "during the period of disability caused by an accident death results proximately therefrom." The finding of the board that the death did not result proximately from the accident was authorized by the testimony and by the depositions of four doctors; therefore, in the absence of fraud, the finding and the award denying compensation under Code Ann.  114-413 are conclusive on this court.</div><div class="casepar">2. The award of the board denying recovery of compensation allegedly owed to the decedent under the original award for the period between the time he quit work, after having worked for several days, and his death, was correct, but for a reason other than that given, i.e., that his total disability ceased upon his return to work. "With reference to an award of compensation or an approved agreement this court has repeatedly held that such award or agreement is res judicata that the amount of the award or agreement is owed the employee until the award or agreement is changed in a manner prescribed by law. Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Shoemake, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/45/index.html">105 Ga. App. 432 (2) (124 SE2d 653)</a></span> and cases cited; Sanders v. American Mutual &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/57/index.html">105 Ga. App. 472 (1) (124 SE2d 923)</a></span> and cases cited. The rule is the same whether general disability Or injury to specific member alone is involved." Gentry v. Georgia Cas. &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../666/69/index.html">107 Ga. App. 888</a></span>, 889 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../666/69/index.html">131 SE2d 788</a></span>). "Although an employee who is receiving compensation payments under an agreement approved by the Board of Workmen's Compensation, or under an award of the board, continues to be entitled to such payments after he returns to work until and unless a change in or discontinuance of payments is authorized by order of the board, or until the statutory amount has been paid in full, or a final settlement receipt has been filed with and approved by the board, when the employee returns to his job or to a different job with his employer the employer is entitled to a credit for wages paid during the period of re-employment." Complete Auto Transit v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/73/index.html">106 Ga. App. 369 (1) (126 SE2d 909)</a></span>. Since none of the three possible conditions under which discontinuance of payment of compensation is authorized is shown to have existed, under the above authorities the defendants in error were liable for payments throughout flee period of re-employment and thereafter, with credit being allowed for payments made during the re-employment period. "Where, as here, the employee receives, during the period of re-employment a wage equal to or in excess of that which he was receiving at the time of his injury, the credit will fully offset any compensation due for that period." Complete Auto Transit v. Davis, supra (2). The liability terminated upon the decedent's death. "When an employee is entitled to compensation under this Title for an injury received, and death ensues from any cause not resulting from the injury for which he was entitled the compensation, payments of the unpaid balance for such injury shall cease and all liability therefor shall terminate." Code Ann.  114-413.</div><div class="casepar">Although the facts show liability for the unpaid balance of compensation, they do not give the claimants a right of action thereto. Under Code Ann.  113-901, the title to all property owned by a decedent, other than realty, "shall vest in the administrator of his estate for the benefit of the heirs and creditors." "As a general rule, heirs at law cannot maintain suit on a chose in action in favor of the intestate, and such suit can be brought only by the administrator, except where special circumstances exist. Carter v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. App. 73 (138 SE 915)</span>; Brown v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., <span class="casemissing">146 Ga. 123</span>, 124 (<span class="casemissing">90 SE 856</span>). 'At the death of the owner the title to any personal property vests in the administrator of his estate for the benefit of the heirs and creditors . . . If personal property is held adversely to an estate which has no legal representative, the only legal way to recover it is to have an administrator appointed and have him bring suit in his name as such representative. This is true although all the heirs are sui juris and no debts existed against the estate. The same rule applies to the collection of any indebtedness due the estate. If the heirs were to bring suit against a debtor of the estate, their allegations that the estate owed no debts and that no necessity existed for the administration of the estate would be no protection to such defendant if debts were later discovered and an administrator appointed. So, for the protection of all parties, if any assets are to be collected for an estate, the collection should be made by a duly constituted representative.' Redfearn on Wills and Administration of Estates, 428,  247." Bennett v. Bottoms, <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. App. 456</span>, 457 (<span class="casemissing">13 SE2d 519</span>). See also Smith v. Turner, <span class="casemissing">112 Ga. 533 (37 SE 705)</span>; Moughon v. Masterson, <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 699 (79 SE 561)</span>; Hill v. Maffett, <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. App. 89 (59 SE 325)</span>. Code Ann.  113-1232 provides a procedure for dispensing with administration under certain circumstances by petition to the ordinary, but such proceeding was not shown to have been followed, and hence cannot be assumed, in this case. There is no provision in our Workmen's Compensation Law for recovery of a decedent's unpaid compensation by his heirs at law. This court held, in Savannah Lumber Co. v. Burch, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 621 (137 SE 786)</span>, that a petition by the widow of an injured employee, to recover from the employer a balance of compensation due on an award where the insurer was insolvent, was good as against a general demurrer, to wit: That said petition "fails to set forth any cause of action or any right to summary or remedial relief against defendant." The Supreme Court, in affirming the case on certiorari. ruled that the demurrer "was properly overruled, because, if for any reason the petitioner is not entitled to the relief she seeks, the demurrer is too general to call attention to the specific point, and a special demurrer was required to point out distinctly and particularly such defect." Savannah Lumber Co. v. Burch, <span class="casemissing">165 Ga. 706</span>, 708 (<span class="casemissing">142 SE 83</span>). By contrast, counsel for defendants in error in the present case raised the point that "any claim in the original case would have to be in the name of his administrator or his executor," stating further that the employee's claim and a claim for his death could not be tried as one case unless by agreement and that he did not so agree.</div><div class="casepar">For the reasons herein above stated the court did not err in its judgment affirming the award of the full board denying compensation in any form to the claimants.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
