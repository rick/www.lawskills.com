Fulton Civil Court. Before Judge Wright.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, Chief Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Although the defendant wife signed a note as an apparent principal, she could be found by the trior of fact not to be a maker thereon, where the evidence showed that the loan was made to her now deceased husband for exclusive use in his business, in which she had no financial interest, that she received none of the proceeds of the loan, and that the plaintiff considered the note as security for post-dated checks given him by the husband.</div><div class="casepar">1. Cohen brought suit against Mrs. Dorothy S. Gotlieb, a/k/a Mrs. Sam Gotlieb, for the balance allegedly due him on a promissory note. The petition alleged that the defendant and her deceased husband jointly and severally executed the note, payable to the plaintiff; that only three of the ninety-two installments of the note have been paid; that the defendant refuses to pay the balance upon demand. The defendant's answer alleged that the loan evidenced by the note was made to her deceased husband for use in his jewelry business; that it was so used by him; that she signed the note purely as surety for her husband and did not receive any of the proceeds thereof, of which facts the plaintiff was aware when the note was given; that she was not a partner with her late husband in his jewelry business. The case was tried before the court without the intervention of a jury. At the close of the evidence the court rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial on the general grounds, which was overruled, to which judgment the plaintiff excepts.</div><div class="casepar">"Where the wife signs the note as an apparent principal, the burden is on her to prove that she signed as surety only, and that the payee of the note, with knowledge of the facts which would constitute her a surety, contracted with her as a surety." Lovelady v. Moss, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 652</span>, 653 (<span class="casemissing">179 SE 168</span>); Dye v. Richards, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../187/18/index.html">210 Ga. 601</a></span>, 602 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../187/18/index.html">81 SE2d 820</a></span>), and cases cited. We think that the assumption that the defendant signed as a maker, arising from her signature on the face of the note under that of her husband without any designation of the capacity in which she signed, could be found to have been rebutted by the evidence in the case. The note, attached as an exhibit, stated that "I promise to pay, etc.", rather than we promise. The defendant's husband was the one who gave the plaintiff the checks and to whom the plaintiff gave the money. The plaintiff testified that Mr. Gotlieb offered him a number of post-dated checks on his business checking account to secure a loan, but that the plaintiff refused to accept the checks alone, insisting that "I rather have a note and agreement with he [sic] and his wife and, of course, he and his wife both then, of course, to make the payments to back up the checks. That was the whole agreement. So when he brought the note over I saw both of them signed it, went to the bank, took the money out, and paid it to them." (Emphasis supplied.) This evidence would support the theory that the plaintiff regarded the checks as the primary obligation, the note being security to "back up the checks." On the other hand, the plaintiff testified that his reason for insisting upon the defendant's signature on the note was his understanding that it was a family business. The evidence being conflicting, the judge was authorized to make the finding, based upon the foregoing evidence, that Mr. Gotlieb was the principal on the note and that the defendant, whose signature was affixed only upon the plaintiff's insistence, was merely a surety.</div><div class="casepar">The general rule in this State as to a wife's suretyship is that she may not bind her separate estate by any contract of suretyship nor by any assumption of the debts of her husband. Code  53-503. "Where a joint note is executed by a husband and wife for a consideration of money or goods afterwards to be advanced or furnished by the payee, in the absence of a partnership undertaking between husband and wife, 'the wife is bound only to the extent of so much of the consideration as she afterwards receives.' Dobbins v. Blanchard, <span class="casemissing">94 Ga. 500 (21 SE 215)</span>; Harrell v. Swift, <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. App. 73 (138 SE 916)</span>." Daniel v. G. Ober &amp; Sons Co., <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 691 (3) (184 SE 439)</span>. The evidence as to whether or not the defendant was a partner in the business consisted of her testimony that her husband owned the business; that she had helped him "a few hours a day" during his lifetime; that she had had no financial interest in the business and never received a salary therefrom. Concerning receipt of any consideration of the note, the defendant testified that she had written only one check--for her personal clothing--on the business bank account in which the loan had been deposited; that she never received any of the proceeds of the loan; that she claimed year's support and took possession of the business after her husband's death. "The fact that on the subsequent death of the husband some part of or benefit from the consideration, which had been received entirely by him from the payee, may accrue to the wife under an allowance to her of a year's support from the husband's estate, will not alter the rule." Daniel v. G. Ober &amp; Sons Co., supra, (3). "If, with the knowledge of the payee, the entire consideration is to go only to the husband, and passes only to him, the husband 'is the real primary debtor, and the wife (being) in the position of a surety,' is not liable for any part of the joint note. McRitchie v. Atlanta Trust Co., <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 296</span>, 310 (<span class="casemissing">152 SE 834</span>); Evans v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">47 Ga. App. 351 (3)</span>, 353 (<span class="casemissing">170 SE 541</span>)." Daniel v. G. Ober &amp; Sons Co., supra, (3). Although the plaintiff may not have had actual notice of the fact that the defendant was not a partner in her husband's business and that the entire consideration was to go only to the husband, the evidence shows that he had sufficient notice under the law. "Notice sufficient to excite attention and put a party on inquiry shall be notice of everything to which it is afterwards found such inquiry might have led. Ignorance of a fact, due to negligence, shall be equivalent to knowledge, in fixing the rights of parties." Code  37-116. The plaintiff testified that, based solely on information received from his brother, he understood that the defendant and her late husband ran the business together as a "family business," although he hardly knew Mr. Gotlieb, never saw the defendant until after her husband's death, and made no investigation as to her interest in the business.</div><div class="casepar">In ruling on the general grounds of a motion for a new trial, the judgment on a trial without a jury will not be disturbed where it is supported by some evidence. See cases annotated under Code  70-202, catchword "Judge." There was sufficient evidence, as shown hereinabove, to authorize the judge to find that the loan was made to the defendant's husband for exclusive use in his business, of which he had the sole ownership and interest, that the defendant received none of the proceeds of the loan, and that the defendant's signing of the note was as security for the husband's checks and was therefore ineffectual to bind her with liability there for under the authorities cited herein.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the evidence supported the judgment in favor of the defendant and that the court did not err in its judgment overruling the motion for a new trial on the general grounds.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Harold Karp, A.
