Fulton State Court. Before Judge Baxter.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On or about October 15, 1994, plaintiffs/appellants Masuo and Chiyo Kondo, husband and wife, went to defendant Marietta Toyota Inc.'s dealership ("Marietta Toyota") to look at cars. Because plaintiffs were Japanese and limited in their ability to read and understand written English, they brought a friend with them to act as interpreter. After plaintiffs selected a 1994 Toyota Previa van, they were taken to the manager's office to sign paperwork. During that time, they became separated from their interpreter who had gone to another office to help obtain verification of plaintiffs' automobile insurance.</div><div class="casepar">Although plaintiffs contend it was their belief they were purchasing rather than leasing the vehicle, the document they signed was clearly labeled "Closed End Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement." The lease agreement required plaintiffs to pay Marietta Toyota, as lessor, a non-refundable cash payment of $4,000 and thereafter 60 monthly payments of $387.44 each, equaling $23,246.40. Thus, the total of plaintiffs' payments under the lease was $27,246.40. The lease document also specifically provided that Marietta Toyota would be assigning the lease and vehicle to defendant VT Inc., as Trustee for defendant World Omni Financial Corporation (collectively "WOFC"), and plaintiffs acknowledged and agreed to that assignment.</div><div class="casepar">The lease agreement listed the vehicle as "new" but also disclosed that the mileage on the odometer at the time of the transfer was 6,650 miles. This same mileage was listed on the Odometer Disclosure Statement also signed by plaintiffs. Additionally, plaintiffs signed an "Acknowledgment of Disclosure by Dealer of Damage to Motor Vehicle" which stated that the vehicle had been previously damaged and received repairs totaling $1,912.35. The record revealed that although the van had never been titled to any person other than Marietta Toyota, it had been used as a demonstrator by the dealership. The vehicle was being driven by the wife of one of Marietta Toyota's sales managers at the time it sustained damage.</div><div class="casepar">In May 1995, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the State Court of Fulton County, alleging violations of the federal Consumer Leasing Act (Count 1) and the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act (Count 2).</div><div class="casepar">After defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs amended their complaint, adding a count seeking rescission of the lease on the grounds of unconscionability (Count 3) as well as a claim for attorney fees and expenses (Count 4). They also filed a motion to strike the only affidavit filed by defendants in support of their motif for summary judgment. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion to strike and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs now bring this appeal alleging four enumerations of error.</div><div class="casepar">1. Plaintiffs first allege the trial court erred in ruling that the federal Consumer Leasing Act ("CLA") did not apply in this case because the total amount of plaintiffs' payments under the lease was $27,246.40, exceeding the $25,000 jurisdictional ceiling imposed by the Act.</div><div class="casepar">The CLA applies to leases of personal property "for a total contractual obligation not exceeding $25,000. . . ." 15 USCA  1667 (1) Although the term "total contractual obligation" is not defined in the CLA or in any of its regulations, federal courts have held that with respect to closed-end leases, the term "total contractual obligation includes the total of all monthly payments due under a vehicle lease as well as any non-refundable cash payments made at the inception of the lease. Easterwood v. General Elec. Capital Auto Lease, 825 FSupp. 306, 310 (N.D. Ga. 1993). See also Sanders v. Gold Key Lease, 906 FSupp. 197 (SDNY 1995).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, plaintiffs' total contractual obligation consisted of the $4,000 non-refundable cash payment paid at the time the entered into the lease plus $23,246.40 in monthly installments, totalling $27,246.40. "As such, the lease in issue does not come within the reach of the Consumer Leasing Act and, therefore, is not unlawful and void under federal law." Easterwood v. General Elec. Capital Auto Lease, 825 FSupp. at 310.</div><div class="casepar">2. Plaintiffs next allege the trial court erred in ruling that their van, which was leased to them as "new" but had been driven 6,650 miles and had been involved in a collision, was a "new" car.</div><div class="casepar">Georgia's Used Motor Vehicle Dealers' and Used Motor Vehicle Parts Dealers' Registration Act (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/47/1/index.html">43-47-1</a></span> et seq.) defines a "used motor vehicle" or "used car" as any motor vehicle or car other than a motor vehicle which has never been the subject of a retail sale by a new motor vehicle dealer or a used motor vehicle dealer which is the subject of a retail sale to a consumer for his or her own use or of a resale to another licensed dealer." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/47/2/index.html">43-47-2</a></span> (16). The Georgia statute that governs the identification of and purchase and resale of motor vehicles and parts (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/4/1/index.html">40-4-1</a></span> et seq.) defines a "new passenger car as "any passenger car which has never been the subject of a sale at retail to the general public." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/40/4/1/index.html">40-4-1</a></span> (2). And the Georgia Motor Vehicle Warranty Rights Act (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/10/1/780/index.html">10-1-780</a></span> et seq.) considers a "new motor vehicle" as one "that was leased or purchased in this state or registered by the original consumer in this state and on which the original motor vehicle title was issued to the lessor or purchaser without having been previously issued to any person other than the selling dealer. . . . The term 'new motor vehicle' includes a demonstrator or lease-purchase, as long as a manufacturer's warranty was issued as a condition of sale, unless specifically excluded under this definition." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/10/1/782/index.html">10-1-782</a></span> (11).</div><div class="casepar">Because plaintiffs' van was always titled in Marietta Toyota and was never before the subject of a retail sale or lease to a consumer, it clearly fit the statutory definition of a "new car" under Georgia law. Therefore, Marietta Toyota did not engage in a fraudulent or unfair business practice by listing the vehicle as "new" on the lease agreement. See Toirkens v. Willett Toyota, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/47/index.html">192 Ga. App. 109</a></span>, 110 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/47/index.html">384 SE2d 218</a></span>) (1989).</div><div class="casepar">Relying on Bennett v. D. L. Claborn Buick, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/47/index.html">202 Ga. App. 308 (2) (414 SE2d 12) (1991)</a></span>, plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding the foregoing statutory provisions, the question of whether the vehicle delivered to plaintiffs was "new" was one of fact for the jury because "it may be considered an intrinsic quality of a car sold as new that it has been neither damaged nor used to any significant extent." (Citations, punctuation and emphasis omitted.) Bennett at 309. However, in Bennett, the vehicle at issue was represented by the sales person to be "new" in the sense of it never having been significantly driven, and the plaintiffs in that instance had no actual knowledge that the vehicle had been used as a demonstrator. In this case, the vehicle leased by plaintiffs was not represented to be "new" in the sense of not having been damaged nor used to any significant extent. Rather, it was listed as "new" in compliance with Georgia law because the vehicle had not been the subject of a previous sale or lease. Additionally, in this case, plaintiffs signed three separate documents stating the exact extent of the vehicle's previous use and the extent of the collision damage that resulted from that use. Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs' claims under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act. See Henderson v. Martin Burks Chevrolet, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/49/index.html">183 Ga. App. 868 (1) (360 SE2d 430) (1987)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. Plaintiffs next allege the trial court erred when it denied their motion to strike the only affidavit submitted by defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment. However, plaintiffs' argument that the affidavit was defective because it did not specifically recite that it was made from the affiant's personal knowledge is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Defendants presented the sworn statement of Marietta Toyota's general manager setting forth his title and responsibilities and attaching those documents relevant to plaintiffs' leasing of the vehicle. The affidavit specifically recited that each of the documents in question was made and kept in the ordinary course of business of Marietta Toyota. "Since OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/14/index.html">24-3-14</a></span> (b) specifically provides that a proper business record is 'admissible in evidence in proof of the act, transaction, occurrence, or event'. . . , we find no merit in [plaintiffs'] argument that [defendants'] affidavit was insufficient because it failed to reflect the affiant's personal knowledge [of this lease transaction]." Intl. Business Consulting v. First Union Nat. Bank of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../373/80/index.html">192 Ga. App. 742</a></span>, 743 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../373/80/index.html">386 SE2d 400</a></span>) (1989). Additionally, the information contained in the affidavit is consistent with and cumulative of deposition testimony and other evidence contained in the record and was uncontroverted by plaintiffs. Therefore, it was not error for the trial court to deny plaintiffs' motion to strike the affidavit. Lott v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../513/22/index.html">154 Ga. App. 474 (2) (268 SE2d 686) (1980)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. Plaintiffs lastly argue the trial court's grant of summary judgment on Count 3 of plaintiffs' amended complaint alleging unconscionable conduct under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/11/2A/108/index.html">11-2A-108</a></span> was premature because the amended complaint was filed just two days before the hearing on defendants' original motion for summary judgment, and the issue of unconscionability had not been briefed by the parties.</div><div class="casepar">Our review of the transcript of the hearing reveals that when defendants' counsel asked the court to grant summary judgment on all counts contained in plaintiffs' amended complaint, plaintiffs' attorney failed to raise any objections and instead chose to argue the merits of the unconscionability claim. We find, therefore, that plaintiffs have waived any defect as to the timeliness of the granting of summary judgment on their amended complaint. See Mobley v. Coast House, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/56/index.html">182 Ga. App. 305</a></span>, 309 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/56/index.html">355 SE2d 686</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, we need not address the merits of plaintiffs' unconscionability claim or the jurisdiction of the State Court to grant the relief sought by plaintiffs in Count 3 of the amended complaint.</div><div class="casepar">Awtrey &amp; Parker, Toby B.
