It provided coverage up to 50 percent of the stated limits as a part of the "total contributing insurance." There was a similar policy issued by General Fire &amp; Casualty Company for like amounts and upon identical terms providing coverage for the same period, issued through the same agency.</div><div class="casepar">Each policy provided for an extension of coverage to newly acquired personal property, "up to 10 percent of the limits of liability specified for Coverage B-Personal Property, but not exceeding $10,000, to cover business personal property acquired by the insured at any other location used by him for mercantile or warehouse purposes, within the territorial limits of this policy. This extension of coverage shall cease 30 days from the date of such acquisition, or on the date values of such acquisition are reported to the company, whichever first occurs. Additional premium for acquired locations shall be due and payable for values so reported computed from the date of such acquisition. This extension does not apply to property in transit."</div><div class="casepar">Star leased a fifth location and began placing merchandise (photo flash bulbs) in it. Lanier learned of this and telephoned Star asking for the values of merchandise in the new location, but Star did not report them, informing Lanier that it had decided to place the insurance with another agency and company. However, on the morning of September 28, 1963, at about 8 a.m., the roof of the new location fell in, due to faulty design and construction a peril insured against.</div><div class="casepar">Star filed proof of loss with General Fire &amp; Casualty Company for the portion of the loss covered under its policy, but there was never any written notice from Star to Buffalo of the loss and no proof of loss was ever filed with it, although the policy provided that: "The insured shall give immediate written notice to this company of any loss, . . . furnish a complete inventory of the destroyed, damaged and undamaged property, showing in detail quantities, costs, actual cash value and amount of the loss claimed; and within 60 days after the loss, unless such time is extended in writing by this company, the insured shall render to this company a proof of loss, signed and sworn to by the insured, stating the knowledge and belief of the insured as to the following: the time and origin of the loss, the interest of the insured and of all others in the property, the actual cash value on each item thereof and the loss there to, all encumbrances thereon, and all other contracts of insurance, whether valid or not, covering any of said property, any changes in the title, use, occupation, location, possession or exposures of said property since the issuing of this policy." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">There was further provision that: "The amount of loss for which this company may be liable shall be payable sixty days after proof of loss, as herein provided, is received by the company and ascertainment of the loss is made either by agreement or between the insured and this company expressed in writing, or by the filing with this company of an award as herein provided.</div><div class="casepar">"No suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within 12 months next after inception of the loss." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff filed suit September 25, 1964, three days before expiration of the 12 months following the occasion of the loss, alleging that the policy had been lost and that it could not, therefore, attach a copy, but that demand for payment of the loss had been made on the company and that the company had refused to pay. By amendment it was alleged that Buffalo had intentionally concealed itself from the plaintiff and that the demand for payment of the loss was made about 11 months after it occurred and that the refusal was in bad faith. The testimony of plaintiff's attorney who made the demand was that it was made September 22, 1964--only three days before suit was filed, when he was informed by Buffalo's agent that his demand would have to be submitted to the company for its consideration.</div><div class="casepar">Buffalo admitted that it learned of the loss some time between October 13, 1963, and December 16, 1963, when it received information from Mr. Charles Hurst, an adjuster who was handling the claim for General Fire, relative to a letter which Mr. Walter Calhoun, attorney for Star, had written to General Fire, and that it received from the adjuster a copy of an investigation report made to General Fire relative to the loss on November 13, 1963, but denied that it ever received proofs of loss or copies thereof which may have been made to General Fire by Star, and asserted that at the time it learned of the loss in this manner and received a copy of the adjuster's investigation report Buffalo had received no communication of any kind relative to the loss from Star and had received from it no notice of any claim which Star intended to make on account of the loss.</div><div class="casepar">Motions for summary judgment were denied and the case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant, Buffalo, appeals from a denial of its motion for new trial and for judgment n.o.v., and plaintiff cross appeals from a pre-trial order limiting the liability under the policy to $5,000 and from the sustaining of a motion for directed verdict against the plaintiff on the issue of bad faith penalties and attorneys' fees.</div><div class="casepar">1. All of the issues in both the appeal and the cross appeal can be disposed of by a ruling on the matter of whether the suit was maintainable, plaintiff not having given written notice of the loss <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> and not having filed any proof of loss at any time prior thereto.</div><div class="casepar">1. (a) Although plaintiff seeks to rely upon an oral demand <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> made by its counsel upon a representative of the insurance company some three days prior to the filing of suit, and six days prior to the expiration of the 12-month policy limitation for the bringing of suit, and upon the company's alleged refusal to pay the amount of the demand, this can not avail. "The statutory demand for payment of the proceeds of an insurance policy must be made at a time when a demand for immediate payment is in order. It is not in order if the insurer, under the terms of the insurance policy, has additional time left in which to investigate or adjust the loss and therefore has no legal duty to pay at the time the demand is made."

Notice required under contract provisions or under statutory provisions is generally effective when given in the form, at the time and in the manner required. Cf. Rogers v.

Napp v. American Cas. Co., supra, p. 675.</div><div class="casepar">(b) While it is true that when, as here, the policy contains no provision making the policy void upon failure of the insured to furnish proof of loss within 60 days after the loss, yet if the proof is not furnished within the 60 days as called for, a refusal of the insurer to pay after expiration of that time will not operate as a waiver of the proofs. Newark Fire Ins. Co. v. Reese, <span class="casemissing">32 Ga. App. 42 (123 SE 41)</span>; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Sailors, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga.

Hunnicutt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../665/01/index.html">107 Ga. App. 366 (1) (130 SE2d 239)</a></span>. Further, failure to furnish proofs of loss before expiration of twelve months from the date of the loss will prevent the maintenance of a suit on the policy. Harp v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">130 Ga. 726</span> (<span class="casemissing">61 SE 704</span>, 14 AC 299); Southern Fire Ins. Co. v. Knight, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 622</span> (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 821</span>, 52 LRA 70, 78 ASR 216). It is admitted that no proof of loss was ever filed with Buffalo.</div><div class="casepar">2. (a) Although Star alleges that it demanded payment of the loss, and that the demand was refused, its attorney, who made the demand, testified that when he made the demand the agent informed him that the demand would have to be referred to the company for its consideration and action, whereupon he told the agent that he could not await the delay which that would entail inasmuch as he had only five or six days in which to institute suit under the provision of the policy requiring that suit be brought within twelve months after the date of the loss, and that he proceeded with the filing of suit to avoid the bar. Thus, there was a failure to prove that there had been any denial of the demand by the company. There was an admission in Buffalo's answer that there had been a demand and denial, but by amendment that was stricken and it was alleged instead that no demand for payment was made on Buffalo until the suit was filed, and thus there had been no refusal to pay the loss, and further that it does refuse to pay the loss because no proof of loss was ever made and because the loss was not one covered by the policy. Its attorney testified that this had been the purport of the answer as originally filed, and that the amendment was a clarification. The amendment is consistent with plaintiff's proof.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Was there "notice in writing" of the loss within the requirement of the policy, or the contemplation of Code Ann.  56-2427? We think not. The policy provides that "The insured shall give immediate written notice to this company of any loss. . ." Certainly it cannot be said that this requirement is met when the company gets information in some other manner and from some other source. Suppose there had been a news story of the loss in a newspaper to which the company was a subscriber and which those in charge of its office read. While it night be said to have been "in writing" it could not be said to have been given by the insured or to have been directed to the company. Moreover, even the giving of notice does not dispense with the necessity of making proof of loss (Styles v. American Home Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">146 Ga. 92</span> (1a) (<span class="casemissing">90 SE 718</span>)), unless the company fails to supply forms as required by Code Ann.  56-2427, nor does the fact that the insurer has knowledge of the loss relieve the insured of making proof of loss under terms of the policy. Code Ann.  56-2428 (3); Nalley v. Hanover Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 555</span>, 567 (<span class="casemissing">193 SE 619</span>).</div><div class="casepar">(c) But Star contends that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the communications between Mr. Hurst, the adjuster for General Fire, and Buffalo to authorize the jury to find that he was acting as Buffalo's agent in sending the copies of investigative reports, etc., to it and thus, that when proofs of loss for General Fire were delivered to him this sufficiently complied with the policy provision requiring notice of the loss to Buffalo, placing a duty on it under Code Ann.  56-2427 to send to Star forms for making proof of loss, in default of which the proofs were waived.</div><div class="casepar">The trouble with this contention is that when Star prepared and filed with Hurst proofs of loss directed to General Fire it was not and did not purport to be dealing with him as Buffalo's agent. Indeed, Mr. Starnes testified that Star did not learn of the Buffalo policy, and consequently of its claim against Buffalo, until Mr. Calhoun went to the office of the southern regional adjuster for Buffalo on September 22, 1964, and was shown a copy of the policy. It was not, therefore, relying upon any agency relationship between Hurst and Buffalo when the proofs for General Fire were delivered to him months before. There were no negotiations between them relative to Star's claim against Buffalo; indeed the matter was never discussed or mentioned.</div><div class="casepar">"The rule that a principal is bound to the extent of the authority which he has apparently conferred upon his agent has no reference to a situation in which a person affected by the acts of the agent does not deal with the agent in reliance upon the authority which the principal has apparently conferred upon him." Piedmont Operating Co. v. Cumming, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 397 (1) (149 SE 814)</span>. "To create an estoppel by conduct of the principal it must be shown that the complaining party dealt with the supposed agent in reliance upon the authority which the principal apparently conferred upon him, and changed his position as a result of such reliance." National Homes, Inc. v. City Plumbing &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/66/index.html">108 Ga. App. 519 (133 SE2d 416)</a></span>. Accord: Patterson v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casemissing">41 Ga. App. 94 (1) (151 SE 818)</span>; Equitable Credit Corp. v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../716/42/index.html">86 Ga. App. 844</a></span>, 847 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../716/42/index.html">72 SE2d 816</a></span>). There is simply no proof in the record that Star ever dealt with Hurst as Buffalo's agent, or in reliance upon any apparent authority to him from Buffalo; its only dealings with him were relative to a claim against General Fire. It must appear that the person to whom notice of the loss was given was an agent authorized to receive notice or proof of loss in behalf of the company (Bailey v. First Nat. Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. App. 213 (89 SE 80)</span>), or one having apparent authority upon which there was reliance, and that does not appear.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Star contends that a waiver should result from the fact that Buffalo received information from General Fire relative to the occurrence of the loss and copies of reports made to General Fire from time to time by its claims investigator and attorney and, having that information in hand, nevertheless failed to call on Star for proofs of loss or attempt to make settlement of the loss with it. The collection of information or the making of an investigation relative to a loss that may be covered under a policy issued by a company does not work a waiver of the policy requirements and compliance therewith by the insured. Code Ann.  56-2428 (3); Smith v. Western Assur. Co. of Canada, <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. App. 461 (89 SE2d 533)</span>; Nalley v. Hanover Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 555</span>, 567, supra. Cf. Allen v. City of Macon, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../632/17/index.html">118 Ga. App. 88 (162 SE2d 783)</a></span>; Schaefer v. Mayor &amp;c. of Athens, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../626/55/index.html">120 Ga. App. 301 (6)</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">(e) There is no merit in the contention that Buffalo should have called on Star to make claim against it. Star had been requested by Buffalo's agent to furnish information relative to the property so that it might be added to the policy for coverage, and Star had refused to give the information, saying that it had decided to place the insurance elsewhere. Buffalo might well have concluded that no claim would ever be made against it. Further, insurance is a matter of contract (North British &amp; Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tye, <span class="casemissing">1 Ga. App. 380 (58 SE 110)</span>), and under the unambiguous provisions of this policy it is the duty of the insured to present its claim to the company and make the required proof thereof. Until that is done neither the contract nor the law (save in situations covered by Code Ann.  56-2427) imposes a duty on the company to do anything. Indeed, the contract, unless contrary to statutory provision or public policy, is the law that governs. St. Paul Fire &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. C. I. T. Corp., <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 101</span>, 103 (<span class="casemissing">189 SE 390</span>); Ga. Power Co. v. City of Decatur, <span class="casemissing">168 Ga. 705 (2) (149 SE 32)</span>; West View Corp. v. Alston, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/49/index.html">208 Ga. 122</a></span>, 127 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/49/index.html">65 SE2d 406</a></span>). The insured is in a better position than the company to know when he has suffered a loss and it is for him to determine whether and when he will make a claim under the policy. General American Life Ins. Co. v. Butts, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 350 (1) (18 SE2d 542)</span>; Sovereign Camp of the W.O.W. v. Cooper, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 208 (1) (21 SE2d 410)</span>; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 245 (1) (172 SE 654)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. Nor does the fact that plaintiff had lost or misplaced the policy excuse it from complying with its terms in this respect. Milwaukee Ins. Co. v. Powell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../661/12/index.html">108 Ga. App. 12 (132 SE2d 95)</a></span>. Cf. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Sailors, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 628</span>, 632, supra.</div><div class="casepar">4. (a) "It was the misfortune of the insured that he so long delayed that, at the time he was aroused to action, he did not have time sufficient to submit his proofs of loss at least sixty days before the expiration of the twelve months within which he could bring his action in the event the company declined to pay the loss." Graham v. Niagara Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">106 Ga. 840</span>, 842 (<span class="casemissing">32 SE 579</span>). And see Ritch v. Masons' Fraternal Acc. Assn. of America, <span class="casemissing">99 Ga. 112 (25 SE 191)</span>; United Benevolent Soc. v. Freeman, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 355 (36 SE 764)</span>; Southern Fire Ins. Co. v. Knight, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 622 (1)</span> (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 821</span>, 52 LRA 70, 78 ASR 216).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Absent a waiver, the furnishing of the proof of loss as required by the policy is a condition precedent to the accrual of liability on the part of the company and to the institution of suit by the insured. National Life Ins. Co. v. Jordan, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 647 (94 SE 862)</span>; Jones v. Pacific Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 128 (119 SE 922)</span>; Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Milton, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 634 (2) (127 SE 798)</span>; Mutual Benefit Health &amp;c. Assn. v.

App. 12</a></span>, 16 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../661/12/index.html">132 SE2d 95</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">(c) The refusal of Buffalo to pay the amount claimed for the loss does not estop it from defending on this ground. "[I]t is the well-settled rule in this State that, where notice of loss or injury, or proofs thereof, have not been given or furnished in accordance with provisions of the policy requiring the same as conditions precedent to liability, the company's subsequent absolute refusal to pay because of the non-compliance with such provisions, or for some other reason, will not estop the company from setting up as a defense the failure of the insured to make such reports [citations]." Barkley v. American Nat. Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 447 (2) (136 SE 803)</span>; Great Eastern Cas. Co. v. Reed, <span class="casemissing">17 Ga.

Young Shoe Parlor, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 402</span>, 404 (<span class="casemissing">104 SE 429</span>). Nor does it amount to a waiver of the requirement for the furnishing of proofs of loss. Phenix Ins. Co. v. Searles, <span class="casemissing">100 Ga. 97 (4) (27 SE 779)</span>; Newark Fire Ins. Co. v. Reese, <span class="casemissing">32 Ga. App. 42 (123 SE 41)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">We find nothing in this record to authorize a finding of any waiver by Buffalo of the policy provisions, or of anything that would work an estoppel against it to plead and rely upon them as a defense. It is conceded that no proof of loss was ever furnished to the company. In this situation the suit was not maintainable and no verdict against the company could stand, for a condition precedent to a fixing of liability has not been met. Guarantee &amp;c. Life Ins. Co. v. Norris, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../162/16/index.html">219 Ga. 573</a></span>, 575 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../162/16/index.html">134 SE2d 774</a></span>); Styles v.
