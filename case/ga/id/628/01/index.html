Clarke Superior Court. Before Judge Barrow.</div><div class="casepresiding">JORDAN, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in denying the Board of Regents' motion to intervene to assert subrogation under the workmen's compensation law in an action by the claimant against an uninsured motorist carrier.</div><div class="casepar">Merritt C. Oelke was killed in an automobile collision on May 17, 1967. At the time he was a guest passenger in an automobile owned and operated by Fred D. Holt, who had insurance coverage with State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, including coverage against losses caused by uninsured motorists. Oelke's widow, Mrs. Bernice K. Oelke, brought an action for the wrongful death of her husband in Morgan Superior Court against one motorist and the legal representative of the estate of another who was killed in the collision. She obtained a judgment for $31,500. She then filed a complaint against State Farm Mutual Insurance Company in Clarke Superior Court in which she alleges that the judgment is unpaid, that the tortfeasors are uninsured, and that State Farm is indebted to her for $10,000 by reason of its uninsured motorist coverage applicable to her late husband. The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia moved to intervene in the action as a party plaintiff, alleging in its complaint that it was Oelke's employer, that his death arose out of and in the course of his employment, that pursuant to an agreement approved by the State Board of Workmen's Compensation it became obligated to make workmen's compensation payments to Mrs. Oelke, including periodic payments not to exceed $12,500, plus medical and funeral expenses, for which it is subrogated against the net recovery of the plaintiff from the defendant, and that the plaintiff through her attorney has refused to recognize the validity of any lien under Code Ann.  114-403 against her net recovery, and will refuse to pay the same. The intervention asks that the plaintiff be ordered to pay the intervenor the amount of the net recovery to which it is entitled by law. As a matter of defensive pleading to the original action State Farm contends, among other things, that its liability could not in any event exceed $10,000 which is less than the amounts paid to the plaintiff and the present value of amounts payable under the Workmen's Compensation law, by reason of which the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff in any amount.</div><div class="casepar">The Board of Regents appeals from the order of the trial court denying to it the right to intervene, which the trial court denied for the stated reasons that the motion to intervene and proposed complaint fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and that the movant has no present or potential interest. The court in its order also expressly states that the motion was denied not as an exercise of discretion but as a requirement of law.</div><div class="casepar">1. Code Ann.  114-403 provides that a person obligated under the workmen's compensation law who "contends that a person or persons other than the employer is liable to pay damages, on account of such injury or death" upon proper notice given of such contention "shall be subrogated, to the extent" of the rights which the injured employee or persons "entitled to recover on account of his death shall have against such notified persons, and shall have a lien therefor against the net recovery."</div><div class="casepar">Is the insurer under a policy of insurance providing uninsured motorist coverage such a "person or persons . . . liable to pay damages" within the meaning of this statute giving subrogation rights to one obligated to pay workmen's compensation benefits? We think the answer is yes.</div><div class="casepar">This being a case of first impression in Georgia we have viewed decisions from other jurisdictions involving this question but find that most of these cases turn on language not included in our subrogation and uninsured motorist statutes. We find most persuasive the reasoning in two Arkansas cases, Jones v. Morrison, 284 FSupp. 1016, and Boehler v. Insurance Company of North America, 290 FSupp. 867, which hold that the workmen's compensation carrier is entitled to subrogation to any proceeds which become available to the claimant by reason of uninsured motorist coverage.</div><div class="casepar">The Supreme Court, in commenting on the purpose of the subrogation statute stated that (1) it is a means of recouping the employer's loss, (2) it prevents double recovery by the employee, and (3) it accomplishes substantial justice. Southern R. Co. v. Overnite Transportation Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../152/23/index.html">223 Ga. 825</a></span>, 830 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../152/23/index.html">158 SE2d 387</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">In view of our workmen's compensation statute dealing with subrogation and the provisions of the uninsured motorist statute, we conclude that the employer and workmen's compensation carrier is entitled to subrogation to proceeds which become available to a claimant by reason of uninsured motorist coverage.</div><div class="casepar">2. Having reached this conclusion, we consider the issue of whether, in view of the law governing intervention, the trial court erred in refusing to allow the Board of Regents to intervene in this proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">Section 24 of the Civil Practice Act (Ga. L. 1966, pp. 609, 633; 1967, pp. 226, 232; 1968, pp. 1104, 1108; Code Ann.  81A-124) purports to confer an absolute right to intervene ((a) (1)) if a statute so provides, or ((a) (2)) if the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction involved and disposition of the action as a practical matter may impair or impede the ability to protect the interest. The statute also confers a permissive right to intervene ((b) (1)) if a statute confers a conditional right or ((b) (2)) if the claim and the main action involve a question of law or fact in common, in which event the court, in exercising a discretion, shall consider whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</div><div class="casepar">It is clear from the record before this court that the purported claim is adverse to that of the parties to the original action, and that the court, in refusing to allow intervention, determined that as a matter of law no claim existed and exercised no discretion. We are of the opinion that a claim does exist, but find no statute conferring an absolute right of intervention. If, however, the plaintiff is successful in establishing her claim against the defendant, it is also clear from the allegations that she will refuse or fail to reimburse the Board of Regents for workmen's compensation payments, and thus, as a practical matter, impede the ability of the Board of Regents to protect its interest. The defendant's claim is, of course, adverse to both the plaintiff and the intervenor.</div><div class="casepar">Before the effective date of the Civil Practice Act the law appears to have been settled that in an action by a workmen's compensation claimant against a tortfeasor the courts generally would not allow the employer or insurer to intervene. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Bumstead, <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 692 (1) (186 SE 742)</span>; Travelers Ins. Co. v. Bagwell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../640/90/index.html">116 Ga. App. 675 (158 SE2d 267)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In the Bagwell case, however, the Court of Appeals, while adhering to this general rule, noted the absence of any showing of special circumstances, i.e., "that the intervenor's lien needs protection or that there is any likelihood that a recovery will be dissipated without payment to the intervenor" or "that the employee is insolvent or . . . may fail or refuse to pay the intervenor" or "that any fraud or collusion is being practiced" and stated that to allow intervention in the case then under consideration would "give the right of intervention in a common lawsuit when the intervenor would have no right to intervene in, or be entitled to relief in, a court of equity under the allegations made." Travelers Ins. Co. v. Bagwell, supra, p. 676.</div><div class="casepar">Considering the present intervention statute ( 24, CPA, supra) as well as the right of subrogation (Code Ann.  114-403, supra) in the light of the foregoing decisions relating to the underlying principles affecting intervention and subrogation we think the motion and proposed complaint of the Board of Regents are sufficient not only to state a claim based on subrogation, but a right to intervene, not by reason of any unconditional right, but because the alleged facts disclose that a disposition of the matter without intervention may impair or impede the ability of the Board of Regents to protect its interest, which, because of the adverse claims of the original parties, is not adequately represented.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly the trial court erred in refusing to allow the intervention as a matter of right ( 24 (a) (2), CPA, supra) and we do not reach any issue involving his failure to exercise a discretion with respect to permissive intervention.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Erwin, Epting, Gibson &amp; Chilivis, Larry V.
