Before Judge Stephens.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On January 15, 1999, J. Kenneth Shealy and Shealy Family Partnership (collectively "plaintiffs") sued the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County ("Athens-Clarke County") in superior court, alleging that toxic and/or hazardous substances had escaped from a landfill operated by Athens-Clarke County and contaminated certain property owned by the plaintiffs. The complaint sought damages for nuisance, trespass, and inverse condemnation arising out of such contamination. In addition, the complaint sought injunctive relief to prevent Athens-Clarke County from instituting condemnation proceedings with respect to the property. The trial court subsequently held that the plaintiffs' claims became moot when the property was later condemned. On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in holding that their claims for damages were rendered moot by the condemnation. For reasons discussed below, we reverse.</div><div class="casepar">At the time the plaintiffs filed their complaint, Athens-Clarke County had already initiated two separate condemnation proceedings in superior court, although the plaintiffs had not yet been served and were apparently unaware of such actions. Athens-Clarke County sought to condemn the property and acquire fee simple ownership in order to facilitate environmental remediation efforts. A hearing in these two condemnation cases was held before a special master on February 8, 1999, and the special master entered awards in the two cases on February 10, 1999. The plaintiffs filed nonvalue exceptions to these awards, asserting that the condemnation was improper, and the cases were transferred to the superior court to consider these exceptions.</div><div class="casepar">On February 19, 1999, Athens-Clarke County filed an answer to the plaintiffs' complaint in this case, asserting, among other things, that their claim for injunctive relief was moot because condemnation proceedings had already been instituted and the special master had entered awards in such proceedings. On April 2, 1999, the superior court held a hearing to consider the plaintiffs' exceptions to the condemnation awards, as well as their claim for injunctive relief and Athens-Clarke County's motion to dismiss that claim. With respect to the condemnation proceedings, the plaintiffs asserted that the proposed condemnation was not reasonably necessary for any valid public purpose, that it resulted in the taking of more land than was reasonably necessary, and that it resulted in the taking of a greater interest in the land than was reasonably necessary. With respect to their request for an injunction, the plaintiffs' attorney conceded that the court obviously could not enjoin the special master hearing that had already occurred. On June 4, 1999, the superior court entered a written order approving the condemnation of the subject property. Without further comment, the court also stated that "[t]he claims asserted by Plaintiffs in Civil Action No. SU-99-0086-S are hereby rendered MOOT by this Court's decision."</div><div class="casepar">Although Athens-Clarke County's motion to dismiss addressed only the plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief, the language of the court's order appears to address all claims asserted by the plaintiffs. As the Supreme Court has noted, "if the thing sought to be enjoined in fact takes place, the grant or denial of the injunction becomes moot." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Thus, the plaintiffs do not contest the trial court's holding that their claim for injunctive relief was rendered moot by the condemnation proceedings. However, neither the trial court nor Athens-Clarke County cites any authority for the proposition that a trial court may dismiss a claim for damages on the grounds of"mootness," nor do they state what it means to say that such a claim is "moot." Although the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel may preclude relitigation of matters already litigated, those are affirmative defenses that must be pleaded and proved. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Because Athens-Clarke County did not raise such defenses, and the trial court did not purport to rely on them, we do not construe the Court's order as being based on either of these defenses. Rather, it appears that the trial court simply concluded that the issues presented in the plaintiffs' complaint must necessarily have been the same as those presented in the condemnation actions and that the resolution of the condemnation proceedings must therefore have left nothing to decide in the plaintiffs' lawsuit.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs argue that their claims for nuisance, trespass, and inverse condemnation were not in fact rendered moot by the condemnation awards because the types of damages sought were not recoverable in the condemnation proceedings. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> We agree.</div><div class="casepar">In a condemnation proceeding, the condemnee is entitled to recover two types of damages: (1) the market value of the property actually taken, and (2) any consequential damage to the remainder of the owner's property caused by the taking. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> The value of the property is to be determined as of the date of taking. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> In a formal condemnation case, where the condemnor files condemnation proceedings prior to the taking, the "date of taking" has been held to be the date on which compensation is tendered or paid to the landowner. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> A jury cannot consider the value of the property at a time prior to the actual time of taking. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> In determining the market value of the property as of the date of taking, the "general environmental condition of the condemned property," including the need for remediation, is a relevant factor. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Losses occurring prior to the date of taking are not compensable in a condemnation proceeding. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> In particular, losses resulting from a previous taking, even by the same condemnor, are not recoverable in a condemnation proceeding, since "[s]uch damages are not a consequence of the instant taking." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Such damages must be recovered in "an independent suit for damages, and may not be raised in the current condemnation proceedings." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In the two condemnation cases filed by Athens-Clarke County, the "taking" at issue was the taking of fee simple title to the property. It does not appear that compensation was tendered before the special master hearing. Thus, the "date of taking" could not have been before that time, and "the only question for decision [was] the value of property . . . at the time of taking." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> If the value of the property had already been reduced by the contamination from the landfill, then the value of the property for condemnation purposes would have been the reduced market value, not the market value before the contamination occurred. Any diminution in value would represent a loss occurring as a result of a previous taking, which is not compensable in the condemnation proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs' claim for inverse condemnation is separate from Athens-Clarke County's action to condemn fee simple title. An inverse condemnation claim arises when the governmental entity "creates a condition on private property, such as a nuisance, that amounts to . . . a taking without compensation." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> The measure of damages in an inverse condemnation action is "[t]he actual depreciation in market value of the premises resulting from the taking and the effect upon the property." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> Such damages are intended to be "a substitute for the damages recoverable in a condemnation proceeding." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> In essence, therefore, an inverse condemnation proceeding is an action by the landowner to recover compensation for an injury to the property that has already occurred.</div><div class="casepar">In their inverse condemnation claim, the plaintiffs alleged that their property had been damaged by the contamination from Athens-Clarke County's landfill and that such damage amounted to a taking of their property for public purposes without just and adequate compensation. Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, any such damage would have occurred before the date of the taking in the two condemnation actions filed by Athens-Clarke County. Thus, the measure of damages recoverable in the inverse condemnation proceeding would be the reduction in market value of the property caused by the contamination. As discussed above, such damages would not be recoverable in the formal condemnation proceedings initiated by Athens-Clarke County.</div><div class="casepar">The fact that title to the property passed to Athens-Clarke County upon the condemnation does not deprive the plaintiffs of the ability to proceed with their inverse condemnation claim. The general rule, as stated in CJS, is that</div><div class="casepar">[d]amages for the taking of land or for the injury to land not taken belong to the one who owns the land at the time of the taking or injury, and they do not pass to a subsequent grantee of the land, except by a provision to that effect in the deed or by separate assignment. . . . <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span></div><div class="casepar">"[W]here property is taken or injured under the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the owner thereof at the time of the taking or injury is the proper person to initiate proceedings or sue therefor." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> CJS cites a Georgia case, Green v. South Bound R. Co., <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span> for the proposition that "the right of action is in the grantor alone, notwithstanding the entry was without his consent and without condemnation." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source19" href="#note19">19</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The general rule is also stated by another authority as follows:</div><div class="casepar">If a parcel of land is sold after a portion of it has been taken (or after it has been injuriously affected by the construction of some authorized public work), the right to compensation, constitutional or statutory, does not run with the land but remains a personal claim in the hands of the vendor, unless it has been assigned by special assignment or by a provision in the deed. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span></div><div class="casepar">In Brooks Investment Co. v. City of Bloomington, the Minnesota Supreme Court discussed the "simple and logical" rationale behind the rule:</div><div class="casepar">When the government interferes with a person's right to possession and enjoyment of his property to such an extent so as to create a "taking" in the constitutional sense, a right to compensation vests in the person owning the property at the time of such interference. This right has the status of property, is personal to the owner, and does not run with the land if he should subsequently transfer it without an assignment of such right. The theory is that where the government interferes with a person's property to such a substantial extent, the owner has lost a part of his interest in the real property. Substituted for the property loss is the right to compensation. When the original owner conveys what remains of the realty, he does not transfer the right to compensation for the portion he has lost without a separate assignment of such right. If the rule were otherwise, the original owner of damaged property would suffer a loss and the purchaser of that property would receive a windfall. Presumably, the purchaser will pay the seller only for the real property interest that the seller possesses at the time of the sale and can transfer. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The same analysis should apply whether the subsequent transfer of property is achieved through a voluntary sale or through a formal condemnation instituted after the property has been damaged. The compensation available in such condemnation proceeding is the market value of the property as of the date of the taking, not the market value before the previous taking. As we have previously noted,</div><div class="casepar">[t]hough the law generally favors the prevention of a multiplicity of actions, it appears that condemnation law in Georgia rather strictly limits the relevant evidence in condemnation cases and therefore separate suits for different kinds of damages are not uncommon. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source22" href="#note22">22</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Because the damages recoverable in the two actions were different, the trial court erred in concluding that the inverse condemnation claim was rendered "moot" by the subsequent condemnation of the fee simple title.</div><div class="casepar">Although the plaintiffs also asserted claims for nuisance and trespass, these are in effect duplicative of the inverse condemnation claim. All three claims are based on the exact occurrence -- i.e., "[t]he escape of toxic and/or hazardous substances from the site of the Landfill and the consequent contamination of Plaintiffs' water and soil." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/1/4/index.html">36-1-4</a></span> states that "[a] county is not liable to suit for any cause of action unless made so by statute." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source23" href="#note23">23</a></span> The Supreme Court has held, however, that "the constitutional prohibition against the taking of property without just compensation falls within this exception." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source24" href="#note24">24</a></span> Thus, "[a] county may be liable for damages . . . if it creates a condition on private property, such as a nuisance, that amounts to inverse condemnation or a taking without compensation." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span> The damages available are limited to those recoverable in a condemnation proceeding. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source26" href="#note26">26</a></span> Regardless of how the various claims are denominated, therefore, the plaintiffs may recover if and only if the contamination amounted to the taking of property without just compensation, and the measure of damages is the same as for the inverse condemnation claim. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source27" href="#note27">27</a></span> Accordingly, although the claims may be duplicative, none of them is subject to dismissal on the grounds of mootness.</div><div class="casepar">Ellen W.
