No issue having been raised by either the pleadings or the evidence as to whether the debt sued on was a partnership liability, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict upon proof that he contracted with and worked for the defendant, one of the alleged partners, in his individual capacity.</div><div class="casepar">2. Where, as here, the verdict as directed and entered is demanded by the evidence, it is not error for the trial court to direct the jury to return it.</div><div class="casepar">On April 29, 1951, W. G. Akins filed suit against Edd Davis in the Superior Court of Jackson County, seeking to enforce a laborer's lien on certain described property. The petition alleged that, on or about July 1, 1950, the defendant obligated himself to pay the plaintiff $50 per week for certain services of the plaintiff in managing and working on the land described; that the plaintiff performed his contract and there is a balance due him on said contract of $1491.50; that, within three months from the completion of the contract, he recorded his claim of lien on the property in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Jackson County, a copy of the lien being attached as an exhibit and its verification dated April 29, 1951; and that he prays for a general judgment against the defendant for $1491.50 and for a judgment with a special lien on the land. The defendant filed an answer denying all the allegations of the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Upon the trial of the case, the plaintiff, the sole witness, testified that, about July 1, 1950, the defendant hired him to do general work on the land described in the petition, including working the farm, building fences, tending cattle, overhauling the houses, and anything else which needed doing, at a salary of $50 per week; that the plaintiff worked at the defendant's direction and was paid by him; that he worked for a period of thirty-three weeks; that at the defendant's direction he employed a third person to do certain work with a bulldozer and paid him $30 per week, or $360, out of money paid over to him by the defendant and at the latter's direction; that, after he had worked a few weeks the defendant told him that he could not pay him $50 at the end of each week, but would pay the balance of wages due him shortly when he received some expected funds; that in all the defendant gave the plaintiff $518.50, $360 of which was paid to the laborer, and still owes him $1491.50.</div><div class="casepar">The court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the sum sued upon. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for a new trial, which was later amended by the addition of one special ground, and the overruling of this motion is assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. The special assignment of error complains that the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Since a consideration of this ground requires a study of all the evidence in the case, it will be considered with the general grounds. "Where there is no conflict in the evidence, and that introduced, with all reasonable deductions or inferences therefrom, shall demand a particular verdict, the court may direct the jury to find for the party entitled thereto." Code,  110-104. It is contended, however, that the plaintiff's evidence shows the debt in question to be a partnership liability. The plaintiff testified that, at the time he entered into the contract with the defendant, the latter advised him that he and one Taft Moody were partners in the operation, and that both farms were operated by the partnership composed of him and Mr. Moody. However, the evidence clearly shows that his contract was with the defendant; that the defendant individually obligated himself to pay the plaintiff, and that he did make all the payments that were made. In Wood v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">115 Ga. 147</span> (41 S. E. 490), it is held that, where one borrows money on his own credit only, it does not become a partnership debt merely because the money may have been borrowed and used by such individual for partnership purposes. In Champion v. Wilson &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. 184</span>, it is held that, although where one is sued individually there can be no legal recovery against him as a partner, nevertheless the plaintiff must sue the defendant in the capacity in which he contracted with him. The plaintiff here contracted with the defendant in his individual capacity. In Bray v. Peace, <span class="casemissing">131 Ga. 637 (2)</span> (62 S. E. 1025), it is held: "If it appears on the face of the petition that the suit is brought against an individual for the debt of a partnership of which he is a member, objection may be raised by demurrer. If it does not so appear, but the defendant claims that the suit against him as an individual is based upon a partnership liability, and that the other partner is a necessary party, the point should be raised by a plea in abatement." No such contention was presented by the defendant, either by special plea or by evidence. Whether or not there was a partnership, there is no evidence that the debt sued upon was a partnership liability. This contention is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is contended that it was error to direct the verdict in favor of the plaintiff because the lien did not materialize under the provisions of Code  67-2002 and 67-2301, there being no evidence that it was recorded within three months from the completion of the work. The verdict directed by the court and entered of record was only a money verdict for the sum alleged to be due. Such a verdict was authorized by the pleadings, requested by the prayer, and demanded by the evidence. The validity of this verdict did not depend upon proof that the claim of lien had been recorded within three months from the completion of, the work. Since the verdict was demanded by the evidence, it was not error to direct the jury to return it.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in overruling the motion for a new trial as amended.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
