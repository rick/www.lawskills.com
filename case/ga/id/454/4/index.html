Houston Superior Court. Before Judge Lawson from Oconee Circuit.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. In May of 1973, Carl Isaacs escaped from a Maryland penal institution and, accompanied by his younger brother Billy Isaacs, his half-brother Wayne Coleman and a friend, George Dungee, drove to Florida. On the afternoon of May 14, 1973, they were in Seminole County, Georgia, and their car was almost out of gas. They thought they saw a gas pump behind the rural mobile home belonging to Jerry Alday and Mary Alday and stopped to investigate it. They discovered there was no pump; however, the trailer was empty, and they decided to burglarize it. Dungee remained in the car while the defendant and Wayne Coleman entered the trailer. While they were inside, Billy Isaacs warned them two men were approaching in a jeep.</div><div class="casepar">Jerry Alday and his father Ned Alday pulled in behind the trailer, unaware that it was being burglarized. Carl Isaacs met them and ordered them inside at gunpoint. After their pockets were emptied, Jerry Alday was taken into the south bedroom of the trailer while Ned was taken to the north bedroom. Carl Isaacs shot and killed Jerry Alday, and then both he and Coleman shot and killed Ned Alday.</div><div class="casepar">Soon afterward, Jimmy Alday (Jerry Alday's brother) drove up on a tractor, walked to the back door, and knocked on the door. Coleman answered the door, "stuck a pistol up in the guy's face," and ordered him inside. He was taken into the living room and forced to lie on the sofa. Carl Isaacs shot and killed him.</div><div class="casepar">After Carl Isaacs went outside to move the tractor, which was parked in front of their car, Mary Alday (Jerry Alday's wife) drove up. Carl Isaacs entered the trailer behind her and accosted her. Meanwhile, Chester Alday (Jerry Alday's brother) and Aubrey Alday (Jerry Alday's uncle) drove up in a pickup truck. Leaving Coleman and Dungee to watch Mary Alday, Carl and Billy Isaacs went outside to confront the two men, and forced them at gunpoint into the trailer. Once inside, Aubrey was taken to the south bedroom where Carl Isaacs shot and killed him, while Chester Alday was taken to the north bedroom and killed by Coleman.</div><div class="casepar">Coleman and Carl Isaacs raped Mary Alday on her kitchen table. Afterward, they drove to a heavily wooded area several miles away where Mary Alday was raped again. Dungee killed her. They aban-</div><div class="casepar">doned their car in the woods and took Mary Alday's car, which they later abandoned in Alabama. They stole another car there, and were arrested a few days later in West Virginia, in possession of guns later identified as the murder weapons, and property belonging to the victims.</div><div class="casepar">After his original trial, Carl Isaacs was interviewed by a film maker who was producing a documentary about the case. The defendant admitted shooting Jerry, Ned, Aubrey and Jimmy Alday, raping Mary Alday, and burglarizing the trailer. These admissions were introduced in evidence at the retrial.</div><div class="casepar">Carl Isaacs was convicted of six counts of murder. The evidence supports the verdict. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">2. In his first six enumerations of error, Isaacs complains of the grand jury deliberations. Specifically, he contends that he was entitled to a grand jury free from exposure to pre-trial publicity and that the trial court erred in refusing to voir dire the grand jurors extensively or to give them special instructions about their deliberations. He contends, in addition, that he should have been provided a transcript of the grand jury proceedings, that the indictment may have been based upon hearsay testimony and that the evidence was insufficient to support a true bill.</div><div class="casepar">(a) We note:</div><div class="casepar">Generally, in the absence of a controlling statutory provision, a person is not disqualified or incompetent to serve as a grand juror by reason of bias or prejudice on his part, by the fact that he has heard or read about the case under investigation or has even formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt of the accused, or by his interest in a prosecution other than a direct pecuniary interest. [Footnotes omitted.] [38 AmJur2d 951, Grand Jury,  7.]</div><div class="casepar">Our Code provides for a change of venue in a grand jury criminal investigation "when it appears that a qualified grand jury cannot be had. . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/82/index.html">15-12-82</a></span> (a). However, bias, prejudice, and exposure to pre-trial publicity are not mentioned in the Code as possible grounds for disqualification of grand jurors. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Moreover, the grand jury generally is entitled to act upon its own information, however acquired. See Groves v. State, <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. 205 (1884)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">But assuming, without deciding, that remedial action may be necessary in some cases of alleged grand jury bias, we hold that the trial court's response in this case was sufficient. First, the court quashed the Seminole County indictment after granting a change of venue, and Isaacs was indicted in Houston County. Second, before any evidence was presented to the Houston County grand jury, the court conducted a limited voir dire of the grand jury concerning possible bias and excused one grand juror who had signed a petition in connection with the case. There was no error.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Relying upon United States v. Estepa, 471 F2d 1132 (2nd Cir. 1972), Isaacs contends it is improper to base an indictment on hearsay evidence. In Estepa, the defendant's conviction was reversed and the indictment dismissed where the government introduced hearsay evidence in a manner that misled the grand jury into believing that it was first-hand evidence instead of hearsay. The reversal was not a consequence of the mere use of hearsay, but the misleading use of hearsay. Estepa, of course, is not binding authority in this state. See Conner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/4/index.html">251 Ga. 113 (5) (303 SE2d 266) (1983)</a></span>. Moreover, "Estepa has not been met with great enthusiasm by the other courts of appeal." Moore's Federal Practice (2nd ed.), Vol 8 at 6-104. The rule in this state is:</div><div class="casepar">[W]here . . . it appears that a competent witness or witnesses were sworn and examined before the grand jury by whom the indictment was preferred, a plea in abatement on the ground that it was found on insufficient evidence, or illegal evidence, or no evidence, will not be sustained, because it comes under the rule that no inquiry into the sufficiency or legality of the evidence is indulged. [ Felker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">252 Ga. 351</a></span>, 366 (2 a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">314 SE2d 621</a></span>) (1984) (quoting Summers v. State, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 445 (3) (11 SE2d 409) (1940)</span>).]</div><div class="casepar">Accord Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359 (76 SC 406, 100 LE 397) (1956) (holding that a contrary rule "would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by the technical rules." Id. 350 U. S. at 364).</div><div class="casepar">(c) A defendant is not entitled to a transcript of the grand jury proceedings. Frazier v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../524/1/index.html">257 Ga. 690 (6) (362 SE2d 351) (1987)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. In enumerations of error 7 through 13, Isaacs raises issues concerning the grand and traverse jury arrays.</div><div class="casepar">On November 2, 1987, the trial court heard evidence on the defendant's challenges to the jury arrays. The defendant contended, inter alia, that active-duty military personnel and their dependents are underrepresented on the grand and traverse jury lists in Houston County. At the conclusion of the hearing, the defendant asked that the evidence be held open so he could supplement his presentation. The court agreed to do so, ultimately setting December 28, 1987, as the deadline for supplementing the evidence on this issue.</div><div class="casepar">At the December 28 hearing, the defendant asked for more time to "take the rough figures that we have been able to gather [as to the underrepresentation of military personnel] to get a qualified expert to put them in a statistical form that would be acceptable to the court and subject to cross-examination." The defendant conceded that he planned to present no evidence that military personnel are a cognizable group, and the court refused to grant a further continuance on this issue.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Citing Guest v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../392/89/index.html">186 Ga. App. 318 (1) (367 SE2d 105) (1988)</a></span>, Isaacs contends the court erred by setting a deadline for disposing of his jury challenges because (he says) a jury challenge is timely filed any time prior to voir dire.</div><div class="casepar">We agree that in the absence of a timely trial court directive to the contrary, a challenge to the traverse jury array is timely filed any time before the voir dire begins. Guest v. State, supra. However, trial courts retain the discretion--and commonly exercise it--to set a time certain by which pre-trial motions must be filed and heard. See, e.g., Rule 7.3 of the Superior Court Rules, Ga. Ct. &amp; Bar Rules, p. 3-17. We do not find an abuse of discretion in this case. The issue was heard on November 2. The defendant had almost two additional months to supplement the record. We agree with the trial court "that the defense . . . had an adequate opportunity to support the motion."</div><div class="casepar">Even if the record had been held open, the defendant could not have prevailed absent proof, which he concededly did not plan to offer, that active-duty military personnel are a cognizable group. See, e.g., Willis v. Kemp, 838 F2d 1510 (I) (11th Cir. 1988). Moreover, although it may not be determinative of the cognizability issue, it is persuasive that active-duty military personnel are barred from federal jury service by 28 USC  1863 (b) (6), and, to our knowledge, no court has ever found a violation of the fair cross-section requirement based</div><div class="casepar">upon this exclusion.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err by denying Isaac's motion for continuance and by denying his challenges to the grand and traverse jury arrays. Frazier v. State, 257 Ga., supra at (2).</div><div class="casepar">(b) The manner in which grand jury forepersons are selected in Houston County provides no basis upon which to reverse the defendant's conviction or dismiss his indictment. Ingram v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../625/0/index.html">253 Ga. 622</a></span> (1 c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../625/0/index.html">323 SE2d 801</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">4. We decline to reconsider our holding in Isaacs v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../527/8/index.html">257 Ga. 798 (364 SE2d 567) (1988)</a></span>, concerning the effect of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/53.1/index.html">17-7-53.1</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">5. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/164/index.html">15-12-164</a></span> is not unconstitutional for any reason asserted. See Skipper v.

State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../558/7/index.html">256 Ga. 821 (4) (353 SE2d 468) (1987)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">6. The appointment of assistant attorney general William Hill as a special assistant district attorney in this case was authorized under Rule 42.1 of the Uniform Superior Court Rules. Ga. Ct. and Bar Rules, p. 3-59. We perceive no conflict between Rule 42.1 and Article V, Sec. III, Par. IV of the Georgia Constitution. Cf. State v. Cook, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../442/25/index.html">172 Ga. App. 433 (3) (323 SE2d 634) (1984)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. Our death penalty laws are not unconstitutional for any reason alleged. The trial court did not err by refusing to appoint an additional attorney to assist the defendant in answering questions pursuant to the Unified Appeal Procedure. Blankenship v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../462/5/index.html">258 Ga. 43 (1) (365 SE2d 265) (1988)</a></span>. We do not agree with the defendant's contention that giving him the opportunity "to raise questions or objections concerning his counsel's assistance Sliger v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../732/2/index.html">248 Ga. 316</a></span>, 319 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../732/2/index.html">282 SE2d 291</a></span>) (1981), requires him "to make legal de-terminations that only a trained and experienced lawyer can do [sic]. . . ." Appellant's brief at p. 158.</div><div class="casepar">8. Isaacs filed a pre-trial motion for bail, relying upon OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/50/index.html">17-7-50</a></span>, which provides that a defendant is entitled to bail as of right if he is not indicted within 90 days of confinement. Because Isaacs was indicted within 90 days of his original arrest, and because less than 90 days elapsed between the time the Seminole County indictments were quashed and Isaacs was reindicted in Houston County, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/50/index.html">17-7-50</a></span> plainly did not entitle Isaacs to bail as a matter of right. The trial court properly denied the defendant's  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/50/index.html">17-7-50</a></span> motion for bail.</div><div class="casepar">Isaacs now argues that the trial court erred by "summarily" denying bail, pointing out that even if he was not entitled to bail as of right, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/50/index.html">17-7-50</a></span>, the superior court may grant bail in a capital murder case pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/6/1/index.html">17-6-1</a></span> (e), provided the court can make certain findings relative to the risk of allowing the defendant's release on bail.</div><div class="casepar">It is settled that "[a] court may . . . refuse bail in capital cases." United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (107 SC 2095, 2104, 95 LE2d 697) (1987). Given Isaac's history of escapes and attempted escapes, his pre-trial statement that he would continue trying to escape, and the "considered presumption of generations of judges that a defendant in danger of execution has an extremely strong incentive to flee," United States v. Salerno, supra at 2110 (fn. 6) (Marshall, J., dissenting), the trial court would plainly have been entitled under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/6/1/index.html">17-6-1</a></span> (e) to deny bail on the record before it absent any compelling evidence to the contrary, which the defendant did not even try to present, since he did not invoke the provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/6/1/index.html">17-6-1</a></span> at trial.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court's denial of bail was not error.</div><div class="casepar">9. Isaacs was interviewed about this crime by television reporter Mark Piccard after the original trial but before the retrial. Isaacs stated that if he had it to do over, he would commit the crime again. The state offered this evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial to show the defendant's lack of remorse.</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to the defendant's contention, the defendant's remorse or lack thereof is a permissible area of inquiry during sentencing. Fair v. State, <span class="casemissing">245 Ga. 868 (4) (268 SE2d 316) (1980)</span>. Compare, cf., United States v. Reed, 882 F2d 147, 150-51 (5th Cir. 1989) (approving federal sentencing guidelines provision for reduction of sentence when defendant demonstrates "affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility" manifested by "sincere contrition" (emphasis supplied)).</div><div class="casepar">Piccard's testimony was not otherwise inadmissible. See Division 30, post.</div><div class="casepar">10. Consistent with the requirements of the Unified Appeal Procedure, the district attorney stated before the defendant was arraigned that he intended to seek the death penalty. There is no requirement that this announcement be furnished in writing to the defendant. See Rule II (A) (1) of the Unified Appeal Procedure, Ga.

The trial court granted funds for an independent psychiatric evaluation, and there is no issue about this request for funds. The court did not specifically award funds on any of the other requests, but did authorize the payment of $4000 to the defense, to use as it saw fit in the preparation and investigation of the case.</div><div class="casepar">With these funds, Isaacs retained the services of Hans Selvog, the director of the Southeastern Regional Office for the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives. Selvog conducted a comprehensive background investigation of the defendant and testified on the defendant's behalf at the sentencing phase of the trial. Isaacs also obtained the services of the Center for Rehabilitation and Therapy, Inc., to assist him with his challenges to the jury arrays and with the selection of the trial jury.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Equal protection doctrine does not require that an indigent defendant be provided funds for expert assistance simply because the state is assisted by experts.

Such necessity is not shown merely by noting that the defendant's attorney is not himself an expert and suggesting in general terms that a defense expert could help the defendant cross-examine the state's expert. Cf. Moore v. Kemp, 809 F2d 702, 712 (11th Cir. 1987).</div><div class="casepar">Isaacs has not shown a reasonable probability that the assistance of a pathologist, ballistics expert, fingerprint expert, or an investigator (in addition to the investigative assistance provided by the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives) was necessary to his defense or that without such assistance his trial was rendered unfair.

As noted previously, in Div. (2 a), ante, a change of venue was granted and the case was moved from Seminole County to Houston County for trial. After the move, Isaacs again sought a change of venue, claiming that because of pretrial publicity, he could not get a fair trial in Houston County.</div><div class="casepar">Isaacs contends the "presumed prejudice" standard should apply here as it did to the original Seminole County trial. See Isaacs v. Kemp, 778 F2d, supra; Coleman v. Kemp, 778 F2d 1487 (11th Cir. 1985). We disagree. As is noted in Coleman, the "presumed prejudice standard is 'rarely' applicable. . . ." Coleman v. Kemp, supra at 1490. Houston County was not subjected to an inundation of inflammatory pretrial publicity comparable to that which pervaded Seminole County before the original trial in this case. Moreover, the crime was not committed in Houston County, and was 15 years old when the case was tried the second time. Compare Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (104 SC 2885, 81 LE2d 847) (1984). The defendant comes close to contending his case is so notorious it can never be tried anywhere in this state. We do not agree, and find the presumed prejudice standard inapplicable.</div><div class="casepar">Where the presumed prejudice standard does not apply, the defendant can prevail on a motion for change of venue based on excessive pretrial publicity only if he can show actual prejudice "from the jury selection process itself--the voir dire examination and qualification of prospective jurors." Lee v.

This finding is entitled to great deference, and we do not find it to be erroneous. Compare Devier v.

On July 28, 1980, four death-row inmates escaped from custody. Carl Isaacs masterminded the escape but did not join the escapees because he was transferred to another prison less than two hours before the inmates had planned to leave. Isaacs was interviewed several times about his part in the escape attempt, and wrote a 46-page statement outlining his participation. In the introductory paragraphs, Isaacs stated:</div><div class="casepar">Herein lies the truthful story of one of the greatest escapes that has ever been recorded in the annuls [sic] of history, perhaps it could even be the greatest.</div><div class="casepar">Isaacs went on to describe how he had befriended persons on the outside, including a woman who had seen his picture in the paper and had "fallen in love" with him. He enlisted the aid of other inmates, some of whom he managed to have moved into his cellblock. Relying upon his outside acquaintances and theirs, they successfully smuggled into prison hacksaw blades, pajamas, shoes, belts and other items. The plan was to cut enough bars that all the prisoners involved could get out of their cells, through a fire escape door onto a catwalk, and then through another window which led to a roof. They concealed the cuts in the bars with bubble gum, cardboard and paint until they were ready to go. In the meantime they made guard uniforms to wear during the escape, dyeing shoes, belts, and pajamas, making imitation badges and nightstick holders, and obtaining real flag patches from sources inside the prison.</div><div class="casepar">On the morning of the escape, each man involved was to proceed to the catwalk, where he would be issued his "uniform." After donning their uniforms, the escapees were to proceed to the roof, where they would wait until 4:45 a.m., when a car would drive by to create a "diversion." They would climb or jump down to the first floor roof and wait until 4:50, when the car would drive by again, and they would jump to the ground. There was a shift change about this time, and they would simply walk in their guard uniforms to a car that was to be left for them in the parking lot and drive away.</div><div class="casepar">At 3:30 a.m. on the day of the escape, a guard came to Isaacs' cell and told him to pack; he was going to be transferred. Rather than jeopardize the others' chance to escape, Isaacs decided to let himself be transferred.</div><div class="casepar">In 1985, Isaacs was caught in another escape attempt. This attempt was similarly intricate, and involved smuggling hacksaw blades, paint, glue and other material into prison. He cut into a ventilation duct and planned to get from there outside the prison building. After cutting through the fence, he planned to proceed to an area a mile or so away where a friend had left him a "stash." He was caught when a guard noticed the vent in his cell was not quite the same color as the rest of the cell.</div><div class="casepar">Isaacs was interviewed about this escape attempt by the GBI.</div><div class="casepar">The statements given by Isaacs about his two escape attempts were introduced in evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Isaacs contends the statements were not voluntary, and were given because he was afraid for his life. As the state points out, the statements themselves are compelling evidence that they were voluntarily given by one who was proud of his accomplishments. Moreover, one of his own witnesses at the Jackson-Denno hearing testified:</div><div class="casepar">Your client [Isaacs] is lying to you and lying to this court. Man, there ain't nobody ever threatened that man. As a matter of fact, he's one of the best assets anybody has got on death row. They get him in a cell block and they love him because he's an escape risk and everybody thinks he's a genius. . . .</div><div class="casepar">He ain't never been forced to give a statement. He ain't never been forced to do nothing. He had so many guards on death row that loved him. . . .</div><div class="casepar">Before Isaacs was interviewed by the GBI, he was advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (86 SC 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966). The trial court did not err by finding the statements to have been given voluntarily, after a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Isaacs also contends the statements were improperly admitted in aggravation because they were evidence of crimes for which the defendant has not been convicted.</div><div class="casepar">However:</div><div class="casepar">As we held in Devier v.

Austin, 663 F2d 558 (5th Cir., Unit B 1982), the predecessor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held it was improper to excuse a prospective juror on Witherspoon grounds simply because the juror stated she would be unable to write out a verdict of death if selected as foreperson of the jury. The court noted that the juror had shown herself willing to vote for a death sentence, and held that an ability to sign a death sentence as foreperson was immaterial to the Witherspoon inquiry.</div><div class="casepar">Pretermitting the extent to which Alderman v.

It is true that service as foreperson is not "among every juror's duties," Alderman v. Austin, supra at 563, but agreeing to a sentencing verdict is a part of every juror's duty, since a poll of the jury is required at the sentencing phase of a death penalty trial.

The defendant's complaint is that the trial court allowed the state to ask the prospective juror whether it might be "difficult" for the juror to impose a death sentence. We agree with the defendant that an affirmative answer to this question would not be sufficient to disqualify the juror. Alderman v. State, supra, 254 Ga. at 207 (4). However, the juror was not disqualified on this or any other basis, and it was not an abuse of discretion to allow the state merely to ask the question. Curry v. State, supra, 255 Ga. at 218 (2 b).</div><div class="casepar">Nor was there a restriction of the defense voir dire examination of the fourth of these prospective jurors (enumeration 85). The court simply ruled that the defendant himself could not ask a final voir dire question after his attorney had concluded his voir dire examination. This ruling was not error. Although a defendant has a right to represent himself, he does not have the right to act as co-counsel. Hance v. Kemp, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../487/9/index.html">258 Ga. 649 (1) (373 SE2d 184) (1988)</a></span>.

The case on which he relies, King v. Lynaugh, 828 F2d 257 (5th Cir. 1987), was reversed in King v. Lynaugh, 850 F2d 1055 (5th Cir. 1988) (en banc). We find the en banc opinion more persuasive than the vacated panel opinion on which the defendant relies, and find no improper restriction of the voir dire examination, which fills over 2000 pages of transcript, not including the jury questionnaires each prospective juror filled out before entering the courtroom.

Fuller decided to re-interview Isaacs "to compare the stories that Carl and Billy were telling to see how they coincided When he talked to Carl Isaacs again, "he was very open and cooperative, and the stories that he told me did in fact coincide to an extraordinary degree with the story that Billy had told me."

Jernigan, 683 F2d 1332, 1335-36 (fn. 4) (11th Cir. 1982), use of either term is not conclusive of whether the device is permissive or mandatory. An "inference" can be mandatory, and a "presumption" may be permissive. Id.</div><div class="casepar">Whether the device is permissive or mandatory may be determined as follows:</div><div class="casepar">A permissive inference is an evidentiary device that permits, but does not require, the jury to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic fact. By contrast, a mandatory presumption instructs the jury that it must infer the elemental fact once the state has proved the basic fact. The difference between the two may be found in the presence or absence of "language of command" such as 'shall be.' An instruction containing a mandatory presumption commands that the jury reach a particular conclusion, while an instruction couched in terms of an inference merely suggests, but does not command, that the jury do so. Since a permissive inference does not require the jury to reach a certain conclusion, it does not affect the burden of proof, and therefore must meet only the 'rational connection' test. A mandatory presumption, however, eases the prosecution's burden and, therefore, implicates both the 'rational connection' test and the requirement that the prosecution prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

State, supra, because in both cases the court merely substituted "inference" terminology for "presumption" terminology in instructions otherwise invalid under Sandstrom. However, in Powell, the sole change made to language taken from a pre-Sandstrom case was the substitution of the word "infers" for the word "presumes." No other changes were made, and the "language of command" was retained. Such "language of command" is absent from the instructions on criminal intent in this case. Phrases such as "intent may be inferred or "it is reasonable to infer . . .," or "you may draw the inference that . . .," are clearly permissive in nature. There was no violation of Sandstrom.

At 7:10 p.m., a note was delivered to the court that one juror had become ill, and another was upset. The juror who had become ill was taken to the hospital. Ten of the jurors were sent to supper, and the trial judge, accompanied by a court reporter, entered the jury room and talked to the juror who had been reported to be upset. A transcript of this conversation was furnished to both parties the next morning. It is set out, in full, in Appendix A of this opinion. To summarize, however, the juror stated she was upset because she was not sure she was "capable" of voting for a death sentence. The court told her she was entitled to vote her decision whatever it was, and that she had no reason to be ashamed or feel defensive about it. The juror stated she did not know how she wanted to vote, and the court told her she did not have to make her mind up that evening, and that the deliberations would be adjourned until the morning.</div><div class="casepar">The next morning, the court consulted a doctor concerning the juror who had been taken to a hospital.

He testified that he was not as close to the two friends who had died in the automobile accident as he had been to the one who was murdered.</div><div class="casepar">To invalidate the result of a 3-week trial because of a juror's mistaken, though honest, response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give. A trial represents an important investment of private and social resources, and it ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have obtained from a juror on voir dire examination. . . . We hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing in-formation may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror's impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial. [McDonough Power Equipment, Inc., v.

Well, I agreed on some of those counts on the paper. But for some reason, I couldn't vote death. I voted life. And it was one other voted life, too. And to me, I just couldn't make myself do death. But when I was polled, I thought I could; but when it came time to do it, I couldn't make myself do it. And I guess I considered his background and everything, and I just feel like I couldn't do it.</div><div class="casepar">And we talked about it and people told personal things that didn't have anything to do with the case, and then they told about what the alternates felt, that they would vote guilty. And I just started feeling so like I wasn't capable of voting, you know, right. I felt that either I was going to vote because they said all four of the alternates, that they told another juror that they would vote guilty. And that somebody talked about having two sisters killed and the drunk driver got off; then another girl said she was molested. And things like that just ride at me so much that I just don't feel like I'm capable of doing anything no more. I feel like I'm just deadlocked. I don't know how to deal with it no more. And I don't know whether I can live with myself if I voted the death. I think it would hurt me in all ways.

      The crime occurred on May 14, 1973. After the grant of habeas relief by the 11th Circuit, the case was returned to Seminole County. Pretrial proceedings resulted in the recusal of the trial judge assigned to preside over the retrial, see Isaacs v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/3/index.html">257 Ga. 126 (355 SE2d 644) (1987)</a></span>, and Superior Court Judge Hugh Lawson was assigned to the case.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;

      In addition, we note that, especially in light of the defendant's own statements about the crime (see Div. 30, post), we do not agree that Billy's "testimony as to who shot the victims . . . was essential" to establish the defendant's involvement in the crime.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      Seven of these 16 enumerations of error involve prospective jurors dealt with in Div. 20 of this opinion. The defendant contends these seven were both factually biased and impermissibly biased in favor of a death sentence.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
