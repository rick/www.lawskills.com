Before Judge Peeler.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This is a death penalty case. Eddie Lee Ross was convicted in DeKalb County of murder, rape, burglary, forgery in the first degree, and financial transaction card fraud. He was sentenced to death for the murder. The case is here on direct appeal, for review under the Unified Appeal Procedure (252 Ga. A-13 et seq.), and for the sentence review required by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/35/index.html">17-10-35</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Facts</div><div class="casepar">Shortly before 10:00 a.m. on September 2, 1983, Vivian Turner stopped by the home of her 87-year-old mother, Ellen Funderburg. Upon entering the house, she discovered that the house had been ransacked and she found the partially nude body of her mother lying on the bedroom floor. The handle end of a pair of scissors protruded from the victim's chest.</div><div class="casepar">Later that morning, Eddie Lee Ross was arrested at the South DeKalb Mall after he had used the victim's Rich's credit card to purchase a $170 radio. On his person, officers found a check payable to Ross for $80 which bore a signature ostensibly that of Betty Jean Funderburg (one of the victim's daughters who had been deceased for seven years). Subsequently, other personalized checks, some blank and some filled out, belonging either to Ellen or Betty Jean Funderburg, as well as some of their jewelry, were found in the trunk of Ross's automobile.</div><div class="casepar">An autopsy of the victim showed that her skull had been fractured by repeated blows from a blunt object (a broken vase was found near the body), she had been stabbed numerous times (at least once in the heart), and deep in her vagina were small tears consistent with forced penetration by a blunt object such as a male sex organ.</div><div class="casepar">After his arrest, Ross was interrogated, and gave three statements, the last of which was introduced at trial. See Division 3, below. In the last statement, Ross recounted the circumstances of the crime as follows: Sometime after 5:30 a.m., Ross pried open a back window of the Funderburg home with a screwdriver, entered the house, and began searching for money. He entered the bedroom to check on the victim, and for some reason began hitting her with a vase. She woke up and screamed, to which he responded by stabbing her with a pair of scissors. She quit screaming. Then he "started to have sex with her." However, he only "juked about one or two times," and quit, because he "realized that wasn't me, you know." Ross got $11 in cash and some credit cards out of the victim's purse, took a wedding ring off the victim's finger, and took some other jewelry and some checks that he found in the house. He pawned one of the rings for $15 and then filled out one of the checks and tried unsuccessfully to cash it at a bank across the street from South DeKalb Mall. Next, he went to the mall and bought the radio, using the victim's credit card. That purchase, Ross recognized with regret, led to his arrest.</div><div class="casepar">The sufficiency of the evidence is not raised on appeal. However, we have reviewed the evidence pursuant to Rule IV (B) (2) of the Unified Appeal Procedure and find it sufficient to support the convictions. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). Enumerations of Error</div><div class="casepar">1. In his first enumeration of error, Ross contends that two prospective jurors were improperly excused under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (88 SC 1770, 20 LE2d 776) (1968). We do not agree. The voir dire testimony of these two jurors clearly shows that they could not vote for the death penalty no matter what the evidence. Mincey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/7/index.html">251 Ga. 255 (8) (304 SE2d 882) (1983)</a></span>; Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../744/2/index.html">248 Ga. 676 (2) (286 SE2d 3) (1982)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Regarding one of the two jurors, Ross additionally complains that his attempted rehabilitation was prematurely cut off by the court. See Spivey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../611/1/index.html">253 Ga. 187</a></span>, 197 (n. 3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../611/1/index.html">319 SE2d 420</a></span>) (1984). However, we find no reversible error here, inasmuch as the attempt to rehabilitate the prospective juror was limited to whether or not the juror could "consider" the death penalty. "We adhere to our previously stated position that: 'It is not sufficient that the juror be willing to "consider" the death penalty if he or she is committed to automatically vote against the death penalty after having "considered" it.' Cofield v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../757/8/index.html">247 Ga. 98</a></span>, 103 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../757/8/index.html">274 SE2d 530</a></span>) (1981)." Spivey v. State, supra at 193-194.</div><div class="casepar">2. The second enumeration of error, in which Ross complains of the practice of Witherspoon-disqualification of jurors, is without merit. Mincey v. State, supra, (2).</div><div class="casepar">3. Soon after his arrest, on September 2, Ross was brought to the DeKalb Police Department headquarters. Police officer Cunningham gave Ross the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (86 SC 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), and Ross signed a written waiver form reciting that he understood his Miranda rights, waived them, and was willing to make a statement. Officer Cunningham reduced the ensuing statement to writing and the interrogation was temporarily concluded. However, upon talking with his supervisors, Cunningham decided to talk to Ross again in order to obtain from him a more detailed explanation of the events of the crime. Officer Cunningham was joined in this effort by officer Thomas, whom Ross knew from a previous case. The second interrogation followed the first one by approximately 15 minutes and resulted in another statement, again reduced to writing, that was approximately three times as long as the first, and included, at the end, two paragraphs written by Ross himself, in which he swore that the statement was true and stated that he was very sorry and that no one had made him write the note. The interrogation concluded at approximately 5 p.m.</div><div class="casepar">On September 4, Ross was brought before a DeKalb County magistrate for a "first appearance" (see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/4/26/index.html">17-4-26</a></span> and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/4/62/index.html">17-4-62</a></span>), at which a date was set for his committal hearing (see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/23/index.html">17-7-23</a></span> and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/24/index.html">17-7-24</a></span>). Although the usual practice in the DeKalb magistrate court was to hold a committal hearing within seven days of the first appearance, Ross eschewed representation by the public defender and requested additional time so that, with the help of his father, he could retain the services of an attorney of his own choosing. This request was granted, and a committal hearing was set for October 3.</div><div class="casepar">That afternoon, officer Thomas decided that it might be a good idea to talk to Ross one more time and, this time, to tape-record the statement. Ross was willing and, after re-advising Ross of his Miranda rights and eliciting from Ross that he understood those rights, Thomas tape-recorded a third statement.</div><div class="casepar">At trial, the admissibility of the confessions was contested, and the court conducted a Jackson-Denno hearing outside the presence of the jury. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ruled that all three were voluntary, but, presented together, would be unduly cumulative. The court offered the state the choice of presenting to the jury only the first two, or only the third. The state chose the latter alternative, and, thus, the jury heard only the third, tape-recorded confession.</div><div class="casepar">In his third enumeration of error, Ross contends that the third statement was taken in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, and should therefore have been suppressed.</div><div class="casepar">(a) In Miranda v. Arizona, supra, the United States Supreme Court decided that an accused in police custody has a Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself and that to protect this right, any custodial interrogation must be preceded by the now-familiar Miranda warnings, which include a right to counsel during the interrogation. See New York v. Quarles, ---- U. S. ---- (104 SC 2626, 2634-35, 81 LE2d 550) (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This Miranda right to counsel can be waived; however, "a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." Miranda, supra, 384 U. S. at 475.</div><div class="casepar">The determination whether an accused has intentionally relinquished or abandoned a known right or privilege, such as a Miranda right to counsel, is determined by reference to " 'the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.' Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 [58 SC 1019, 82 LE 1461]; [cits]." North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 374-375 (99 SC 1755, 60 LE2d 286) (1979). If, however, an accused asserts his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, that is, if he "expresse[s] his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, [then he] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communications, exchanges, or conversations with the police." Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (101 SC 1880, 68 LE2d 378) (1981).</div><div class="casepar">Ross insists that he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel at his first appearance in the DeKalb magistrate court. As a consequence, Ross argues, since the subsequent interrogation was initiated by the police and not by Ross, the admissibility of the taped statement should have been governed by the "per se" rule established by Edwards v. Arizona (see Solem v. Stumes, ---- U. S. ---- (104 SC 1338, 79 LE2d 579) (1984)), rather than by the waiver standard of North Carolina v. Butler, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Ross's argument is premised upon an assumption with which we cannot agree, i.e., that Ross asserted his Miranda right to counsel or, in other words, "expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel."</div><div class="casepar">It is no doubt true that an accused has no affirmative obligation to state precisely why he wants a lawyer (see Johnson v. Virginia, 454 U. S. 920 (102 SC 422, 70 LE2d 231) (1981) (Marshall, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari)), but if he does, "surely from the circumstances of such a request we can find guidance as to the accused's state of mind, which is the key voluntariness inquiry." Collins v. Francis, 728 F2d 1322, 1333-34 (11th Cir. 1984). Ross volunteered two statements prior to his first appearance and one after. At no time during police interrogation did he express any desire to deal with police only through counsel or request that interrogation cease for any reason. Nor did he do so at his first appearance. Instead, he announced only his intention to retain the services of an attorney to represent him at his committal hearing. In these circumstances, we do not find Edwards v. Arizona to be applicable.</div><div class="casepar">Of course, an accused does not waive his Fifth Amendment right to counsel merely by his failure to assert it. However, in the absence of such an affirmative assertion, the North Carolina v. Butler standard of waiver applies, rather than the per se rule of Edwards v. Arizona.</div><div class="casepar">We find that Ross waived his Fifth Amendment right to an attorney when he was interrogated on September 4 and, therefore, find that the admission in evidence of the resulting taped confession was not Fifth Amendment error.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Alternatively, Ross contends that his first appearance in the DeKalb magistrate court was the kind of judicial proceeding that triggered his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and that a stricter standard of waiver applies to the Sixth Amendment right to counsel than to the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. See Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (84 SC 1199, 12 LE2d 246) (1964); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (97 SC 1232, 51 LE2d 424) (1977).</div><div class="casepar">We need not determine whether or to what extent the Sixth Amendment waiver standard is stricter than that of the Fifth Amendment, which in any event appears to be an unsettled question, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> because we conclude that Ross's first appearance was not an adversary judicial proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, while Massiah itself might reasonably support a conclusion that the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches only after an indictment (see Drake v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../842/4/index.html">245 Ga. 798 (1) (267 SE2d 237) (1980)</a></span>), subsequent cases clearly establish that the Massiah right to counsel attaches "at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the defendant," United States v. Gouveia, ---- U. S. ---- (104 SC 2292, 2297, 81 LE2d 146) (1984) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 688 (92 SC 1877, 32 LE2d 411) (1972)) (plurality opinion); " 'whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.' " Brewer v. Williams, supra, 430 U. S. at 398 (also quoting Kirby v. Illinois, supra.)</div><div class="casepar">However, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel clearly does not attach simply because the accused is in custody, or has been arrested. United States v. Gouveia, supra, 104 SC at 2299. Rather, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists to protect the accused "during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor" and thereafter. Ibid. Ross's first appearance was not such a confrontation. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> There was no prosecutor there, and no issues to resolve except to set a date for such a confrontation, at which time Ross would be represented by an attorney, and to determine if Ross needed the court to appoint an attorney (he did not). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Thus, the September 4 interrogation was not an abridgment of Ross's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, because that right had not yet attached.</div><div class="casepar">Since no Fifth or Sixth Amendment error occurred, Ross's third enumeration of error is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">4. During the Jackson-Denno hearing, three inmates testified for Ross that, when he was brought to his cell following the first two interrogations, he had visible bumps and bruises on his head. One of the three, Michael Butler, was called the next day by Ross to testify before the jury. On direct examination, he essentially repeated his Jackson-Denno testimony. On cross-examination, the state asked Butler if he knew more about the case than he was willing to admit.</div><div class="casepar">co-defendant who, unbeknownst to Massiah, was an undercover agent wired for sound.</div><div class="casepar">In contrast to the Miranda right to counsel, which attaches only if an accused is in police custody and subjected to police interrogation or its functional equivalent ( Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291 (100 SC 1682, 64 LE2d 297) (1980)), the Massiah right to counsel attaches once adversary judicial proceedings have commenced against the accused, whether or not he is in custody or is subjected to a police interrogation. Brewer v. Williams, supra; Massiah v. United States, supra; McLeod v. Ohio, 381 U. S. 356 (85 SC 1556, 14 LE2d 682) (1965).</div><div class="casepar">Butler answered that he did not. Butler next denied handing a note to the police officer who had transported him to the courtroom. However, when the state produced the note and suggested that it might refresh his memory from ten minutes previously, Butler admitted writing the note, which read as follows: "Mr. Robert E. Wilson, my name is Michael A. Butler. Mr. Wilson, if I help you pin Eddie Lee Ross, what will you do for me? He told me about the case. I will help you, if you help me. No tricks, Mr. Wilson. Help me. I will help you. I would like to talk to you alone. No tricks, Mr. Wilson."</div><div class="casepar">Further examination revealed that Ross had admitted to Butler that he had robbed, raped and killed an elderly woman and that "he was going to plead crazy or play crazy to beat his case."</div><div class="casepar">In his fourth enumeration of error, Ross alleges that the prosecutor's tactics were improper and that the trial court erred by denying Ross's timely motion for mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Ross first contends that it is obvious from Butler's testimony that the prosecutor had discussed Butler's testimony with him prior to his taking the stand as the first defense witness and that this discussion violated the rule of sequestration.</div><div class="casepar">The rule is that "either party shall have the right to have the witnesses of the other party examined out of the hearing of each other."

The rule does not prohibit discussions between an attorney to the case and a prospective witness, at least so long as the attorney talks to him separately from the other witnesses and does not inform him of previous testimony.

Butler responded affirmatively. Later examination revealed that although Butler had originally been charged as an "[a]ccessory to armed robbery and murder," the murder charge had been dropped.</div><div class="casepar">Ross argues that the foregoing testimony establishes that the state talked to Butler before he testified and that a "deal" had been reached. Therefore, he contends, the state's failure to correct Butler's "false" testimony that there was no deal violated Ross's right to due process of law. See Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150 (92 SC 763, 31 LE2d 104) (1972).</div><div class="casepar">We cannot agree that the record shows that the state allowed false testimony to go uncorrected. Butler testified that he had wanted to discuss the case with the district attorney, but attempts at telephonic communication had been unsuccessful; hence, the note. The state's question of Butler concerning his knowledge of the case is explained by its possession of the note (in which Butler plainly stated that Ross had told him about the case) and does not compel an inference that, contrary to Butler's testimony, he had previously discussed the case with the prosecution. Regarding the dropped murder charge, Butler apparently had never been accused of directly committing the crime, and, in any event, testimony that the charge had been dropped at some unspecified time for some unspecified reason is insufficient to demonstrate the falsity of Butler's positive testimony that there was no deal nor any discussion between him and the prosecution.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, other circumstances of the case are inconsistent with prior discussions or a deal. If Butler had succeeded in contacting the district attorney the previous day, he would have had no reason to pass a note to the district attorney (via the transporting officer) shortly before he testified. If he had successfully struck some sort of bargain with the state, in exchange for testimony incriminating Ross, he would not have had any reason to deny, initially, all knowledge of the case except for Ross's physical appearance after his arrest, nor any reason to continue the denial until confronted with the note. Finally, this was not a case in which the state sought incriminating testimony against one defendant from a co-defendant, which testimony would doubtless incriminate also the co-defendant, and, hence, would be protected by the co-defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. Butler had no such privilege, and therefore was "obliged to assist the authorities," with or without a deal. Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 558 (100 SC 1358, 63 LE2d 622) (1980).</div><div class="casepar">We do not find that the state allowed false testimony to go uncorrected.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Alternatively, Ross contends that even if there was no deal, but merely an offer of one, the state should have disclosed it under authority of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (83 SC 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963).</div><div class="casepar">Of course, Brady does not compel the state to disclose inculpatory evidence, and Butler's testimony concerning Ross's admissions was clearly inculpatory. Moreover, Brady does not require disclosure of evidence tending to impeach the credibility of a defense witness, since that ordinarily is not exculpatory. Ross, however, contends that, since Butler's incriminating testimony effectively converted him into a state's witness, the state was required, under Brady, to disclose any evidence tending to impeach Butler's testimony, including his offer to make a deal.</div><div class="casepar">Assuming that this contention is correct, the fact remains that the state did disclose this evidence, albeit only after Butler took the stand. The Brady rule "involves the discovery, after trial, of information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense." United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103 (96 SC 2392, 49 LE2d 342) (1976). (Emphasis supplied.) Brady itself does not require the pre-trial disclosure of exculpatory evidence and is not violated when the evidence is presented to the jury at trial. Castell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/7/index.html">250 Ga. 776</a></span> (2b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/7/index.html">301 SE2d 234</a></span>) (1983).</div><div class="casepar">The note was disclosed, and Ross was allowed extensive cross-examination on that issue. If Ross felt that his cross-examination was insufficient to bring out the whole truth in this regard, "the proper motion would have been for an adequate recess, not [a] mistrial." Wallin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/4/index.html">248 Ga. 29</a></span>, 34 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/4/index.html">279 SE2d 687</a></span>) (1981). Moreover, Ross has never demonstrated that the full truth was not revealed even though he had ample opportunity to do so after trial. See Rules IV (A) (5) (b) and IV (A) (6) of the Unified Appeal Procedure, as amended, 252 Ga. A-13 et seq. (Ross filed a motion for new trial, see fn. 1 of this opinion; however, no Brady or Giglio ground for new trial was raised. R. 126, 137.)</div><div class="casepar">There remains, then, only Ross's contention that, had the state disclosed the note before Butler took the stand (pre-trial disclosure obviously was not possible, since the note did not exist until the day Butler testified), Ross "could have made a reasoned decision whether to call Butler [as a defense witness] and thereby vouch for his credibility." This contention demonstrates no reversible error, for two reasons. First, the jury was never instructed that a party vouched for the credibility of a witness merely by calling him. Second, Ross was allowed to cross-examine Butler, dispelling any notion that Ross was vouchsafing Butler's credibility.</div><div class="casepar">Butler's testimony was obviously prejudicial, because it was incriminating. It was not inadmissible, however, and it would doubtless have been offered in any event. That is, prior disclosure of the note would not have resulted in the suppression of Butler's testimony. Nor has it been shown that prior disclosure would have revealed anything that was not brought out at trial. Thus, we find no reversible error in the delayed disclosure of the note.</div><div class="casepar">5. During the sentencing phase of the trial, the state offered evidence that Ross had murdered one elderly woman and raped another in two incidents unrelated to the crimes charged in the indictment in this case. At the tide this evidence was offered, Ross had not been indicted, tried, or convicted for either of these offenses. Ross's fifth and sixth enumerations of error complain of the introduction of this evidence in aggravation.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Ross complains that the state did not provide him with notice of the state's intention to present this evidence in aggravation until the day the trial began.</div><div class="casepar">We find no error here. The law provides that "only such evidence in aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant prior to his trial shall be admissible." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/2/index.html">17-10-2</a></span>. Notice was provided before the jury voir dire began and was therefore timely.</div><div class="casepar">(b) We find no merit to the contention that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that "you may provide for a life sentence for the accused for any reason that is satisfactory to you, or without any reason, if you care to do so." The charge was a correct statement of the law. We do not agree that giving the jury an absolute discretion to recommend mercy is unconstitutional. See Conner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/4/index.html">251 Ga. 113</a></span>, 119 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/4/index.html">303 SE2d 266</a></span>) (1983).</div><div class="casepar">(c) Ross's contention that the state could prove in aggravation only crimes for which Ross had been convicted is meritless for reasons stated in Devier v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../624/9/index.html">253 Ga. 604 (9) (323 SE2d 150) (1984)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Nor do we find any merit to Ross's contention that the court should have instructed the jury not to consider these "other" crimes in aggravation unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Ross had committed them.</div><div class="casepar">Georgia law does not allow the imposition of the death penalty unless the jury finds at least one statutory aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury must be so charged. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (c). However, once the jury crosses this threshold, it may consider all the evidence that has been presented in both phases of the case. Zant v. Stephens, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../674/6/index.html">250 Ga. 97 (297 SE2d 1) (1982)</a></span>. "In considering this evidence, the jury does not attempt to decide whether particular elements have been proved, but instead makes a unique, individualized judgment regarding the punishment that a particular person deserves. See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 602-605 [(98 SC 2954, 57 LE2d 973)] (1978)." Zant v. Stephens, ---- U. S.---- (103 SC 2733, 77 LE2d 235) (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).</div><div class="casepar">The admissibility of "other crime" evidence is a matter determined by the trial court. Felker v.

Once admitted, the jury is entitled to consider it, along with all the other evidence, in its deliberations on the ultimate question of whether to impose the death sentence. We discern no constitutional or statutory requirement that a jury must evaluate each and every evidentiary vignette pursuant to the reasonable doubt standard.</div><div class="casepar">6. On the issue of mitigating circumstances, the court charged as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, even if you find beyond a reasonable doubt the State has proved the existence of aggravating circumstances in this case which would justify the imposition of a death sentence, you are not required to recommend that the accused be put to death. You would be authorized, under the circumstances, to recommend the death penalty, but you are not required to do so.</div><div class="casepar">". . . You may provide for a life sentence for the accused for any reason that is satisfactory to you, or without any reason, if you care to do so."</div><div class="casepar">Under Georgia law, a jury should be informed that it can consider all of the evidence presented during both phases of the trial (guilt-innocence and sentence), Spivey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">241 Ga. 477</a></span>, 481 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../956/8/index.html">246 SE2d 288</a></span>) (1978); it should be instructed to consider mitigating circumstances, Hawes v.

State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../966/3/index.html">240 Ga. 142 (7) (240 SE2d 37) (1977)</a></span>. The charge in this case satisfied these requirements.</div><div class="casepar">Ross, however, contends that the instructions given were constitutionally inadequate because they do not "define" what mitigating circumstances are, nor "explain" their nature and function in the process of deliberations. As authority for this contention, he relies upon several decisions of the Fifth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals. See Morgan v. Zant, 743 F2d 775 (11th Cir. 1984); Finney v. Zant, 709 F2d 643 (11th Cir. 1983); Westbrook v. Zant, 704 F2d 1487 (11th Cir. 1983); and Spivey v. Zant, 661 F2d 464 (5th Cir., Unit B, 1981).</div><div class="casepar">We find these decisions to be inconsistent with pronouncements by the United States Supreme Court.</div><div class="casepar">In Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 271-272 (96 SC 2950, 49 LE2d 929) (1976), a plurality of the Supreme Court stated: "[I]n order to meet the requirement[s] of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, a capital-sentencing system must allow the sentencing authority to consider mitigating circumstances. In Gregg v. Georgia [428 U. S. 153 (96 SC 2909, 49 LE2d 859) (1976)], we today hold constitutionally valid [Georgia's] capital-sentencing system[,] [ which] directs the jury to consider any mitigating factors . . . The Texas statute does not explicitly speak of mitigating circumstances; it directs only that the jury answer three questions. Thus, the constitutionality of the Texas procedures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors."</div><div class="casepar">The plurality concluded that the second of these three statutory questions -- which asks the jury to determine "whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society" -- sufficiently allowed jury consideration of mitigating circumstances. Thus the Texas statute met the requirements of the Eighth Amendment.</div><div class="casepar">In our opinion, if the Texas statutory questions sufficiently focus a jury's attention on mitigating circumstances, then the charge in this case was constitutionally sufficient. We find unpersuasive the notion that the Texas system of three special interrogatories (only one of which arguably even authorizes the presentation of mitigating evidence) so much more satisfactorily focuses the jury's attention on the circumstances of the offense that a total lack of any instruction whatever on the concept of mitigating circumstances is constitutionally adequate, while in Georgia a sentencing charge is constitutionally deficient unless the jury is told "what a mitigating circumstance is and what its function is in the jury's sentencing deliberations." Spivey v. Zant, supra at 471.</div><div class="casepar">More recently, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Zant v. Stephens, supra, 103 SC at 2750, that "the Constitution does not require a State to adopt specific standards for instructing the jury in its consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances."</div><div class="casepar">"[W]e find it persuasive that the U. S. Supreme Court does not require that a jury in Georgia be instructed as to specific standards for weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances (i.e., the jury need not be instructed as to the function of mitigating circumstances), so long as the jury is allowed and instructed to consider any evidence in mitigation and is instructed, as here, that it has the discretion, notwithstanding proof of aggravating circumstances, to sentence the defendant to life in prison for any reason satisfactory to the jury or without any reason."
