Before Judge Forehand. Irwin Superior Court. April 16, 1954.</div><div class="casepresiding">MOBLEY, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the proof of the facts set up in the plaintiff's petition with regard to the claim of a parol gift of land must be such as to satisfy the minds of the jury to a reasonable certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt that such parol gift was made as alleged.</div><div class="casepar">2. The law as declared in Code  48-106 was applicable to the pleadings and the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The executors, and one of the defendants individually, filed their answers denying material allegations of the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Hansel Hudson, the husband of the petitioner, testified in part: He and petitioner were farming on halves in 1922, having a pretty hard time, and petitioner's father, Arthur Harper, told witness: "I got something over 700 acres down yonder, you all take the lower part of that down there . . . You all take it and go down there. Yes sir, that was my wife, Irma, and me. He said, you and Irma, you all take it and you can have it. Go down there. I don't want you working up here on halves. Take that land. It will be better than working on halves and we did." Witness and petitioner moved into a two-room negro house and lived on the western half of land lot number 245 for four years. They made pretty good crops and bought lumber and built a house. They put in new wire and a whole new fence. Witness's father got in bad health and they moved across town and rented the land. Thereafter they built a tobacco barn and a pack house. From the time Arthur Harper gave the place to petitioner until now, they did not pay any rent. He gave her that land, all the rest of that lot. He said he was giving it to her. Petitioner's father said there was a loan on the 740 acres, and he would have to pay off the debt before he could make a deed. Petitioner did not return the place for taxes, but she paid her father her part of the taxes. Petitioner's father worked trees on the place for turpentine in 1934 and 1935. Her father said, "Irma, I am in awful bad shape and condition." He made it all right with Irma. And she said, "Papa, you know that's best, whatever you do is all right with me." Petitioner's father sold timber from the land to build a house for one of his sons, but he made it all right with petitioner and she told him it would be all right.</div><div class="casepar">Various persons testified they farmed the place known as the Elisha Paulk place or Mrs. Irma Hudson's place and cultivated about 45 acres thereof as tenants of the latter for stated years. Other witnesses testified that Arthur Harper told them he had given the property to the petitioner.</div><div class="casepar">His will, which was executed January 2, 1953, devised to the petitioner and his other children each a certain number of acres of land, and directed that the property in question be sold for division. It was stipulated that the house, the tobacco barn, and other improvements put on the place are worth at least $1,500.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the petitioner. The defendants' amended motion for new trial was denied, and the exception is to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The first special ground of the amended motion for new trial complains that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury "that not only was the burden upon the plaintiff to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence, but that the proof of the facts set up in her petition with regard to the claim of a parol gift of land must be such as to satisfy the minds of the jury to a reasonable certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt that such parol gift was made as alleged."</div><div class="casepar">A reading of the entire charge shows that the trial court did not instruct the jury that any degree of proof beyond that of a preponderance of the evidence was necessary. While under the pleadings and evidence there were issues in the present case to which the preponderance-of-evidence rule as given was applicable, still, with respect to the alleged parol gift, the burden was on the petitioner to establish such gift to a moral and reasonable certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt by clear, strong, and satisfactory evidence. Christopher v. Mooty, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 286 (2)</span> (117 S. E. 90); Aultman v. Gibson, <span class="casemissing">172 Ga. 877 (2)</span> (159 S. E. 285); Crosby v. Higgs, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 314 (2)</span> (182 S. E. 10); Mickle v. Moore, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 150 (2)</span> (17 S. E. 2d 728); Barnes v. Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../197/17/index.html">206 Ga. 660</a></span>, 662 (58 S. E. 2d 400). Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury the right rule as to the degree of certainty imposed upon the petitioner with respect to the alleged parol gift.</div><div class="casepar">2. The fourth special ground complains of the charge: "The exclusive possession by a child of lands belonging originally to the father, without payment of rent, for the space of seven years, shall create conclusive presumption of a gift, and convey title to the child, unless there shall be evidence of a loan, or a claim of dominion by the father acknowledged by the child, or of a disclaimer of title by the child." Code  48-106.</div><div class="casepar">There being evidence, through conflicting, on the question of whether the petitioner had been in exclusive possession of the property under consideration for seven years, the court did not err in giving the above instruction to the jury. Mitchell v. Hunt, <span class="casemissing">185 Ga. 835 (2)</span> (196 S. E. 711).</div><div class="casepar">3. The second and third special grounds are elaborative of the usual general grounds. The second ground complains that the evidence was insufficient to clearly establish the alleged parol gift, and the third ground complains that the evidence was insufficient to show that this particular land was the subject matter of a parol gift from Arthur Harper to his daughter. These two grounds will be considered together.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence did not, as contended by counsel for the petitioner, demand a finding in her favor. "In an action in equity for specific performance of an alleged parol contract, the agreement must be proved so clearly, strongly, and satisfactorily as to leave no reasonable doubt as to the contract." Salmon v. McCrary, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 281 (1)</span> (29 S. E. 2d 58); Haynes v. Ellis, <span class="casemissing">199 Ga. 702 (2)</span> (35 S. E. 2d 151); First Nat. Bank &amp;c. Co. v. Falligant, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../192/55/index.html">208 Ga. 479</a></span>, 481 (67 S. E. 2d 473). The same strict rule applies where, as here, a daughter is claiming land under alleged parol gift from her deceased father. Poullain v. Poullain, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. 420 (2)</span> (4 S. E. 92).</div><div class="casepar">In the instant case, the only evidence of such parol gift was the testimony of Hansel Hudson, the petitioner's husband, to the effect that the petitioner's father told her that he had something over 700 acres down there and for her to take the lower part of it. There was evidence that this property was known as the Elisha Paulk place, but there was no evidence that the father in giving the place to his daughter identified it by that or any other name. The substance of what he said was that he owned over 700 acres down there and for her to take the lower part and that it would be hers.</div><div class="casepar">Applying the above-stated principle of law, the evidence was insufficient to establish a parol gift of the particular piece of land in controversy, as contended by counsel for the plaintiff in error; however, the petitioner was also claiming said property under the provisions of Code  48-106, and, as indicated in the second division of this opinion, the evidence, though conflicting on the question of whether the petitioner had been in exclusive possession of the property for seven years, was sufficient to support a finding in her favor under the provisions of the above-stated Code section.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
