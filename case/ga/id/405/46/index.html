Defendant Felton was awarded, on her counterclaim, contract damages and tort damages as well as attorney fees and punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">1. Both parties filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which were both ruled on by order of August 21, 1986. Prior to that ruling, however, on May 30, 1986, Glenridge had filed its notice of appeal in our Case No. 74334.

App. 854</a></span> (---- SE2d ----) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">The evidence ground involved Exhibit #8, two documents which Glenridge asserts should have been admitted. The first was a check in the amount of $5,556.37 to Felton in 1982 from the property management company of Glenridge for water damage in her unit. The other was a handwritten listing of repair costs allegedly included in this payment.</div><div class="casepar">In a motion in limine just before trial, Felton objected that the evidence was not relevant and improperly injected insurance into the case. Glenridge contended it showed that Felton had already been partially paid for the damages she was claiming and that she was accepting the benefits of, but refusIng to pay, her association fees. The court had granted Glenridge's motion for summary judgment as to her liability for the dues. The court tentatively ruled the evidence inadmissible but left open later reconsideration.</div><div class="casepar">In the course of the cross-examination of Felton, counsel for Glenridge attempted to question her concerning the payment she had received. At that point, a discussion was held off the record between counsel and the court. Counsel for Glenridge did then question Felton about the repairs done to her unit in 1982 and where they were located. She had no specific recall concerning these repairs, although she did acknowledge receipt of payment and stated that it was "about $4,000."</div><div class="casepar">When the check and handwritten notes were again proffered, Felton objected on hearsay grounds. The documents were hearsay and were not properly authenticated. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/1/index.html">24-3-1</a></span>; Rodgers v. Cumberland Volkswagen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../463/31/index.html">167 Ga.

Thus, the exclusion of these documents was not error.</div><div class="casepar">As to these, there is nothing to review. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/5/24/index.html">5-5-24</a></span>; AAA Van Svcs. v. Willis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../412/50/index.html">180 Ga.

We are unable to understand the claim of error since Glenridge requested that the trial court instruct on contract principles and the court did so. There is thus no error.</div><div class="casepar">5. Glenridge complains in enumeration nine of the court's giving of Felton's Requests to Charge Nos. 2 and 4, which dealt with one's obligation not to cause rainwater to flow other than naturally over the property of another. These two charges were objected to after the charge was given, only on the ground that there was no evidence of the alteration of flow by the Association. Additional grounds are argued on appeal and will not be considered. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/5/24/index.html">5-5-24</a></span>; AAA Van Svcs., supra; Eiberger, supra.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence of alterations made in the property by the management company, some in an apparent effort to correct the drainage problems. There was evidence from Felton and her witnesses, and from one of Glenridge's experts, that ponding around the foundation of the unit could cause damage to the foundation. This evidence authorized the charge.</div><div class="casepar">6. In enumerations eleven, twelve, and thirteen, Glenridge complains of the trial court's failure to give its written Requests to Charge Nos. 4, 7, and 12. The arguments made in the brief and the objections made at trial underline the need for clarity in making objections and in arguing, whether the objections concern the refusal to give a requested charge, or claimed error in the charge given, or an omission to charge although not requested. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/5/24/index.html">5-5-24</a></span>; Christiansen v. Robertson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/94/index.html">237 Ga. 711 (229 SE2d 472) (1976)</a></span> (adequacy of objection to erroneous charge and an omission to charge, although no request made); Continental Cas. Co. v. Union Camp Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../127/26/index.html">230 Ga. 8 (195 SE2d 417) (1973)</a></span> (refusal to give written request to charge); Kres v. Winn-Dixie Stores, supra. Here, there was a written request to charge No. 12 below; that charge was given as requested. Plaintiff's Request No. 2 was not given, but that failure is not enumerated as error and is deemed abandoned. Clark v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../413/58/index.html">180 Ga. App. 280</a></span>, 282 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../413/58/index.html">348 SE2d 916</a></span>) (1986); MacDonald v. MacDonald, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../505/85/index.html">156 Ga. App. 565</a></span>, 566 (1) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../505/85/index.html">275 SE2d 142</a></span>) (1980). The brief fails to enlighten as to what it is Glenridge intended to argue here.</div><div class="casepar">Glenridge's Request No. 4, which was not given and was properly reserved, enumerated, and argued, was: "In order to recover on a claim of negligence, Defendant [Felton] also must show that any injury or loss to her unit was not the result of her own actions or neglect, in whole or in part." (Emphasis in original.) Felton objected during the charge conference on the ground that it was an incorrect statement of the law in that it improperly placed the burden on a party to disprove his own negligence. We agree. While comparative negligence is available as an affirmative defense in Georgia, see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/11/7/index.html">5-11-7</a></span>, the burden of proving it remains with the party relying upon it and not upon the party making the original negligence claim to disprove it.

Co., <span class="casemissing">126 Ga. 710</span>, 711(<span class="casemissing">55 SE 948</span>) (1906); Falkner v.

App. 27 (1) (289 SE2d 1) (1982)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Glenridge's Request to Charge No. 7 dealt with the statute of limitation for suits against developers for construction defects, as provided in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/30/index.html">9-3-30</a></span>. Felton objected during the charge conference, and Glenridge did except to the court's refusal to give it. The omission of the charge was not error. Failure to plead the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations results in its being waived. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/8/index.html">9-11-8</a></span> (c); Owens v. Owens, <span class="casemissing">248 Ga. 720</span>, 722 (3) (<span class="casemissing">286 SE2d 25</span>) (1982). It had not been pled.</div><div class="casepar">7. Lastly, Glenridge complains of the trial court's failure to direct a verdict for it on the issue of attorney fees on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of the amount of the fees claimed and the reasonable value of the Services rendered. Glenridge did not move for directed verdict on this ground nor include it in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, both of which are prerequisites to our review of the question. Joseph v. Bray, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/03/index.html">182 Ga. App. 131 (1) (354 SE2d 878) (1987)</a></span>; Grabowski v.

Her enumerations three and five attack the denial of her motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. No motion for directed verdict was made as to either ground of the motion for judgment n.o.v., as required by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (b), and will not be considered. Battle v. Yancey Bros., Supra.</div><div class="casepar">9. Enumeration four complains of the court's submission to the jury of the issue of attorney fees, but Felton did not object until after the charge. She did not move for directed verdict on this ground, and that would have been the only device for eliminating the question from the jury's consideration during trial. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span>. The argument here concerns her claim that the theory of "set-off" prevented the jury from considering the issue; it was not properly presented to the trial court, providing nothing for us to review. In addition, any set-off of judgment is still available to both parties. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/13/75/index.html">9-13-75</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">10. In her first enumeration, Felton objects to the court's allowance of Glenridge's second amendment to its complaint on the day trial began. Plaintiff's original complaint filed in December 1983 claimed assessments due under the declaration and bylaws of the condominium association up through the date of filing and claimed all future assessments. A few months later, plaintiff moved for summary judgment, seeking $2,242.64 due in assessments and late fees through the date of the accompanying affidavit. The court granted that motion, and in December 1985, plaintiff amended its complaint to seek the assessments and late fees through the end of November and filed a "Motion to Amend Judgment," seeking to add this money to its previously-won summary judgment. We find no order deciding this motion. On the day of trial plaintiff filed another amendment, seeking the assessments and late fees through March 1986, in the total sum of $5,765.90. Felton objected.</div><div class="casepar">During the trial, plaintiff Glenridge submitted evidence, unobjected to by Felton, that through March 1986, she owed assessments and late fees of $5,465.90. The court granted Glenridge's motion for directed verdict for these assessments and fees.</div><div class="casepar">The second amendment was not needed to raise and try the issue of assessments due as of the date of trial. The original complaint claimed all assessments due as of that date and "all future assessments accruing after Nov. 1, 1983, which remain unpaid." The unobjected-to first amendment added the late fees. Thus, at the time of the second amendment, the only change made was in the total claimed. Allowing the amendment was not error. Abernethy v. Cates, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/99/index.html">182 Ga. App. 456</a></span>, 460 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/99/index.html">356 SE2d 62</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">11. Felton complains that the trial court erred in granting judgment for $5,465.90 when the motion for directed verdict was only in the amount of $5,270. While the motion did allude to the smaller figure, it was a mere lapsus lingue, and the evidence reflected the $5,465.90 due. The court was required, as it did, to grant the verdict based on the evidence, not the statement of counsel. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (a).</div><div class="casepar">12.

Although we have had to plod through numerous enumerations of error which were defective because not properly raised below and so should not have been asserted, consideration of the whole case does not lead us to the conclusion that it was appealed for delay only.
