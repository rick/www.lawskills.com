Before Judge Brogdon.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">These are interlocutory appeals from the denial in part of motions for summary judgment by Corporate Property Investors, owners of Lenox Square Shopping Mall, Pembroke Management, Inc., management company for the mall, Minasha Fernanders, a Lenox Square security guard, and Officer Constance A. Locke, the Atlanta Police Department (APD), who was on beat patrol responding to a dispatch to Lenox; their motions were denied as to Captain Ronald C. Milon's, a Northwest Airlines pilot, claims against them for negligence, false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, malicious prosecution, and punitive damages. The trial court erred in denying summary judgment on the claims for assault and battery; the trial court is affirmed as to the denial of summary judgment for claims of negligence, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and punitive damages as to all the defendants except Officer Locke. Officer Locke is entitled to summary judgment under discretionary immunity.</div><div class="casepar">On December 18, 1996, while passing Episodes Clothing Store, Fernanders allegedly saw someone, who appeared to be Captain Milon, placing a white blouse into a black bag. She went into the store and approached the plaintiff who had a black bag, tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention. When the security officer approached Milon, he had laid an off-white blouse down on a counter, but again had it in his possession when Officer Locke arrived, because he testified that he was in the process of purchasing it. Fernanders requested that Milon leave the store with her, which he refused to do, saying that this must be a joke; Milon continued shopping for five or ten minutes. At no time did Fernanders identify herself or tell Milon what she wanted or question the employees in the store, regarding the belief that Milon had attempted to shoplift from their store.</div><div class="casepar">Fernanders reported by radio to her supervisor that she had witnessed a customer attempting to shoplift at Episodes and asked "for a backup police officer." The supervisor called APD; it was reported to APD that "there was a shoplifting in progress," and Officer Locke responded. Outside Episodes, Fernanders told Officer Locke outside Episodes that "she witnessed Mr. Milon take a white blouse, conceal it in his tote bag, and attempt to walk out of the store[; he] saw her standing there and immediately turned around, put the bag down, grabbed the blouse, and put it either back out on the shelf or hung it up." Fernanders pointed out Captain Milon, who was still inside Episodes, to Locke as the attempted shoplifter.</div><div class="casepar">Captain Milon denied attempting to place the blouse in his child's tote bag or even opening it in Episodes and stated he never saw Fernanders until she spoke to him. The assistant manager of Episodes assisted Milon when he entered the store while he selected an off-white blouse and a pants suit for his wife.</div><div class="casepar">On cross-examination, Fernanders admitted that she never witnessed Captain Milon remove a white blouse from his bag. But Fernanders had previously told Locke and the magistrate that she had witnessed Milon place a garment in the bag and then remove the garment, which had been relied upon to establish probable cause for the arrest and bindover. At the preliminary hearing attended only by Fernanders for the prosecution, Fernanders revealed that as she was passing by the store window, she had seen Milon putting the blouse in the bag through an array of mannequins from a distance of 45 feet.</div><div class="casepar">Officer Locke approached Captain Milon based on the allegations made by Fernanders alone, and Milon saw Fernanders with Officer Locke and responded defensively and belligerently as a black man previously falsely suspected of shoplifting by Fernanders while Christmas shopping for his wife. Officer Locke asked where the black bag was, and he answered, "what bag?" Then Milon told Officer Locke that his child's black tote bag was in the chair. Neither Officer Locke nor Fernanders made any investigation or questioned any of the employees of Episodes prior to or even after arresting Milon. Thus, based upon her experience, Officer Locke concluded that Milon's demeanor indicated his guilt to her. Therefore, Officer Locke arrested Milon based upon his demeanor, response, and Fernanders' statement. Based only on the facts told her by Fernanders and her subjective opinion of Milon's attitude, she immediately placed Milon under arrest.</div><div class="casepar">Based upon Fernanders' testimony alone, Captain Milon was bound over by the magistrate. In the State Court of Fulton County, the charge of shoplifting was nolle prossed against Milon.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A01A0706</div><div class="casepar">1. The defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying summary judgment to them as to negligence, false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, malicious prosecution, and punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The defendants contend that they are shielded from liability for false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution, because Officer Locke exercised her own professional judgment in making the arrest of Captain Milon for attempted shoplifting without the influence of Fernanders. See Jacobs v. Shaw, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../283/56/index.html">219 Ga. App. 425</a></span>, 426 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../283/56/index.html">465 SE2d 460</a></span>) (1995). Had the evidence revealed that Officer Locke, in fact, made an independent investigation, as was her professional duty to do, and based her decision to arrest Milon on her independent investigation and the statements of Fernanders, then there would be a basis upon which professional judgment was exercised, and such would constitute a defense. However, merely to assert that Officer Locke exercised her professional judgment based on no probative facts, other than those told to her by Fernanders, some of which Fernanders now admits that she did not see, fails to constitute the predicate for the defense of the exercise of independent professional judgment by the on-duty police officer, because Officer Locke acted solely on the facts urged by another without any independent investigation to corroborate such allegations. See id. at 426-427 (1); McLeod v. Pruco Life Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/73/index.html">215 Ga. App. 177</a></span>, 179-180 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/73/index.html">449 SE2d 895</a></span>) (1994). Further, plaintiff's evidence controverts Officer Locke's affidavit and testimony Jacobs v. Shaw, supra at 426.</div><div class="casepar">In Jacobs v. Shaw, supra at 426, the professional judgment of the nonparty officer was based upon the prosecution witness' statement, misrepresentations made by the accused regarding the prosecuting witness' statement, on-scene investigation, review of the report by the state regulatory agency after checking the gas pump for accuracy, the accused's statement, and professional experience. Id. at 427. In McLeod v. Pruco Life Ins. Co., supra at 178-179, the detective based his professional judgment upon two witnesses' statements obtained in the investigation, circumstantial evidence that the accused only had access to the money determined by investigation, and the officer's independent investigation. In contrast, in this case the only alleged facts upon which probable cause could be based was the statement of Fernanders as to what she allegedly saw.</div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, as a party and not as a disinterested witness, unlike the above cases, Officer Locke's statement that the arrest was based upon her professional judgment constitutes a mere statement of self-serving opinion and a legal conclusion that cannot support the grant of summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">[W]e must give full weight to the rule that a jury, not a judge, may construe the facts upon which such opinion is based and reach a diametrically different conclusion to that reached by the witness. . . . Thus, on opinion evidence alone, a summary judgment is not demanded as a matter of law, although such opinion evidence is always sufficient to make a jury issue.</div><div class="casepar">(Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)

App. 105</a></span>, 107 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../253/18/index.html">495 SE2d 583</a></span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">(b) If all of what Fernanders told Officer Locke was proven to be true, then this would constitute probable cause for the arrest. However, there exists a compelling issue of the credibility of Fernanders. Fernanders made material, prior inconsistent statements to both Officer Locke and the magistrate that she saw Captain Milon take the blouse out of the bag and put it back on the shelf, but on deposition she admitted that she had not seen Milon take the blouse out of the bag. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Further, there exist facts tending to disprove what Fernanders testified to having seen, i.e., (1) the fact that she allegedly observed what she claims while walking by the store window handing out security flyers 45 feet away and through a mannequin-crowded store window; (2) the fact that the child's black tote bag allegedly held the blouse with all the other items in it already; (3) the fact that the store personnel did not see Milon open the bag while he was being helped by the manager; and (4) the fact that the plaintiff denied everything that Fernanders said that she saw. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> These questions of credibility and conflict in the evidence can be resolved only by a jury. See Foster v. Ramsey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../214/69/index.html">245 Ga. App. 118</a></span>, 119 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../214/69/index.html">536 SE2d 550</a></span>) (2000); Harding v. Ga. Gen. Ins.

Ramsey, supra at 120.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Where a prosecuting witness urges the arrest and prosecution of another without adequate investigation to determine if there exists a reasonable basis to believe that probable cause exists, such individual risks tort liability if there exists no probable cause to reasonably believe that the plaintiff committed a crime. See Ellis v. Knowles, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../705/12/index.html">90 Ga. App. 40</a></span>, 42 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../705/12/index.html">81 SE2d 884</a></span>) (1954); see also Nicholl v.

In this case, Fernanders, when the testimony that is in conflict is construed most strongly against Captain Milon, thought only that she saw Milon attempting to put a blouse in a black bag, which, if true, could have several reasonable inferences pointing to innocence, as well as guilt, and requiring further investigation.</div><div class="casepar">In deciding if the belief of the prosecutor was reasonable, the prosecutor must have determined "that [the] apparent state of facts which seem[ed] to exist after reasonable and proper inquiry [by the exercise of] the duty of caution and avoidance of haste [constituted probable cause]."

If a reasonable person would have investigated to determine if probable cause existed prior to urging an arrest and prosecution, then such failure to make an investigation may imply malice, as well as go to whether probable cause existed.

The defendants did not control the time, manner, or method of the officer's performance of her official duties; therefore, the officer's conduct could not be imputed to them. Beck v. Paideia School, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../375/02/index.html">191 Ga. App. 183</a></span>, 184 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../375/02/index.html">381 SE2d 132</a></span>) (1989). Further, Officer Locke did not work off duty for the defendants. Welton v. Ga. Power Co., supra at 19-20.</div><div class="casepar">2. The defendants contend that they cannot be liable under a theory of negligence for any damages sustained by Captain Milon from his arrest, detention, and prosecution, because there is no action for negligent false arrest, negligent false imprisonment, and negligent prosecution. However, plaintiff asserts a claim sounding in negligence, because "[t]here is no such tort [as negligent false arrest or negligent false imprisonment]. To constitute a false imprisonment [or false arrest], the act of the defendant in [arresting or] confining the plaintiff must be done with the intention of causing [an arrest or] confinement." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Stewart v. Williams, <span class="casemissing">243 Ga. 580</span>, 581 (1) (<span class="casemissing">255 SE2d 699</span>) (1979). By definition a negligent act cannot be malicious, because acting with malice is an intentional act as opposed to a careless act. See Southern v. Sphere-Drake Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/25/index.html">226 Ga. App. 450</a></span>, 452 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/25/index.html">486 SE2d 674</a></span>) (1997). However, in this case, the traditional elements of negligence apply, i.e., (1) a legal duty to exercise ordinary care to protect others from an unreasonable risk of harm; (2) a breach of the standard of care; (3) a legally attributable causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) some loss or damage flowing to plaintiff's legally protected interest as a result of the breach of duty. Bradley Center v. Wessner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../677/3/index.html">250 Ga. 199</a></span>, 200 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../677/3/index.html">296 SE2d 693</a></span>) (1982).</div><div class="casepar">If the [arrest and] confinement [are] due to the defendant[s'] negligence, the latter may be liable as for negligence, but the action is then governed by the rules and principles of the tort of negligence, according to which the plaintiff is required to show actual damage. In other words, there can be no such tort as [negligent false arrest or] negligent false imprisonment which of itself makes the defendant liable without proof of the invasion of some interest other than the bare interest in freedom from [arrest and] confinement.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A01A0707</div><div class="casepar">3. Officer Locke contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion for summary judgment under discretionary immunity while acting under color of law. We agree and reverse.</div><div class="casepar">Officer Locke took the alleged facts reported to her by Fernanders as true without making a professional police investigation and allowed her own personal feelings that a belligerent, hostile attitude by an African-American male accused of a crime was an indication of guilt rather than the righteous outrage of an innocent, law-abiding citizen cloud her professional judgment, causing her to rush to judgment prematurely.</div><div class="casepar">In good faith, Officer Locke believed that at the time of the arrest all the facts alleged by Fernanders were true, that Fernanders saw Captain Milon stuff a blouse into a black bag and that he saw her watching him and removed the blouse from the bag; thus, Officer Locke had a factual basis for probable cause at the time of arrest, although such would constitute unprofessional police work without an independent investigation to avoid making a mistake as occurred in this case. See Barnett v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../331/15/index.html">204 Ga. App. 491</a></span>, 493 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../331/15/index.html">420 SE2d 43</a></span>) (1992); Ellis v. State, <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. App. 366</span>, 367-368 (2) (<span class="casemissing">296 SE2d 726</span>) (1982). As a trained professional police officer, Officer Locke should have known that prosecuting witnesses generally tell the truth as they know it to be or believe it to be but also can be mistaken as to what they believe they saw or may either intentionally and falsely fill in facts as to what they saw with fictional details or in good faith selectively fill in gaps with what they saw to match their preconceptions, prejudices, or conclusions. Also, witnesses may simply lie from a hidden motive. An investigation is designed to corroborate these alleged facts by other witnesses and to determine the reliability and veracity of the prosecuting witness and the accused to determine if probable cause does in fact exist and not to burden the courts with groundless accusations of imagined criminal conduct. It is for this reason that police officers have broad discretionary judgment in making an arrest, which discretion should never be abdicated by inaction, pressure, persuasion, or prejudice.</div><div class="casepar">Officer Locke's conduct, while unprofessional, was not wilful, fraudulent, corrupt, or malicious; therefore, she enjoyed limited immunity. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/36/33/4/index.html">36-33-4</a></span>; Hennessy v.

City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../331/63/index.html">204 Ga. App. 621</a></span>-622 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../331/63/index.html">420 SE2d 75</a></span>) (1992); Price v. Owen, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 58</span>, 60-61 (<span class="casemissing">19 SE2d 529</span>) (1942). For Officer Locke to be liable, there must be not only an absence of probable cause, but also malice. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/7/1/index.html">51-7-1</a></span>; Smith v. Trust Co. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../295/69/index.html">215 Ga.
