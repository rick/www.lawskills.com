Where the purported written demand is insufficient to constitute legal notice, penalties and attorney's fees for bad faith will not lie. The court erred in overruling special demurrers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.</div><div class="casepar">This case comes to this court on appeal from the City Court of Savannah to the overruling of the defendant's general and special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">The suit, as originally brought by Wadean Fountain, by her father and next friend, as plaintiff, against General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., as defendant, claims damages in the amount of $10,000 for injuries suffered by the plaintiff, as the result of the negligence of the school bus driver, John Polite, and one Mrs. Lela B. Sproul, who is alleged to have had general supervision of the school bus while it was being operated by John Polite at the time and on the occasion now under consideration. Both Mrs. Sproul and John Polite are alleged to have been employees, agents and servants of the Board of Education for the City of Savannah and the County of Chatham. The petition alleges further that the bus on which the petitioner was riding on said occasion was equipped for invalid children with wheel chairs and also equipped with safety belts, except that the petition alleges that there were no safety belts at the place where the petitioner was placed on said bus; that at the time of the accident complained of the school bus was being used to transport children from their school, "The Trustees' Garden Village School for Crippled Children," to a picnic area; that the bus hit a hole in the road causing the wheel chair in which the petitioner was seated to turn over; that the petitioner's head was thrown against the arm of the wheel chair; that she suffered injuries for which she brought direct action against the defendant, General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., Ltd., plaintiff in error here; that the negligence charged to the driver of the school bus, John Polite, and to Mrs. Lela B. Sproul was as follows: negligence in placing the wheel chair where there was no safety belt provided; in disregarding the condition of the road and the safety of the children in the bus; in not standing by the wheel chair to prevent it from falling; in failing to tie the wheel chair to the bus to prevent it from falling; in the selection of the road used to go to the picnic area under the circumstances then prevailing; in selecting such road when it was known that the wheel chair was not tied or fastened to the bus; and in not driving the bus in such manner as to avoid the hole in the road. Petitioner alleges further that Code (Ann.)  32-429 -- 32-433 (Ga. L. 1949, pp. 1155, 1156) give to her, as a school child riding on a school bus, the right to sue the insurance carrier directly. The defendant, plaintiff in error here, filed both general and special demurrers to the suit. By amendment petitioner attached a copy of the insurance policy sued on; the plaintiff in error renewed its demurrers to the petition as amended and petitioner again amended her petition by asking for additional damages of $2,500 for 25% penalties and $2,500 for reasonable attorney's fees on the ground of alleged bad faith on the part of the plaintiff in error after demand for settlement had been made; the plaintiff in error again renewed its general demurrer and filed seven special demurrers to the suit, as twice amended. The court overruled the general demurrer and special demurrers 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, but failed to rule on special</div><div class="casepar">demurrer number 4, and therefore that particular demurrer is not before the court at this time. To these rulings exceptions were taken and the case is here for review.</div><div class="casepar">Under the provisions of Sec. 1 of the 1949 act of the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1155; Code, Ann.,  32-429), "The various school boards of the counties, cities and independent school systems employing school buses, are hereby authorized and required to cause policies of insurance to be issued insuring the school children riding therein to and from school against bodily injury or death at any time therefrom resulting from an accident or collision in which said buses are involved. The amount of such insurance shall be within the discretion of the respective boards" (emphasis ours), it became mandatory upon the members of the Board of Education for the City of Savannah and the County of Chatham to cause policies of insurance to be issued insuring the school children as provided in said act and Code section. And since the law presumes that all public officials will do their duty it must be presumed that the members of the Board of Education for the City of Savannah and the County of Chatham did their duty under the mandate of Sec. 1. of the 1949 act, supra, and that the policy issued in accordance with the statutory provisions thereof. Curtis v. Girard Fire &amp;c. Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 854</span> (11 S. E. 2d 3); State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../686/34/index.html">98 Ga. App. 46</a></span> (104 S. E. 2d 725), and cases cited.</div><div class="casepar">2. Wherever the language or provisions in an insurance policy are in conflict with the language or provisions of the act of the legislature, which required the purchase of the insurance policy, the language or provisions of the act take precedence, and must prevail over the policy.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where, as in this case, both in the caption and in the body of the act of 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 1155, supra), the language used conclusively shows that the legislature intended to require the various school boards to insure the school children for injuries received while being transported to and from school, regardless of whether there be negligence on the part of school employees, servants or agents in the operation of the school buses, the policy of insurance so issued is an accident policy and not a liability policy. State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../686/34/index.html">98 Ga. App. 46</a></span>, 58, supra. Moreover, where as in this case the petition alleges that the suit is brought pursuant to the provisions of the said 1949 act, supra, and where the attached policy of insurance itself fails to negative such allegation, and in the absence of any affirmative showing in the petition contrary to such allegation, the petition states a cause of action sufficient to withstand general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">Since the policy issued under the act of 1949, supra, was an accident policy as to school children, the school child was entitled to recover from the insurer on the basis of the policy issued, and the coverage supplied by the "rider" or "endorsement" attached thereto which provided $500 coverage for medical, surgical, dental and other services incurred within one year from the date of the accident, was in addition to the benefits provided by the accident policy itself. This "rider" or "endorsement" had the effect of increasing the possible limits of coverage to as much as $10,500 if the school child's "medical" amounted to $500 within one year from the time the injuries were sustained.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special demurrer 3 of the plaintiff in error attacks the petition on the ground that it shows a misjoinder of causes of action, ex delicto and ex contractu, in that the petition as originally drawn, was predicated on negligence, whereas the last amendment to the petition sounds in contract. With this contention we cannot agree. It is the holding of this court that the various acts of negligence charged in the petition are merely historical of the facts, alleged to have led up to and culminated in petitioner's injuries. We also hold in this opinion that this is a suit ex contractu, based on an accident insurance policy, as contemplated under the 1949 act, supra, under the provisions of which it is alleged this action is brought.</div><div class="casepar">5. Special demurrers 5 and 6 are addressed to paragraphs 29 and 30 of the petition, as amended, and attack them on the grounds that they are vague and indefinite. These demurrers are well taken and should have been sustained. The letter which is attached to the petition, identified as petitioner's Exhibit "b", and which purports to be the written demand made upon the plaintiff in error by petitioner's attorney, cannot under the most liberal interpretation be construed as such a demand as would constitute notice as contemplated by law. The letter, as an exhibit, must take precedence over the allegations in the petition and it in fact does nothing more than inform the plaintiff in error that the writer of the letter has been retained as counsel for petitioner in her claim for injuries, and requests that the plaintiff in error contact him in regard to the claim. Furthermore, the petition does not mention anything of the nature of the demand or any condition of it.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in overruling special demurrers 5 and 6 of the plaintiff in error.</div><div class="casepar">6. Special demurrers 7, 8 and 9 of the plaintiff in error attacking the allegations in the petition with reference to bad faith, penalties and attorney's fees need not be dealt with extensively by the court since we have already held in Division 5 of this opinion there was not sufficient demand to constitute legal notice and under that ruling it necessarily follows that these demurrers should have been sustained.</div><div class="casepar">FELTON, Chief Judge, concurring specially.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Lewis, Wylly &amp; Javetz, Jack H.
