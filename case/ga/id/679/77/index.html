An assignment of error that clearly presents a legal question for consideration of the reviewing court is sufficiently specific.</div><div class="casepar">2. Although a motion to open a default is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, such discretion must always be exercised in accordance with the law.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where, as in this case, the petition sets forth a cause of action, though it be imperfect in form and open to timely special demurrers, its imperfection affords no reason for opening a default.</div><div class="casepar">W. R. Godfrey filed suit for malicious prosecution against Home Stores, Inc., in the Superior Court of Floyd County. The petition alleged that the plaintiff was given a check in the amount of $31 by George Nabors; that the plaintiff went to the defendant's store, selected certain articles for purchase and proceeded to the check-out stand where the plaintiff exhibited the check to A. G. Harper, manager of the store; that Harper snatched the check from the plaintiff's hand, said it was worthless and called the police; that Harper, the manager of the store, did not cash the check nor did the plaintiff receive any money or the articles he had selected for purchase; that Harper ascertained that Nabors was in the adjacent parking lot from the plaintiff, followed the plaintiff to the parking lot where Nabors was sitting and stayed with Nabors and the plaintiff until the police arrived; that when the police arrived the plaintiff was incarcerated in jail and held for a period of three weeks; that on March 30, 1957, Harper, manager of the store, agent and employee of defendant, procured through Billy Hart, a warrant for the plaintiff's arrest; that on April 19, 1957, the plaintiff was brought before the city recorder who had issued the warrant and after preliminary hearing, the charges against the plaintiff of being a common cheat and swindler were dismissed; that Harper counseled, confederated, and advised with Billy Hart to bring the prosecution when they knew he was not guilty; that the charges set forth in the warrant were false and malicious, and there was an entire want of probable cause; that the plaintiff was injured in his reputation and health and brought to public scandal, infamy and disgrace among his neighbors, friends, and other good and worthy citizens of the State and divers of his neighbors, friends, relatives and citizens to whom his innocence in the premises was not known and by reason of such charges suspected and believed and still believe that he is guilty of the charges of being a common cheat and swindler; that the plaintiff has suffered great anxiety and pain both mentally and physically; that the acts constitute malicious prosecution and the plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages in the amount of $7,500.</div><div class="casepar">The warrant and affidavit were attached as exhibits to the petition. The warrant charged the plaintiff with the offense of attempted cheating and swindling. The affidavit stated as follows: "Attempted cheating and swindling by presenting to be cashed at the Home Store on Maple Street a check in the amount of $31.00 on the First National Bank of Rome signed by George Nabors which was a worthless check and knowing that the check was worthless."</div><div class="casepar">The petition was filed on April 3, 1959, and the defendant was served on the same date. On May 18, 1959, the suit was in default as a matter of law, because no defensive pleadings had been filed. One June 4, 1959, the defendant filed a motion to open the default which stated the following: that the defendant is a nonresident corporation with its principal office in Chattanooga, Tennessee; that a copy of the petition was served on Arnold Pittman on April 3, 1959, who sent it to the home office in Chattanooga; that on April 20, 1959, the defendant's supervisor, Ray Womble, turned the copy over to A. G. Harper for the purpose of making arrangements for the defense of the case in Rome, Georgia, but before Harper got to Rome, he lost the copy of the petition on or about April 24, 1959'; that Harper did not know or understand that the petition had to be answered by a certain date, but Harper came to Rome on May 28, 1959, to see about a matter and talked to the Sheriff of Floyd County who informed him that he did not think there was any basis for the case and thought nothing would come of it, whereupon Harper returned to Chattanooga. Later on May 28, 1959, the sheriff telephoned Harper in Chattanooga and told him he had better get a lawyer. On June 2, 1959, Harper talked with attorneys in Rome, Georgia, about the case and found, for the first time, that the same was in default; that the petition fails to set forth a cause of action because it shows on its face that it is barred by the statute of limitations; that the defendant has a meritorious defense as set forth by his answer and demurrer, which are proffered for filing contemporaneously herewith, and copies of which are attached and made a part of the motion; that all costs have been paid.</div><div class="casepar">On June 26, 1959, the trial court allowed the case to be opened by entering the following order: "After the overruling of plaintiff's motion to dismiss dedendant's motion to open the default in the within case, the within motion to open default coming on to be heard, after argument of counsel, said motion to open default is hereby granted, and defendant is hereby authorized to file the proffered demurrer and answer in said case instanter upon payment of the accrued costs in the amount of $14.00, and said default is hereby opened."</div><div class="casepar">On August 31, 1959, the demurrer came on in regular order, the court sustained the general demurrer and dismissed the petition. To the order of June 28, 1959, opening the default and to the order of August 31, 1959, sustaining the general demurrer, the plaintiff excepts, and assigns them as error for review of this court.</div><div class="casepar">1. The assignments of error are not too general, insufficient, or vague so as to be denied consideration by this court. The court is able to ascertain the legal questions raised by the plaintiff in error. Anderson v. Newton, <span class="casemissing">123 Ga. 512</span> (51 S. E. 508).</div><div class="casepar">2. Defendants to a suit must file all pleadings on or before the time stated in the process as appearance day. Code (Ann.)  81-301. In the event such pleadings are not filed, the case is considered in default, but may be opened as a matter of right within 15 days after appearance day upon payment of cost. Code (Ann.)  110-401. The method by which a default may be opened and defensive pleadings filed is prescribed by Code (Ann.)  110-404. Wallis v. McMurry, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../704/06/index.html">91 Ga. App. 549</a></span> (86 S. E. 2d 529). Although a motion to open a default is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, such discretion must always be exercised in accordance with the law. McMurria Motor Co. v. Bishop, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../716/07/index.html">86 Ga. App. 750</a></span>, 754 (72 S. E. 2d 469); Green v. Whitehead, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 274</span> (49 S. E. 2d 527).</div><div class="casepar">Coker v. Eison, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 835</span> (151 S. E. 682) holds that the fact that a party relies upon the advice of "those he thought" knew the law as to when he should file his pleadings is no excuse for failure on his part to comply with the statute's requirement in that regard. A party is not justified in ignoring the process of the court by acting on advice alone. See also Davison-Paxon Co. v. Burkart, <span class="casemissing">92 Ga. App. 80</span> (88 S. E. 2d 39). A defendant must use diligence to learn the contents of such notice of a pending suit. McMurria Motor Co. v. Bishop, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../716/07/index.html">86 Ga. App. 750</a></span>, 754, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Applying the above principles of law to the instant case, we conclude that the trial judge erred in opening the default. The only facts set out in the defendant's motion to show an excuse for failing to plead is that the defendant's agent did not know or understand that the suit must be answered by a certain date. Under the above authorities, the defendant would not be entitled to rely upon such advice and ignore the court's process. Coker v. Eison, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 835</span>, supra. But even if the advice of the good sheriff should be considered a valid excuse for Harper's delay in entering the defensive pleadings, the delay was not caused by any conversation Harper had with the sheriff. This is apparent because when the conversation occurred the time for filing defensive pleadings in the case had already expired. The time fixed by statute for filing defensive pleadings was May 18, 1959, and the conversation did not take place until May 28, 1959. By that time the suit was already in default.</div><div class="casepar">As to the allegations that Harper did not know or understand that the suit must be answered by a certain date, the defendant did not set forth facts to support this contention, and without such additional facts being pleaded, the motion does not show excusable neglect on the defendant's part. The copy of the petition and process passed through two other agents of the defendant corporation before reaching Harper. The motion makes no explanation of the delay of these agents in transmitting the papers to Harper, nor is any reason given as to why Harper could not have become informed as to the time of filing defensive pleadings in response to the petition and process. This case is very similar to Davison-Paxon Co. v. Burkart, <span class="casemissing">92 Ga. App. 80</span>, 84, supra, wherein a wife failed to deliver a served petition to the defendant husband which resulted in the husband not filing defensive pleadings. The court held: "The defendant's grievance, if any, is properly not against the court which rendered the default judgment, but against the person, his wife, who brought about his misfortune by preventing him from filing what he conceives to be a good defense to the original suit." The defendant corporation's grievance in the instant case is with its agents and not with the court. The trial court erred in opening the default and allowing defensive pleadings to be filed.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where the case is in default, the plaintiff can not recover when the petition does not set out a cause of action. Royal Indem. Co. v. Pharr, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../695/70/index.html">94 Ga. App. 114</a></span> (93 S. E. 2d 784); Nix v. Luke, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../690/92/index.html">96 Ga. App. 123</a></span> (99 S. E. 2d 446). The defendant contends that the petition is not sufficient on six grounds as follows: (a) The alleged prosecution was not for a criminal-offense or under a valid warrant; (b) the petition does not show that the prosecution finally terminated in the plaintiff's favor; (c) no proper allegations of want of probable cause or malice are made; (d) the petition shows and claims no actual, general, special, or nominal damages; (e) the petition does not show that the defendant, Homes Stores, Inc., instigated or carried on the prosecution; (f) the petition showed on its face that any action for damage to character and reputation was barred by the statute of limitations.</div><div class="casepar">The grounds on which the motions attack the petition are in substance grounds of general demurrer. The question for consideration is whether any of these grounds point out fatal imperfection in the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Ground (a) was as stated, that the alleged prosecution was not for a criminal offense or under a valid warrant. It is true that to support an action for malicious prosecution there must be a valid warrant. Cary v. Highland Bakery, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 553</span> (179 S. E. 197); Pye v. Gillis, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 397</span> (71 S. E. 594). If the warrant is void the action will lie for false imprisonment. See Satilla Mfg. Co. v. Cason, <span class="casemissing">98 Ga. 14</span> (25 S. E. 909, 58 Am. St. Rep. 287). The plaintiff was arrested under an affidavit and warrant as shown in the foregoing statement of facts. Under the holdings of the Pye case, supra, the definiteness, certainty, and particularity of an indictment are not required of the affidavit and warrant but it is only necessary to name the offense in a general way. The affidavit and warrant were valid and sufficient to arrest the plaintiff for cheating and swindling by attempting to pass a bad check. See Davison-Paxon Co. v. Norton, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 77</span> (24 S.E.2d 723).</div><div class="casepar">Ground (b) that the prosecution was not shown to have terminated in the plaintiff's favor is without merit. The petition alleges that a hearing was held on April 19, 1957, in the city recorder's court where the charges were dismissed. We construe this as a final determination. Pickard v. Bridges, <span class="casemissing">7 Ga. App. 463</span> (67 S. E. 117); Garrett v. Foy &amp; Adams Co., <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 613 (2)</span> (94 S. E. 822). See also Sykes v. South Side Atlanta Bank, <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. App. 450</span> (186 S. E. 464); Josey v. Cochran, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 656</span> (72 S. E. 42).</div><div class="casepar">Ground (c) that no "proper" allegation of want of probable cause or malice appears in the petition we think is determined adversely to the defendant by previous holdings of our courts. With this contention Darnell v. Shirley, <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 764 (2)</span> (122 S. E. 252) holds: "The 'malice' contemplated by law in an action for malicious prosecution is the same as in an action for malicious arrest, and 'may consist in personal spite or in a general disregard of the right consideration of mankind, directed by chance against the individual'." The Darnell case further holds (headnote 6) that "In determining whether or not there was a total want of probable cause for a criminal prosecution alleged to have been maliciously carried on the question is not whether the accused was actually guilty of the offense with which he was so charged, but the real question is whether the prosecutor had reasonable cause so to believe,--that is, whether the circumstances at the time of the prosecution were such as to create in the mind of the prosecutor a reasonable belief that there was probable cause for the prosecution. Hartshorne v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 239</span> (30 S. E. 666)." The petition shows that the plaintiff presented a check drawn by a third party to be cashed to pay for goods intended to be purchased. The defendant's manager could have refused to honor the check, but this he did not do. The petition alleges that the manager procured a warrant for the arrest of the plaintiff. Under the allegations of the petition, there was a lack of probable cause. To hold otherwise would subject any citizen who tendered a check to be cashed to summary arrest and detention. The alleged acts of the manager were in general disregard of the right consideration of mankind, directed by chance against the individual. Code  105-1002; Darnell v. Shirley, <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 764</span>, supra. See Auld v. Colonial Stores, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. App. 329</span> (45 S. E. 2d 827). While it may well be true that other facts may have been shown to establish probable cause, these facts are matters of defense and are not before us on the question of general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">Ground (d) that the petition claims no actual, general, special, or nominal damages is in conflict with the record. The petition alleged facts showing the plaintiff was entitled to general damages in a specific amount and prayed for a recovery of such damages. Moreover, if the allegations of the petition entitled the plaintiff to recover only nominal damages, the action would not be subject to dismissal. Young v. Western &amp; Atlantic R., <span class="casemissing">39 Ga. App. 761 (2)</span> (148 S.E. 414).</div><div class="casepar">The contention of ground (e) that the petition does not show the defendant instigated or carried on the prosecution is without merit. The petition shows that the plaintiff was arrested and prosecuted at the behest and under the directions of the defendant corporation's store manager. The duties of a manager obviously embrace all of the normal functions, and include all of the usual duties connected with the operation of the store. Under the holding of Conney v. Atlantic Greyhound Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../724/89/index.html">81 Ga. App. 324</a></span> (58 S. E. 2d 559) the petition may allege facts from which it may be inferred that a corporation's agent acted within the scope of his employment and the prosecution of his master's business. The petition in this case met the requirement. Similar cases are Great A. &amp; P. Tea Co. v. Dowling, <span class="casemissing">43 Ga App. 549</span>, 552 (159 S. E. 609); Hickman v. Paulk, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/15/index.html">96 Ga. App. 589 (2)</a></span> (100 S. E. 2d 634); Auld v. Colonial Stores, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. App. 329</span>, supra. The defendant's view is that the tortious act must be a part of the servant's employment. Customarily, employers do not engage persons to commit actionable torts. The servant commits a tort in the course of and arising out of his employment when the wrongful act is done in carrying on the normal functions of his employment. Harper was described as the defendant corporation's store manager. Included in the usual responsibilities of a store manager is to prevent fraud being perpetrated upon the store owner in connection with the business. When in the performance of this duty the manager causes the prosecution of another, his employer, the store owner is under the doctrine of respondeat superior legally liable for his conduct.</div><div class="casepar">Ground (f) asserts that the petition shows on its face that the action is barred. The arrest occurred according to the petition on March 29, 1957. The plaintiff's prosecution was alleged to have terminated on April 19, 1957. Code  105-806 provides that the cause of action does not accrue until the prosecution has terminated. See Kennemer v. Shahan, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 140</span> (148 S. E. 923). The statute began to run from such termination (April 19, 1957) and since the plaintiff lead two years to file his action (McCullough v. Atlantic Refining Co., <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 237</span>, 177 S. E. 601; Davison-Paxon Co. v. Norton, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 77</span>, supra), the petition is not banded by the statute of limitations.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. Felton, C.
