Where the plaintiff has designated his insurer as a "nominal defendant" in an action against an uninsured motorist brought under the provisions of the Uninsured Motorist Act (Ga. L. 1963, p. 588, as amended by Ga. L. 1964, p. 306), designated as Code  56-407A, and found in Code Ann.  56-407.1, the insurer is entitled to challenge by demurrer its status as a defendant.</div><div class="casepar">2. The provisions of the Uninsured Motorist Act (Ga. L. 1963, p. 588, as amended by Ga. L. 1964, p. 306; Code  56-407A; Code Ann.  56-407.1) neither contemplate nor authorize the naming of the plaintiff's insurer as a defendant, nominal or otherwise, in an action brought against a known or an unknown uninsured motorist. If it is named as a defendant, plaintiff's insurer is entitled to have the petition recast, striking therefrom its name as a defendant and all reference to the matter of insurance.</div><div class="casepar">3. The insurer is entitled to intervene in an action brought by an insured against an uninsured motorist for the purpose, inter alia, of contesting the jurisdiction of the court or the matter of liability on the part of the defendant, or both.</div><div class="casepar">Brown brought suit against Blakely, "as defendant," and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, "as nominal defendant," for damages arising out of an automobile collision allegedly attributable to the negligence of Blakely.</div><div class="casepar">In the petition as amended State Farm was named "as nominal defendant" under Code  56-407A (Code Ann.  56-407.1), and it was alleged that State Farm had an agent in Catoosa County "upon whom service of process can be perfected; therefore, said nominal defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of this court."</div><div class="casepar">The petition as amended further alleged: "That the defendant, David Charles Blakely, owner and operator of the vehicle causing injury and damage to the plaintiff, was not covered by a policy of property damage or bodily injury liability insurance; therefore, same was an 'uninsured motor vehicle.' That the nominal defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to the plaintiff, which insurance policy provides for coverage to him for damage caused by an uninsured motorist, and said policy was in full force and effect at all times herein mentioned. Said insurance company is named herein as a nominal defendant in order that a copy of the petition and process can be served upon it, as prescribed by law, as though said insurance company was a party defendant."</div><div class="casepar">State Farm, as "one of the defendants in the above-stated case," filed a general demurrer, an answer, and a motion to purge the petition of prejudicial matter by striking its name as a party defendant. It also filed an application for leave to intervene, alleging that the application was filed before any party was in default and that it was necessary that it be allowed to file defensive pleadings as an intervenor, as distinguished from a defendant, in order to protect its rights. Defendant Blakely also filed an answer.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff filed motions to dismiss the demurrer and the answer of "the nominal defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company," upon the grounds that the nominal defendant was not a real party to the action and that there was no provision of law authorizing the filing of a demurrer and answer by the "nominal defendant." Plaintiff also moved to dismiss the application for leave to intervene upon similar grounds.</div><div class="casepar">The lower court denied plaintiff's motions to dismiss the general demurrer, answer, and application for leave to intervene. It also overruled the general demurrer and denied the motion to purge filed by State Farm "as one of the defendants." The application for leave to intervene was allowed, the order reciting that State Farm was permitted to plead and to protect all of its rights in the litigation.</div><div class="casepar">State Farm appealed from the orders overruling its general demurrer and denying its motion to purge; in the cross appeal plaintiff assigns as error the order allowing the application for leave to intervene and the orders denying its motions to dismiss the general demurrer, answer and application for leave to intervene.</div><div class="casepar">1. We are met at the outset with the contention that State Farm, in its designated capacity as "nominal defendant," was not authorized to file a demurrer to the petition for damages. As an abstract proposition we would think that a "nominal defendant" would have the right at least to challenge the authority of the plaintiff to so name it, whether the challenge came by way of demurrer or motion. The particular circumstances of this case affirm that right. The granting of the motion to purge would have the effect of eliminating State Farm as a party defendant as would also the sustaining of the general demurrer. Although a motion was made to dismiss the demurrer, we do not find in the record any challenge to the authority of State Farm to file the motion to purge. Be that as it may, however, we do not think the plaintiff is in a position to complain of the defensive matter filed by State Farm. The petition prays in Subparagraph (a) that "process do issue requiring said defendants to be and appear at the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia, within the time required by law, to answer this complaint." Although Subparagraph (b) of the prayer was amended so as to seek a money judgment only against "defendant, David Charles Blakely" rather than against " defendants," Subparagraph (a) was not similarly amended. It thus appears that State Farm has duly complied with process issued pursuant to the prayer of plaintiff's petition. We hold that State Farm can challenge the authority of plaintiff to name it as a "nominal defendant" and that there was no error in denying the motion to dismiss its general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">State Farm contends that this statute does not authorize the insurance company to be named and served as a "nominal defendant" in a damage suit against the known uninsured motorist. We agree. The statute provides that "a copy of service shall be made upon the insurance company . . . as though such insurance company were a party defendant." (Emphasis supplied). The use of the words "as though" precludes the naming of the insurance company as a party defendant and the consequent issuance of process against it. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> O'Brien v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 251 FSupp. 318 (E.D.Pa.). This prohibition extends to naming the company as a "nominal" defendant for purposes of service of a copy of the petition and process. As stated in McDaniel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 205 Va. 815, 821 (<span class="casemissing">139 SE2d 806</span>), which held that the insured plaintiff need not set forth, in his motion for judgment <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> against the uninsured motorist, the grounds for service on the insurance company: "[We stated in Doe v. Brown, 203 Va. 508 (<span class="casemissing">125 SE2d 159</span>) that the allegation in regard to uninsured motorist coverage] merely notifies the insurer that the action is instituted under the provisions of the uninsured motorist law and furnishes the clerk with the name of the insurance company in order that process might be directed to it; but we added that trial courts should not permit the motion for judgment to be seen by the jury or carried to their room where they might learn that the defendant was covered by insurance. Even in that case the plaintiff in the action could as well have furnished to the clerk the name of the insurance company to be served without stating it in the motion for judgment."</div><div class="casepar">The meaning of the use of the words "as though" in a statute is explained in In re Tompkins' Estate, (Mo.) 341 SW2d 866. In that case the court was considering a gift and inheritance tax statute which provided that " [w]henever any person . . . shall exercise the power of appointment derived from any disposition of property . . . such appointment when made shall be deemed a transfer taxable under the provisions of this law in the same manner as though the property to which said appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power and had been bequeathed or devised by the donor by will. . . ." (Emphasis supplied) . In construing this statute the court stated: "The words 'as though" are used to separate the first portion of the statute from the next two phrases, which as stated are intended as illustrative, and make reference ' as though' something were true which isn't. In Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged, the word 'as' is defined as: 'If.-- as if or as though. As might be, supposing or in case that); as anyone or anything would do if; as running as if (or as though) pursued by fiends; often implying that the supposition is unlikely to be realized . . .' The words, 'as if' or 'as though' are not used when referring to a matter that has happened, is known, is true or is realized."</div><div class="casepar">Related questions pertain to the method by which "a copy of service shall be made upon the insurance company." State Farm contends that the statute means "a copy of service" should be given the insurance company rather than a copy of the petition and process. In this regard it is contended that a copy of the sheriff's return should be made and given to the insurance company--that the statute contemplates merely the service of a notice by the plaintiff upon the company, giving the style and number of the case and stating that the sheriff's return showed that a certain case had been filed by a plaintiff who had insurance in a specified company. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Dictum in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Girtman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../77/index.html">113 Ga. App. 54</a></span>, 56 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../77/index.html">147 SE2d 364</a></span>) and State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Glover, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/26/index.html">113 Ga. App. 815</a></span>, 820 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/26/index.html">149 SE2d 852</a></span>) indicates that a copy of petition and process are to be served upon the company. In Girtman the statement is made: "[Code  56-407A. (d)] provides for service of process on such unknown owner or operator and for service upon the insurance company as though it were a party defendant . . . This same subsection further provides that where the owner of the vehicle causing the damages or injury is known, service shall be made on the insurance company issuing the policy 'as though such insurance company were a party defendant.' " In Glover we said: "[The uninsured motorists law] provides that a copy of petition and process be served upon the injured party's insurance company in case of an action against a known uninsured motorist."</div><div class="casepar">We think the dictum is correct. The statute provides that the service shall he made "as prescribed by law as though such insurance company were a party defendant." This provision means that service shall be made on the company in the manner prescribed by law for service upon other parties defendant, though it is not to be named as a defendant or referred to in the petition. Thus, the statute requires that a copy of the petition and process be served upon the company (see Code Ann.  81-202; Creteau v. Phoenix Assur. Co., 202 Va. 641 (<span class="casemissing">119 SE2d 336</span>); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Duncan, 203 Va. 440 (<span class="casemissing">125 SE2d 154</span>); McDaniel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 205 Va. 815, supra), but, as we have indicated, not as a party defendant against whom process had issued. In order to adopt the construction urged by State Farm we would be forced to disregard the quoted phrase. In addition, that construction of the provision would require an act of little useful purpose since a copy of the sheriff's return showing the style and number of the case would convey little information to the company. By service of a copy of the petition and process, however, the company would be put on notice of the facts alleged as a basis of recovery and other information which it would need in order to determine its probable ultimate liability.</div><div class="casepar">But since the insurer is not to be named in the petition, and no reference to the matter of insurance should be included therein, obviously there should be no return of service entered on the petition by the sheriff showing service on any insurance company. The only return of service necessary to be entered on the petition is as to that perfected on the uninsured motorist who is named as defendant. A separate return of service as to the insurance company, filed with the clerk, should suffice in complying with the statute.</div><div class="casepar">The orders overruling the general demurrer and denying the motion to purge were erroneous. Rodgers v. Styles, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../681/92/index.html">100 Ga. App. 124 (3) (110 SE2d 582)</a></span>. The questions as to the correctness of the ruling denying the motion to dismiss the answer of State Farm as a party defendant is rendered moot since we have held that State Farm could not properly be named as defendant.</div><div class="casepar">3. The remaining question is whether State Farm, as the carrier of uninsured motorist coverage, was properly allowed to intervene in the action against the known uninsured motorist who was not in default. We recently held that under the uninsured motorists law the plaintiff's insurer has the constitutional right to urge, inter alia, the non-liability of the uninsured motorist where the case is in default as to him and to contest the jurisdiction of the court. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Glover, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/26/index.html">113 Ga. App. 815</a></span>, supra. We are unable to distinguish this decision on the ground that there the case was in default as to the uninsured motorist, and we conclude that it must be followed. We stated in Glover that ". . . it would seem that the General Assembly intended that an insurance company in affording the protection to an insured would have a right to take whatever legal steps were necessary and fitting to see to it that the court trying the action against an uninsured motorist, first, had jurisdiction of the case and the person of the uninsured motorist, and second, to insure that the judgment against the uninsured motorist was not in default, and to insure that the judgment was rendered on legal and sufficient evidence." (Emphasis supplied). The basic question involved in Glover was whether or not the insurance company could intervene in an action against a known uninsured motorist even though intervention or other defensive action in this situation was not expressly provided for by the uninsured motorists law. The holding to the affirmative rests upon the propositions that (1) "to show liability against an insurance company under a policy insuring against injury caused by an uninsured motorist it is only necessary to show the rendition of a judgment against the uninsured motorist," and (2) a construction of the uninsured motorists law denying the company the right to resist the rendition of this judgment "by intervention or some method with a less technical name" would render it unconstitutional as denying the company its right of due process.</div><div class="casepar">There was no error in denying the motion to dismiss the application for leave to intervene and in allowing the application.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed on the main appeal; affirmed on the cross appeal.

      If the insurance company is named and served with process as a "nominal defendant," however, we do not readily perceive why the company, if it chose to do so, could not defend in this capacity rather than as an intervenor. See Division 3 of this opinion in connection with the following statement from State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Glover, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/26/index.html">113 Ga. App. 815</a></span>, 820 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/26/index.html">149 SE2d 852</a></span>): "Assuming that the court had jurisdiction on the pleadings and the uninsured motorist had permitted the case to go in default, the insurance company should have the right to contest the liability of the uninsured motorist by whatever name the pleadings might be called, if it in fact was in possession of evidence sufficient to raise a jury question."
