Y., requested defendant to move from his home in that city to Atlanta, Georgia, to manage a car washing establishment owned by plaintiff and operated under the name of Kwik Car Wash at 1241 Lee Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia. Plaintiff offered to pay defendant's expenses of moving his family from New York City to Atlanta and other expenses involved in relocating, and to pay defendant a salary of $125 per week net after all taxes and deductions, plus one percent of the gross receipts of said car wash business, with defendant's employment to continue as long as plaintiff owned said business.</div><div class="casepar">"4. Defendant accepted plaintiff's offer and pursuant to the contract thereby created, moved to Atlanta on or about February 1, 1957, and after familiarizing himself with the operation of the business, commenced managing the Kwik Car Wash establishment on February 12, 1957.</div><div class="casepar">"5. Defendant operated said car washing establishment as manager, pursuant to the contract of employment, until May 2, 1957, when plaintiff told him not to come back to work, that his services were no longer needed.</div><div class="casepar">"6. Plaintiff paid defendant $125 per week, net after taxes, through Tuesday, April 30, 1957, but never paid defendant one percent of gross receipts, in accordance with the employment contract. Defendant says that the books of said business will show gross receipts averaging better than $1,000 per week for each and every week when defendant was managing the same, and thereafter to and including June 9, 1957, plaintiff is hereby notified and required to have and produce the books of account, journals, ledgers and other documentary evidence in his custody and control showing the gross receipts of Kwik Car Wash, 1241 Lee Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia, from February 1, 1957 to June 9, 1957, inclusive, on each and all trials that may be had or held in this case, to be used as material and pertinent evidence for the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">"7. Defendant says that plaintiff is indebted to him in the sum of $10 per week for one percent of the gross receipts of said business from February 1, 1957 to June 9, 1957, inclusive; or a total of $180.</div><div class="casepar">"8. Defendant shows that on June 10, 1957, he obtained employment with Center Chemical Company, Atlanta, Georgia, for compensation equal to that due him by plaintiff, and defendant makes no claim against plaintiff for any salary or percentage of gross receipts after June 9, 1957.</div><div class="casepar">"9. Defendant further shows that he obtained employment as aforesaid on June 10, 1957, and that plaintiff owes him five and one-half weeks' salary at the rate of $125 per week plus all taxes, for a total of $825, plaintiff being the owner of said business until and after June 10, 1957."</div><div class="casepar">The case proceeded to trial, which resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion for new trial, which was later amended by adding one special ground. The trial court denied the motion, and it is on this judgment that the case is here for review.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence shows substantially as follows: On cross-examination the defendant testified that he was employed by Kwik Car Wash (Atlanta Car Wash, Inc.) on February 12, 1957, and identified his signature on an employment agreement (Exhibit No. 1), his indorsement on a check (Exhibit No. 2) made payable to the defendant in the amount of $500, his indorsement on a check (Exhibit No. 3) made payable to cash in the amount of $500, and a bill representing moving charges from New York to Atlanta which the defendant claimed was paid out of funds received from the aforementioned checks. On direct examination the same witness testified that he was hired by the plaintiff in February, 1957, to come to Atlanta to manage the car wash for a certain salary, plus a percentage of the monthly gross and that the plaintiff was to pay his moving expenses and the expenses of a plane trip to Atlanta in January for the purpose of renting an apartment, and that the notations in the right-hand corner of one check and the notation "loan" on the other check were not on the checks when he received them.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff also identified the exhibits and further stated that Exhibits Nos. 2 and 3 represented a $1,000 loan to the defendant which had not been repaid; that Exhibit No. 4 represented a moving bill which had been paid by the defendant and that "the two checks, the dual controls and the lamps make a total of $1,189.46 which has not been repaid although demand had been made many times," and that the amounts evidenced by the exhibits 2 and 3 represented a direct loss to the plaintiff's personal account. On cross-examination the same witness testified that the defendant formerly worked for one of the plaintiff's companies in New York called General Auto Driving School, Inc.; that the employment contract was signed about a week after the defendant arrived in Atlanta; that the plaintiff had seen the defendant previously in New York and had asked him to move to Atlanta but that the plaintiff had not promised to pay the moving expenses to Atlanta; that the check was noted "loan $200 and moving expenses $300" for Kwik Car Wash business purposes; that the plaintiff took the money from General Auto School and "naturally I had to show where it came from."</div><div class="casepar">Mildred Crafton, wife of the defendant, testified that she and her husband and the plaintiff had discussed coming to Atlanta prior to the move and that the plaintiff had said he wanted them to be happy; that they would have a good life in Atlanta and he (the plaintiff) would take care of the expenses of moving and a plane trip when they went to see the apartment; that the plaintiff had made no demand on her husband about repaying the money spent, and that neither she nor her husband have ever received mail at their home address from the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. We have set out the evidence somewhat in detail. The plaintiff contends that the evidence demands a finding in his favor. It is true that where in a suit on account a plaintiff's evidence proves the case as laid and the defendant offers no proof of an issuable defense, it is not error for the trial judge to direct a verdict. See Troup Roofing Co. v. Dealers Supply Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../704/98/index.html">91 Ga. App. 880</a></span> (87 S. E. 2d 358). However, in the instant case the evidence shows a sufficient basis for the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant. The facts in the instant case are not such as are shown in Troup Roofing Co. v. Dealers Supply Co., supra. The general grounds are not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">2. The special ground assigns error because it is contended that the court erred in charging the jury as follows: "If you find for the plaintiff, the form of your verdict would be: We, the jury, find for the plaintiff so many dollars. You will find on this form a place where the verdict may be written. You could find, under these pleadings and under the evidence that has been adduced here, anything from nothing to $1,000." Counsel contends that this charge was erroneous because the defendant did not produce evidence that the loans made by the plaintiff to the defendant had been paid, and that the amounts of the alleged loans were not positively set out in the pleadings and thus counsel abandoned any right to setoff as provided by Code  81-307. We think that the answer and counter-claim set out with sufficient explicitness the amount of the basis of the defendant's claims. Moreover, had the charge of the court been erroneous, which we do not concede, such was harmless. See Cochran v. Anderson, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 427 (3)</span> (118 S. E. 450) wherein this court said: "The jury having adopted and believed the contentions of the defendant altogether, any error in the excerpt complained of was harmless."</div><div class="casepar">In view of the pleadings and the evidence, the court did not err in the charge made. The special ground is not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Townsend and Carlisle, JJ., concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">William Hall, Stewart &amp; Hall, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">Lee Evans, for plaintiff in error.</div></div><div class="casechrono">DECIDED JULY 16, 1958 -- REHEARING DENIED JULY 30, 1958.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr>
