There is sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury, and a directed verdict in favor of the defendant Davis or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not sustainable, under the record of this case.</div><div class="casepar">Nathan Kennedy brought suit for $20,000 against L. H. Davis, d/b/a Davis Truck Lines and Maynard Buffington based on the alleged tortious death of the plaintiff's minor son. The case came on for trial in the City Court of Macon and upon conclusion of the plaintiff's testimony, the defendant Buffington made a motion for nonsuit which the court granted and the case proceeded against the defendant Davis only.</div><div class="casepar">Upon conclusion of all the evidence in the case the defendant Davis made a motion for a directed verdict which the court denied, and the jury found $3,000 in favor of the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was made by the defendant Davis and it is on the denial of this motion that the case is before this court for review.</div><div class="casepar">The petition is substantially as follows: Paragraphs 1 and 2 allege jurisdiction. Paragraph 3 alleges damages in the amount of $20,000. Paragraph 4 alleges that on August 25, 1954, the petitioner's son, Hubert Kennedy, age 15, was riding on a soapbox racer being pulled by the defendant Buffington and Edward Bales by means of a towing stick which was held by Bales as he rode behind Buffington on his motorcycle; that they were traveling upgrade in a westerly direction on Gordon Street about 200 yards east of the city limits of Thomson, Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 5 alleges that at the same time and place an employee of the defendant Davis was driving a truck-trailer combination easterly on Gordon Street meeting Buffington who had previously been driving close to his right of the roadway and who noticed the truck approaching at a high and negligent rate of speed heading towards his side of the road; that Buffington swerved suddenly to his right causing the deceased to lose his grip on the towing stick and go near the center line; that the truck driver drove in such a manner that the left-hand front and side of the truck extended over the center line striking and killing the plaintiff's son.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 6 alleges that at the said time and place the truck driver was acting within the scope of his employment with the defendant Davis.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 7 alleges that the truck driver failed to keep a proper look-out so as to observe the plaintiff's son; failed to give any warning; failed to have the truck under control and failed to slow down or stop the truck to avoid striking the plaintiff's son.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 8 alleges that the plaintiff's son was 15 years of age at the time of his death, and his services were especially valuable because of the father-son relationship.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 9 as amended alleges that the negligence of the truck driver was the proximate cause of the death of the plaintiff's son and describes such negligence in the following particulars: In driving his truck at a greater speed than was reasonable and prudent under the conditions and actual and potential hazards then existing; in failing to keep a proper lookout so as to observe the plaintiff's son; in failing to have his truck under control so as to avoid injury to the plaintiff's son; in failing to slow down or stop his vehicle in order to avoid injury to the plaintiff's son; in driving his truck to the left of the center of the roadway; in failing to drive his truck as far to the right side of the traveled portion of the road as practicable, this in violation of Rule 16 of the Georgia Public Service Commission.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 10 alleges and describes the negligence of the defendant Buffington in certain particulars. Paragraph 11 alleges that the concurrent negligence of the truck driver and the motorcycle driver was the proximate cause of the death of the plaintiff's son.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff prayed for judgment against the defendants jointly in the sum of $20,000.</div><div class="casepar">By amendment the following was added to the petition and shows substantially: Amendment numbered 1. That at the time the plaintiff's son met his death the said truck driver failed to drive as far to the right side of the road as practicable and there was in effect a valid rule of the Georgia Public Service Commission as follows: "Every motor vehicle shall be driven as far to the right side of the traveled portion of the highway as practicable." Amendment numbered 2. As shown hereinbefore in paragraph 9 of the petition. Amendment numbered 3. That the deceased left no wife or child surviving him.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant Davis answered the petition substantially as follows: By admitting paragraphs 1 and 6 of the petition, denying paragraphs 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 and the allegations of each and every subparagraph thereof, neither admitting nor denying the allegations of paragraphs 2 and 8 for want of sufficient information, by admitting the allegations of paragraph 4 except for want of information that the plaintiff's son and Buffington were traveling "upgrade". The defendant answered further by alleging that the plaintiff's son's death was caused solely and wholly by the negligence and carelessness of the plaintiff's son in the following particulars: In voluntarily releasing the towing stick causing his vehicle to cross the center line of the highway into the path of the oncoming truck; in failing to steer his vehicle along his own right-hand side in violation of Georgia laws; in failing to keep a look-out; in steering his vehicle to the left side of the highway which was not free and clear of oncoming traffic in violation of Georgia laws; in failing to keep his vehicle under proper control and in operating his vehicle on the highway at night without lights.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence is substantially as follows: On cross-examination L. H. Davis, operator of the L. H. Davis Truck Lines, testified that he was the owner of the 1950 Ford F 800 model 2 1/2 ton trailer truck which was involved in an accident in McDuffie County on August 25, 1954; that the vehicle had single front wheels and four sets of dual wheels; that the truck was carrying a load of chicken crates, total weight load approximately 36,000 pounds.</div><div class="casepar">On cross-examination Maynard Buffington, age 20 at the time of the accident, testified that he was driving the motorcycle involved in the accident; that Edward Bales was riding on the back holding a stick five or six feet long towing a soap box derby racer constructed of four wheels on axles connected by a two-by-four with hand steering apparatus; that they were coming up the road from Thomson towards Clark Hill Dam in the middle of the right-hand lane at about 9:15 or 9:30 p.m.; that it was dark and his light was on; that as he was going up the incline he met the truck coming down and he got nearer to the right-hand edge of the road within 2 1/2 or 3 feet of the shoulder. On direct examination the same witness testified that he and Edward towed Hubert up the same road more than once; that the last time as they proceeded up the incline the witness saw the lights of the truck approaching on its proper side of the road, that he would say the truck was going 10 or 15 miles per hour; that the boys were in the center of their right-hand lane of traffic and when the witness saw the truck he said, "Hubert, yonder comes a truck -- let's ease over a little; get over a little"; that he heard Hubert say something -- "I don't remember exactly what"; that he eased over and straightened out and just as he passed the cab of the truck he felt the tension of the stick being released and he turned around and saw Hubert angling out towards the center of the highway at which time he may have screamed; that he went to pieces and drove his motorcycle about 75 yards and he and Edward went into the ditch. He testified further that his motorcycle light was on bright; that he did not have a dimmer on it.</div><div class="casepar">On cross-examination G. E. Barfield testified that he was the driver of the truck involved in the accident; that he was traveling in a northeasterly direction towards Thomson and as he went down a hill on Gordon Street he observed a light in the opposite lane approaching him; that he heard a scream and applied his brakes until the truck stopped; that he saw no obstruction at all; that he recognized that the approaching vehicle was a motorcycle but he did not see two people sitting on it nor did he see the soap-box derby racer behind it. He testified further on cross-examination that his truck and trailer were equipped with air brakes. On direct examination he said he was traveling about 25 to 33 miles per hour in process of changing gears from high side of third into low fourth, and top speed on high side of third is 30 miles per hour, the truck being equipped with a governor; that when he heard the scream the motorcycle had passed his cab and he immediately applied his brakes bringing his vehicle to a stop as soon as possible; that his brakes were in perfect condition; that he suffered shock and was unable to make any inspection of the accident immediately thereafter.</div><div class="casepar">Nathan Kennedy, the plaintiff here, testified that it was his 15-year-old son, Hubert, who was killed on the night of August 25, 1954, and that four or five days after the accident he examined skid marks and identified 22 feet of skid marks on the truck's side of the center line and about 43 feet beyond the point where they crossed the center line; that his son was in good health and rendered services to his father the loss of which he valued at $20,000 to his son's 21st birthday. On cross-examination the same witness testified that Hubert's racer had no lights or reflectors on it, and the only steering device was a metal rod, the main support a six-foot two-by-four.</div><div class="casepar">Walter Jones testified that Edward Bales notified him of the accident and he went to the scene immediately and saw the boy's body lying on the right side of the pavement to the left of the truck; that he later examined the truck and found evidence that the boy had been struck by the saddle tank and rear wheels and skid marks crossed the center line.</div><div class="casepar">Roy Jones, an automobile mechanic, testified that he is familiar with the type brakes on the truck involved in the accident and he observed the skid marks the following day and that he would say that the truck was traveling 50 to 55 miles per hour and the brakes were defective in that when they were applied they grabbed and pulled to the left causing the truck to go over the center line. On cross-examination the same witness testified the hill had a very slight grade of 2 or 3%; that he could not judge positively the truck's rate of speed from the skid marks.</div><div class="casepar">Sam Cuminings, a fellow-employee of the defendant Davis, testified that he relieved the shocked driver and continued the trip to Asheville, North Carolina, the night of the accident, traveling over steep mountainous roads and that he had no difficulty whatever with the brakes.</div><div class="casepar">Edward Bales testified that he helped Hubert build the racer and was towing him in the manner described by Maynard, the driver of the motorcycle; that he saw the truck approaching and heard Maynard tell Hubert he was going to ease over a little bit; that they were traveling about middle of the lane at 10 or 15 miles per hour; that as he saw the front end of the truck pass them he felt Hubert release the stick and he looked back and saw the front wheels of the racer cross the line; that he estimated the speed of the truck at 30 or 35 miles per hour; that Maynard screamed and went to pieces losing control of the motorcycle and they went into the ditch; that he got off and ran to Mr. Kennedy's house to tell him that Hubert was hurt. On cross-examination the same witness testified that he was positive the truck's front wheels were on its right side of the road.</div><div class="casepar"> Counsel for the defendant Davis submit that the sole proximate cause of the death of Hubert Kennedy was his release of the tow stick and that because of such negligence the father cannot recover for the death of his son. Counsel argue that the deceased failed to use the required care for his own safety and voluntarily put himself in a risky position. Without going into the many cases cited along this line, we feel that it is sufficient to say that usually all questions of negligence, whose negligence and what negligence are jury questions. The suit asked for the recovery of $20,000 damages. The jury returned a verdict for $3,000 which to our minds showed that they considered every phase of the case in favor of the defendant Davis. We have studied the evidence carefully, keeping in mind that the evidence must be construed most favorably to the party prevailing in the lower court (see Martin v. Hutchison, <span class="casemissing">26 Ga. App. 24 (2)</span>, 105 S. E. 313), and keeping in mind also that the conflicts must be resolved in favor of the verdict and judgment rendered by the trial court. See Western &amp; Atlantic R. v. Mathis, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 172</span> (10 S. E. 2d 457). We find nothing in the record to show affirmatively that the deceased voluntarily released his hold of the tow stick. Legally we can see no difference between releasing the stick voluntarily or involuntarily, under the record of this case. In any event every phase of the case is presumed to have been considered by the jury.</div><div class="casepar">Under the record as presented here, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant the motion of the defendant Davis for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
