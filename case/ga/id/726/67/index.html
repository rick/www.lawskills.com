The solicitor-general is not entitled to a fee of $5 for each separate offense charged in a bill of indictment, but is only entitled to a fee of $5 for each defendant named in the indictment, upon conviction or a plea of guilty of one or more offenses charged therein.</div><div class="casepar">W. T. Maddox, as solicitor-general, filed his petition in Floyd Superior Court for a declaratory judgment, naming D. G. Johnson, sheriff; Melvin Owens, clerk of the superior court; and George S. Reese, a justice of the peace, as defendants, and asking the court to declare the rights of the parties as to costs in a criminal case in which all parties had certain rights as to fees.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleged: A county policeman swore out a warrant before the defendant Reese, charging J. T. Brown with the offense of possessing and transporting illegal whisky. Pursuant to such warrant Brown was arrested and put in Floyd County jail, then released under a bond set by the sheriff without any committal trial or specific waiver thereof. Maddox, the solicitor-general, prepared a bill of indictment charging in three separate counts the offenses of possessing more than a quart of whisky in a dry county, possessing non-tax-paid whisky, and transporting whisky in a dry county, and this indictment was returned as true by the grand jury after hearing evidence from four witnesses subpoenaed by the clerk. The clerk entered and docketed the indictment and issued four subpoenas for witnesses to appear at the trial of the case, but the defendant came in before trial and entered his plea of guilty to all counts in the indictment and was fined $200, including the costs of the case, which he paid, and he was given a probation sentence. Each of said officers prepared his bill of costs in the case, which was approved by the judge of the superior court, who ordered payment out of the solvent funds. The petitioner refused to pay portions of such bills of cost, and filed the petition for a declaratory judgment, asking the court to rule on what costs were properly chargeable in said matter. The issues were tried before the judge of the superior court, who rendered a judgment upon the specific questions raised, and all parties to the proceeding, with the exception of the sheriff, entered their exceptions to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar">The questions presented for determination, and the judgment of the trial court thereon, are:</div><div class="casepar">(a) Is a justice of the peace entitled to claim from a solvent fine a fee for the examination of a witness in a criminal case where the only basis for such claim is the administering of the oath to the prosecutor at the time the warrant is issued?</div><div class="casepar">(b) Is a justice of the peace entitled to claim from a solvent fine a fee for the waiver of a committal hearing when there is no specific waiver of such hearing?</div><div class="casepar">The judge of the superior court held that the justice of the peace was not entitled to said fees in this case.</div><div class="casepar">(c, d) Is the clerk of the superior court entitled to a fee of 15 or 50 for subpoenaing witnesses before the grand jury and the petit jury?</div><div class="casepar">The order of the trial judge held that be was entitled to only 15 for each such subpoena.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Is the clerk of the superior court entitled to a fee of $3 for filing and docketing a bill of indictment in addition to his fee of $9 for his services in a criminal case?</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge ruled that the clerk was not entitled to the additional $3 fee.</div><div class="casepar">(f) Is the clerk of the superior court entitled to a fee of 75 for recording a probation sentence in addition to the fee of $9 for his services in a criminal case?</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge ruled that he was not entitled to the fee or 75 in addition to his fee of $9 for services in a criminal case.</div><div class="casepar">(g) Is the solicitor-general entitled to a fee of $5 for each separate offense charged in a bill of indictment, or only to a fee of $5 for each defendant named in the indictment?</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge held that the solicitor-general was not entitled to a fee of $5 for each separate offense charged in the indictment but was entitled only to a fee of $5 for each defendant named in the indictment.</div><div class="casepar">Taking examination of person charged with criminal offense 2.00 Making out commitment .75</div><div class="casepar">Waiving committal trial 1.00."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant in the case was arrested and carried to jail where the sheriff fixed his bond. He was not carried before the justice of the peace. There was no committal trial, no demand for a committal trial, nor was there any waiver of a committal trial. The only act performed by the justice of the peace was the preparation of the warrant and the administering of the oath to the prosecutor in the affidavit upon which the warrant issued. Under the facts of the case here presented, the justice of the peace was not entitled to a fee of 50 for the examination of a witness in a criminal case, as there was no trial and no witness examined upon a trial; nor was he entitled to a fee of $1 for waiving a committal trial, as there was no such waiver before said official. Under the facts he was entitled only to a fee of $2 for issuing the warrant, and the trial judge properly so ruled.</div><div class="casepar">2. The court erred in adjudging: (a) that the clerk of the superior court was entitled to a fee of only 15 for the issuance of subpoenas for witnesses to appear before a grand jury or a trial jury in a case where the defendant pleaded guilty and paid the fine imposed; (b) that such clerk was not entitled to a fee of $3 for services in entering and docketing a bill of indictment in a case where the defendant pleaded guilty and paid the fine imposed; and (c) in adjudging that such clerk was not entitled to a fee of 75 for his services in recording a probation sentence on the minutes of the court in a case where the defendant pleaded guilty and paid the fine imposed.</div><div class="casepar">The act of 1881 (Ga. L., 1880-1, pp. 87-89) provided:</div><div class="casepar">"In criminal cases--</div><div class="casepar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXIt is contended by the solicitor-general that, in addition to his fee of $5 for the indictment, he is entitled to a $5 fee for each offense charged in the indictment upon which there is a conviction or plea of guilty, under the last-quoted provision of this Code section. We do not think that the contention of the solicitor-general in this respect can be sustained. It will be observed that the Code section fixes the fee of the solicitor-general for "each person" prosecuted for a capital offense; for "each person" prosecuted to trial or a plea of guilty for any other felony, or for gambling; for "any person" indicted or prosecuted for assault with intent to murder, who is convicted or pleads guilty of assault and battery, or assault; for "each person" indicted or presented this means a fee of $5 for the indictment. The Code section then fixes the fee of the solicitor-general at $5 for "each person" prosecuted to trial or a plea of guilty for any offense not otherwise provided for therein. There are numerous misdemeanors listed in the Code which are not mentioned in this Code section, and this last provision of said Code section fixes the fee of the solicitor-general at $5 for each person prosecuted to trial or where there is a plea of guilty for such offense, that is, for any offense not otherwise provided for in said Code section. This means that the solicitor-general is entitled to a fee of $5 for each defendant in such an indictment who is prosecuted to trial or who pleads guilty; and it does not mean that he is entitled to a fee of $5 for each offense charged in the indictment where the defendant is convicted or pleads guilty to more than one offense in the indictment.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge properly ruled that the solicitor-general was not entitled to a fee of $5 for each separate offense charged in the indictment, but was only entitled to a fee of $5 for each defendant named in the indictment, upon conviction or a plea of guilty of one or more offenses charged therein.</div><div class="casepar">Pursuant to the act of the General Assembly, approved March 8, 1945 (Ga. L. 1945, p. 232, Code, Ann. Supp.,  24-3501), this case was considered and decided by the court as a whole.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in cases number 32803 and 32804; judgment reversed in case number 32799.
