(a) Interrogatories and answers, or depositions, which were filed with the clerk of the trial court but which were never tendered or introduced into evidence, did not become a part of the record of the trial, and, although transmitted with the record on appeal, are not properly a part of the record and cannot be considered.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Error must be shown by the record.

This rule applies to the refusal of a request to charge the presumption of Code  38-119 when a defendant has failed to appear and testify.</div><div class="casepar">3. It is not error to refuse a request to charge the presumption of Code  38-119 on the basis that the defendant failed to produce and use a witness when there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that there was such a witness.</div><div class="casepar">5. It is not error to refuse a request to charge when the substance thereof has been covered adequately by the general charge.</div><div class="casepar">6. Inadequacy of the verdict does not appear simply because the amount is smaller than the plaintiff sought to obtain; and where the jury is authorized to consider the matter of comparative negligence, a verdict for a small amount will not generally be disturbed on the ground of inadequacy.</div><div class="casepar">7. The general grounds of the motion for new trial are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Mary Ruth Maloy and her husband, Charles W. Maloy, brought suit against George Dixon in which Mrs. Maloy sought damages for personal injuries sustained when there was a collision between a car she was driving and a truck alleged to have been operated by Dixon, the husband seeking recovery of medical expense disbursed in behalf of his wife and for loss of consortium.</div><div class="casepar">It is alleged that the collision occurred on an expressway, that both vehicles were traveling in a southerly direction, and that as defendant's truck was changing lanes the right side of the truck struck the left side of Mrs. Maloy's car about the front doorpost and windshield, and that she was seriously injured because of defendant's negligent operation of his truck. Defendant answered, denying all allegations of the petition save those as to jurisdiction, and asserting that Mrs. Maloy's injuries resulted from her own negligence or from her failure to exercise ordinary care for her own safety, and that if defendant were negligent in any manner the negligence of Mrs. Maloy equaled or exceeded that of the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs served interrogatories on the defendant, and defendant served interrogatories on plaintiff, Mrs. Maloy. Each answered. Plaintiffs deposed defendant, "for the purpose of cross examination, for discovery, and for all purposes permitted by law." The interrogatories and answers and the deposition were filed with the clerk of the court, but none of them was ever introduced or tendered in evidence on the trial of the case.</div><div class="casepar">The case came on for trial before a jury and each of the plaintiffs testified, introduced medical testimony relative to Mrs. Maloy's injuries, and the amount of the medical expense incurred. At the conclusion of plaintiffs' evidence, they closed. Defendant then closed without introducing any evidence, whereupon plaintiffs moved to re-open the case for the purpose of allowing them to call the defendant for cross examination, but the court refused to do so.</div><div class="casepar">Verdicts in favor of each plaintiff were returned, and being dissatisfied with the amounts thereof they moved for a new trial. Their motion was denied, and they bring this appeal, enumerating error upon the overruling of the motion for new trial, as amended.</div><div class="casepar">1. Although the clerk of the trial court has included the interrogatories and answers and the deposition in the record transmitted to this court, these were never introduced into evidence, never became part of the transcript below and are not properly a part of the record here. Herring v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../649/87/index.html">113 Ga. App. 680 (1) (149 SE2d 370)</a></span>; Smith v. Zachry, <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 290 (1) (57 SE 513)</span>. They cannot be considered in ruling upon the enumerations of error. Smith v. Continental Cas. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../678/00/index.html">102 Ga. App. 559 (2) (116 SE2d 888)</a></span>; Howell v. Federated Mut. &amp;c. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../645/59/index.html">114 Ga. App. 321 (1) (151 SE2d 195)</a></span>; Jackson v. U. S. Fidel. &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/03/index.html">119 Ga. App. 111 (3) (166 SE2d 426)</a></span>. "The burden is on the party alleging error to show it affirmatively by the record." Shepherd v. Shepherd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../144/30/index.html">225 Ga. 455</a></span>, 457 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../144/30/index.html">169 SE2d 314</a></span>). As will hereafter appear, certain of the enumerations of error are dependent upon matter to be found only in the interrogatories and answers, in the deposition, or by assertions in appellants' brief. The brief cannot serve in the place of the record or the transcript for the purpose of demonstrating error or for supporting a claim of error. Airport Associates v. Audioptic Instructional Devices, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../610/89/index.html">125 Ga. App. 325 (2) (187 SE2d 567)</a></span>.

Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Columbus, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../620/70/index.html">122 Ga. App. 412 (2) (177 SE2d 204)</a></span>. And in this context "record" means the pleadings and those portions of the record or transcript which reflect what in fact transpired on the trial of the case. Extraneous matter, though erroneously included and sent up, cannot be considered.</div><div class="casepar">2. Error is enumerated on failure of the court to give in charge a request that when a party has evidence within his power or control by which he may rebut a claim against him and fails to produce that evidence, a presumption arises that the evidence would be unfavorable or harmful to the party failing to produce it. This principle is stated in Code  38-119.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The request was grounded on the failure of the defendant to testify. The Supreme Court and this court have held that when a defendant, who is under no duty to aid the plaintiff in making out his case,<span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> fails to testify the presumption of Code  38-119 is not appropriate or applicable against him.

App. 293 (1) (145 SE2d 47)</a></span>,<span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> The presumption, if any, which could have arisen from failure of the defendant to testify was only that the plaintiffs' claims were "well founded," and since the verdict was for the plaintiff, establishing the defendant's negligence, it could have added nothing. Thus, failure to give the requested charge was, even if error (which we do not decide), altogether harmless.</div><div class="casepar">Bateman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/73/index.html">224 Ga. 20 (1) (159 SE2d 387)</a></span>. Even if it were concluded that denial of the request to charge was error, appellants utterly fail to demonstrate harm. In fact, they cannot because, as we have pointed out, if they had been afforded the benefit of the presumption it would have gone only to the matter of liability of the defendant, which was resolved in their favor by the jury.</div><div class="casepar">Cases relied upon by appellants do not require a different result. Quoting in their brief from First National Bank v. Atlanta Rubber Co., <span class="casemissing">77 Ga. 781</span>, 786, they assert that "It is a well-settled rule, where a fact rests in the knowledge of a party, and he fails to make it appear so as to clear up the case, that the jury may infer against the party on that account," but they fail to complete the quotation, which continues, "but when the fact is concealed by a party when interrogated thereto, this of itself suggests fraud." In that case the party (bank) did testify by its cashier, who failed to give certain critical information that obviously lay within his knowledge and which the opposite party did not have. Moreover, the court was not dealing with a charge of or a failure to charge the presumption, but held that court was authorized to charge on the matter of fraudulent</div><div class="casepar">assignments. The question at issue here was not there involved.</div><div class="casepar">Stevenson v. State, <span class="casemissing">83 Ga. 575 (10 SE 234)</span> was a criminal case, and states a rule which, if it ever had validity, no longer obtains. Mills v. State, <span class="casemissing">133 Ga. 155 (5) (65 SE 368)</span>; Clay v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../621/89/index.html">122 Ga. App. 677 (1) (178 SE2d 331)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Brothers v. Horne, <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 617 (79 SE 468)</span> dealt with the failure of a party to produce a witness at the trial not with his own failure to testify. (We deal with that in Division 3).</div><div class="casepar">In Moye v. Reddick, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. App. 649 (93 SE 256)</span>, the verdict was for the defendant not the plaintiffs, as here. Consequently, as against the plaintiff, the rule of harmless error had no applicability, as it does here. The same is true in Shiver &amp; Barnett v. Firemens Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 57 (2 SE2d 760)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">We think, too, that the observation of Justice Simmons in Western &amp; A. R. Co. v. Morrison, <span class="casemissing">102 Ga. 319</span>, 342 (<span class="casemissing">29 SE 104</span>, 40 LRA 84, 66 ASR 173), is pertinent: "It did not appear that this party had any better knowledge of the facts in issue than did the witnesses upon whose testimony he chose to rely, nor that he had an exclusive knowledge of facts he desired to conceal. Therefore, [in Thompson v. Davitte] this court held that the trial judge properly refused to charge as requested." (Emphasis supplied.) Nothing in this record indicates that Mr. Dixon had any better knowledge or any exclusive knowledge as to how the collision in question may have occurred. To the contrary it is alleged that he was driving the truck in the same direction that plaintiff was traveling, that the truck had passed or was passing plaintiff's car, and that in changing lanes the truck body struck plaintiff's car about the left doorpost and windshield. Mrs. Maloy testified that it was the dump body (which is behind the cab) that struck her car. That places Mr. Dixon behind the wheel on the left side of the truck and charges that the right side of the truck body, to his rear, struck the left side of plaintiff's car which plaintiff was driving at the time.<span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> If this account of the matter is correct, the truck body struck plaintiff's car at a point right in front of her, and she was in position to have seen all that happened, and how it happened, while the defendant was not. Mrs. Maloy testified that the truck was a dump truck, a big 1 1/2 ton truck, with a metal body. She remembered very little of the matter, had not seen the truck on the median, and in fact "did not see the truck" at all, but she also testified that "the front part of the truck was in front of me, not the back part." She testified that she was traveling at between 50 and 60 miles per hour, and had not changed lanes, but that the truck did.</div><div class="casepar">In Wood v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 256 (4) (88 SE 980)</span> the court simply held that evidence was admissible to show that a party, now deceased, had heard certain testimony on a former trial of the case and had failed to refute or to deny it, although he was in position to have peculiar knowledge concerning the matter. No charge or failure to charge was in question. And it was held in Cotton States Fertilizer Co. v. Childs, <span class="casemissing">179 Ga. 23</span>, supra, that it was error to refuse a request to give the principle in charge in a case where a creditor sought to set aside a conveyance from a husband to his wife, charging that it had been fraudulent and without consideration, the wife not appearing to testify concerning the consideration which she may have paid for the land. The court pointed out that in the circumstances of that case "the onus is on the husband and wife to show that the transaction was fair" under Code  3011 (now  53-505). In the case sub judice there was no burden on the defendant to show that he was not negligent; the burden was on the plaintiff to show negligence in making out her case. The court dealt with the matter of evidence, and not with a charge or failure to charge, in Johnson v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../163/13/index.html">218 Ga. 28 (126 SE2d 229)</a></span>, where a strong case of adultery was made against a wife by circumstantial evidence, which she made no effort to explain though she was made competent to do so by Code Ann.  38-1(306. It was held that the fact of adultery was thus sufficiently established. But in a similar situation it was held erroneous to charge the principle of  38-119 to the jury. Cocroft v. Cocroft, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 714 (5) (124 SE 346)</span>. In Mitchell v. Hayden Stone, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/23/index.html">225 Ga. 711 (171 SE2d 280)</a></span> the defendant was charged with a fraudulent sale of plaintiff's property, and that he had secreted the proceeds, the whereabouts of which was peculiarly within his knowledge and not that of the plaintiff. And again, the court dealt with the admissibility of evidence, not a charge or failure to charge the presumption.</div><div class="casepar">In none of the cases relied upon by appellants was the situation one where there had been a verdict for the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was seeking to set it aside, invoking a failure to charge or to honor a request to charge the principle of Code  38-119, and in none of them could the harmless error rule have been applied.</div><div class="casepar">3. Error is enumerated on the failure to give the requested charge because "the defendant failed and refused to call the witness Joseph McIntosh to testify."</div><div class="casepar">A close and careful reading of the transcript and all of the record properly before this court does not reveal that such a witness existed. He is neither mentioned nor referred to, by name or otherwise, in the pleadings or in the testimony or documentary evidence introduced upon the trial. There is not the slightest inference that there was such a witness. Consequently, this enumeration of error is wholly unfounded in the record and is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, even if there had been mention of this witness and it had appeared that he might be a witness for the defendant, there does not appear anywhere in the record a showing that he "was in any way under the power and control of the defendant [Dixon], or that as a witness, if he were accessible, he was not as much so to the plaintiffs," and in that situation it would have been "reversible error, as to [Dixon], to read the Code Section [38-119] to the jury." Brothers v. Horne, <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 617 (3)</span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Nor is there anything in the record properly before this court to indicate that the alleged witness Joseph McIntosh, "knew anything of the matters in issue, or that such [man was] at the time of the trial within the control or even in the employment of the defendant," and thus "where it does not appear that either party has suppressed evidence within his power to produce, it is error to charge the jury" the principle of Code  38-119. Central of Ga. R. Co. v. Bernstein, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 175 (5) (38 SE 394)</span>. "Where it does not appear that a party has held back evidence within his power to produce, the nonproduction of more full and definite evidence than he presents raises no presumption against him, and there should be no charge given to the jury on the subject of such presumption.

Co., <span class="casemissing">107 Ga. 500 (2) (33 SE 644)</span>. This enumeration is wholly lacking in merit.</div><div class="casepar">4. Error is enumerated on the refusal of the court to allow a re-opening of the case for the purpose of permitting plaintiffs to call the defendant for cross examination after plaintiffs and defendant had closed.</div><div class="casepar">This is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, who is in full charge of the conduct of the trial, as appellants concede they simply contend that the judge abused his discretion. We cannot so find. A plaintiff is permitted, at any time he may choose in the making out of his case, to call the opposite party for cross examination. Code Ann.  38-1801. He may take his deposition before trial, and use the deposition, or he may call the opposite party to the stand during the trial. "The party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon." The Fair v. Kohler Die &amp; Specialty Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25 (33 SC 410, 57 LE 716). "The pleader is a builder who has a right to go on and finish from any beginning whatever, provided he can show his original plan by what he has done and what he proposes to do, and provided he will confine himself to that plan, and provided the plan is one which, when fully executed, will result in a real edifice and not a mere castle in the air." Ellison v. Ga. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">87 Ga. 691</span>, 712 (<span class="casemissing">13 SE 809</span>).</div><div class="casepar">It is for plaintiff and his counsel to decide when he will close his case, and whether he will close it before he has called the opposite party for cross examination. But, having made that decision and announced it to the court he is bound by it and may be released from it only in the judge's discretion. The judge should exercise the discretion if and when it appears to him that it would be a manifest injustice to refuse it. However, it is not generally error to refuse a re-opening of the case after both parties have closed. Greer v. Caldwell, <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. 207</span> (58 AD 553); Beale v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">22 Ga. 431</span>; City of Macon v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. 761</span>; Ga. R. &amp; Bkg. Co. v. Churchill, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 12 (3) (38 SE 336)</span>; Harden v. Central of Ga. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 218 (94 SE 263)</span>; Ricker v. Brancale, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../649/01/index.html">113 Ga. App. 447 (2) (148 SE2d 468)</a></span>. In Bartell v. Del Cook Lumber Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/94/index.html">108 Ga. App. 592</a></span>, 602 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../662/94/index.html">133 SE2d 903</a></span>), we stated that "The truck driver could have been called as a witness for the plaintiffs during the presentation of their evidence in chief as a matter of right. The matter of whether or not he could be called upon to testify for the purposes of cross examination in rebuttal after both sides had rested, however, was within the sound discretion of the judge," and we then proceeded to hold that there had been no abuse of discretion in denying a reopening of the case for that purpose. That situation and the present one are so similar that we are constrained to hold no abuse to have occurred here either.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's counsel stated in oral argument on appeal that failure to call the defendant for cross examination before closing his case had been a deliberate trial tactic; he had been confident that the defendant would take the stand in making out his defense. When one employs a trial tactic which does not work he has simply gambled and lost. He is in no position to make a retrospective change unless the court, in its discretion, allows it in the interest of justice. Compare Starr v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../131/01/index.html">229 Ga. 181</a></span>, 183 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../131/01/index.html">190 SE2d 58</a></span>). One may not sit by while matters are placed in evidence or brought out in the presence of the jury that would entitle him to a mistrial; he must make his motion promptly or he has waived the error. Cady v. State, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 99</span>, 109 (<span class="casemissing">31 SE2d 38</span>); Head v. Pollard Lbr. Sales, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../711/37/index.html">88 Ga. App. 757 (2) (77 SE2d 827)</a></span>. If he accepts a juror, knowing that the juror is disqualified, the disqualification is waived. Brown v. Holland, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../135/76/index.html">228 Ga. 628 (2) (187 SE2d 246)</a></span>. If he allows the matter to go to verdict he cannot thereafter complain of misconduct on the part of some of the jurors of which he had knowledge. Josey v. State, <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 468 (96 SE 1041)</span>. He cannot allow the introduction of inadmissible evidence without timely and appropriate objection without waiving the error. Andrews v. State, <span class="casemissing">118 Ga. 1 (1) (43 SE 852)</span>. In short, one cannot, in the hope or expectation of obtaining a verdict in his own favor, follow a trial tactic which he may believe to be advantageous but which results in a waiver and, when a verdict is returned which he now seeks to overturn, enumerate the error as a ground for setting it aside. Cf. Scott v. State, <span class="casemissing">229 Ga. 535</span>, 541.</div><div class="casepar">5. Error is enumerated on the refusal of the court to give a requested charge that "where personal injuries exist, our law infers that pain and suffering will result from such injuries."</div><div class="casepar">It is not error to refuse a request to charge, or to fail to give it in the exact language thereof, when it is adequately covered in the general charge.

This, in our opinion adequately covered the substance of the request, and there was no error in refusing it.</div><div class="casepar">6. Appellants contend that they were entitled to a new trial because the amount of the verdict was grossly inadequate. The jury returned a verdict for Mrs. Maloy for $3,500, and separately a verdict for Mr. Maloy for $3,163.20.</div><div class="casepar">On appeal the evidence is to be construed to sustain, rather than to destroy, the verdict, for every presumption and inference is in its favor.

She testified that she was earning "about $750 per month," and that the doctor allowed her to return to work after "about eight weeks." Thus, without any consideration of comparative negligence, it appears that the jury awarded to her a sum sufficient to cover her loss of earnings and additionally $2,000 for pain and suffering. The amount of damages to be assessed for pain and suffering is governed by no standard save that of the enlightened conscience of the jurors. Trammell v. Atlanta Coach Co., <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 705 (2) (181 SE 315)</span>. This verdict has the approval of the trial judge, and absent a manifest abuse and miscarriage of justice it should not be disturbed by an appellate court on the ground of inadequacy. Brown v. Service Coach Lines, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. App. 437</span>, 447 (<span class="casemissing">31 SE2d 236</span>).</div><div class="casepar">The only proof concerning the loss of or damage to her clothing, glasses or diamond earring is found in the testimony of Mr. Maloy who, in answer to a question as to whether any medical expenses had been incurred for the treatment of Mrs. Maloy's injuries and whether he had made a list of them, stated that he had and among those listed were "loss of clothing, $50.00; glasses $32.00, [and] a diamond earring $48.00." Clearly these items are not "medical expenses" within the meaning of Code Ann.  38-706.1 (Ga. L. 1970, p. 225). He did not testify concerning the ownership of these items, nor did he offer any proof, other than the listing, as to their value.

Here the jury may very well have concluded that Mr. Maloy's estimates of some of the items of special damages concerning which he testified were excessive, and have reduced them to what they conceived to be an appropriate amount and added to that result an amount for his loss of consortium which, by happenstance, brought the verdict to an amount equivalent to the total of his estimates, and this even without the application of the comparative negligence doctrine.</div><div class="casepar">As we have already noted, the jury was authorized to apply the comparative negligence doctrine, and in doing so was authorized to reduce the recovery for items of special damage, as well as for loss of consortium, in an amount proportionate to the negligence of Mrs. Maloy, if they should find her to have been negligent.</div><div class="casepar">We cannot say that the verdict for Mr. Maloy did not include some amount for his loss of consortium, and the only measure for loss of consortium is, like that for pain and suffering, the enlightened conscience of the jurors.
