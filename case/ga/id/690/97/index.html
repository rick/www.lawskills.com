Counsel for the plaintiff entered a suit on behalf of Richard Hasty, a minor, by his father as next friend, Arthur Hasty (hereinafter called the plaintiff). A consent verdict for $500 was approved by the judge of the superior court and the judgment was written as follows: "The parties to the above case having waived a jury trial and agreed that the case may be tried immediately, out of proper order, by the court without a jury, and it appearing to the court that the parties have agreed between themselves for a consent verdict and judgment to be entered therein in favor of the plaintiff;</div><div class="casepar">"Now, therefore, after investigation by the undersigned in open court, including examination of the report of the plaintiff's physician which indicates that the injury alleged in the petition was of a minor nature and has completely healed and that the minor in whose behalf this suit is pending has no disability resulting therefrom, said proposed verdict and judgment of $500 is hereby approved as reasonable and to the best interest of all parties, and the same is hereby allowed to be taken.</div><div class="casepar">"Whereupon, it is ordered and adjudged that on count 1 of the petition the plaintiff do recover of the defendant $500, together with court costs incurred in said suit in the amount of $--------. It is ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff recover nothing on count 2 of the petition and that judgment on said count be and the same is hereby entered for defendant. It is further ordered that the sheriff of this county pay from the funds paid into court the sum of $250 to Hugh G. Head, Jr., and Frank Lawson, attorneys for the plaintiff, in the within case.</div><div class="casepar">"This 8 day of March, 1957."</div><div class="casepar">On the same date the next friend executed an approved bond with surety as follows: "Whereas, verdict and judgment for sum of $500 less $250 as attorney's fee has been recovered in the above personal action, and</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, the prochein is desirous of receiving the proceeds of such judgment in the name and behalf of the said Richard Hasty, minor</div><div class="casepar">"Now, therefore: The said Arthur Hasty as such next friend, as principal, and H. E. Sanford Jr. as surety, hereby acknowledge themselves jointly and severally bound unto the Honorable Marvin Griffin Governor of the State of Georgia, and his successors in office, in the sum of $500 subject to the following conditions, to wit:</div><div class="casepar">"If the said next friend shall well and faithfully account of and concerning his trust, then this bond to be void; otherwise of full force and effect.</div><div class="casepar">Thereafter, counsel for the minor filed the following petition: "Hugh G. Head, Jr., as attorney at law for Richard Hasty, a minor, by his next friend and father, Arthur Hasty, in case A-57, 875 in Fulton Superior Court, brings this petition against Sheriff T. Ralph Grimes, as Sheriff of Fulton County, and respectfully shows to this court that: "1. Last Friday, March 8, 1957, Sheriff T. Ralph Grimes received a draft from defendant Colonial Stores, Inc., in said suit A-57, 875 in payment of a judgment entered in that cause in favor of plaintiff therein Richard Hasty, a minor, by his next friend and father, Arthur Hasty. Said sheriff accepted the draft conditionally upon its being paid, and it later was paid and the sheriff now acknowledges that he has the money, and has already given a disbursement of a portion of that money, but now refuses to pay the client's proceeds in the sum of $250 over to petitioner herein, Hugh G. Head, Jr., as attorney at law and attorney of record for said client.</div><div class="casepar">"2. On March 15, 1957, petitioner made demand upon said Sheriff of Fulton County for said money as provided in Code  24-206 and other provisions of law, but said sheriff continues to refuse to pay same.</div><div class="casepar">"Wherefore, petitioner prays for a rule nisi directed to said officer, the Sheriff of Fulton County, requiring him to show cause why he should not be required to pay said money or be attached for contempt." This petition was duly served on Fulton County Sheriff Grimes, who filed a response reading as follows: "1. In answer to paragraph 1 the respondent admits that he received a draft from Colonial Stores, Inc., in the above case and retained same until said draft was collected. Pursuant to order of court he has disbursed to the attorney, the sum of $250. He stands ready to pay to the next friend, Arthur Hasty, the remainder of the recovery in said case and has offered to deliver to Hugh G. Head, Jr., a check in favor of the said Arthur Hasty as next friend and to allow the said Hugh G. Head, Jr., to sign the sheriff's docket in receipt for said check.</div><div class="casepar">"2. The respondent shows that he has offered, and stands ready and willing to pay the sum which he holds, to the next friend if the next friend will present himself to the sheriff's office and sign the docket. Respondent has also offered to deliver to Hugh G. Head, Jr., the attorney, a check payable to Arthur Hasty as next friend, and to allow the said Hugh G. Head, Jr., as attorney to sign the docket in receipt of said check. The attorney has refused both of said offers and has demanded that this respondent deliver the money to the attorney personally.</div><div class="casepar">"3. Respondent shows he has no authority under law to pay the money of a minor other than to the bonded next friend, unless this court, which has jurisdiction over the property of minors where same are before this court, shall direct the respondent to pay same to Hugh G. Head, Jr., or to any other person.</div><div class="casepar">"4. Further answering, the respondent shows that he stands ready and willing to pay the sum of $250 which he holds, to any person to whom he may be directed by this court to pay same and further is willing to pay same to the next friend, Arthur Hasty without any further order of court if the petitioner herein, Hugh G. Head, Jr., will permit same.</div><div class="casepar">"Wherefore, having fully answered, respondent prays instruction of the court and that he be dismissed hence."</div><div class="casepar">The superior court passed the following order: "The within rule coming on to be heard upon consideration thereof and of the response and the pleadings and orders entered in the main case, it is ordered that the petition for rule absolute be denied, and the respondent is discharged.</div><div class="casepar">"This March 20, 1957."</div><div class="casepar">It is agreed by all parties concerned that the question before this court is one of law.</div><div class="casepar"> J. The sole question for this court to determine is whether or not the trial court erred in denying the rule absolute and discharging Sheriff Grimes. Counsel for the plaintiff call our attention to Code  24-206 and 9-606. Code  24-206 reads as follows: "If any sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, constable, clerk of the superior court, or attorney at law shall fail, upon application, to pay to the proper person or his attorney any money he may have in his hands, which he may have collected by virtue of his office, the party entitled thereto or his attorney may serve said officer with a written demand for the same; and if not then paid, for such neglect or refusal the said officer shall be compelled to pay at the rate of 20 percent per annum upon the sum he has in his hands, from the date of such demand, unless good cause is shown to the contrary." Code  9-606 reads: "Without special authority, attorneys cannot receive anything in discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash." Counsel call our attention to Patterson v. Childs, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 646 (1)</span> (72 S. E. 45) where it is held, " 'Payment of money due to the creditor or his authorized or general agent, or one whom the creditor accredits as agent though he may not be so, or to his partner interested with him in the money, shall be good; and if such agent receives property other than money as money, the creditor is bound thereby.' Civil Code (1910),  4311; McLaughlin v. Blount, <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. 168</span>; Holmes v. Langston, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 861 (6)</span> (36 S. E. 251). The rule is different as to attorneys at law; they cannot, without special authority, receive anything in discharge of the client's claim but the full amount in cash. Civil Code (1910),  4956." Counsel also cites John Bean Mfg. Co. v. Citizens Bank of Gainesville, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 615</span> (4 S. E. 2d 924). It will be noted from the Code sections and the appellate court decisions called to our attention by counsel for the plaintiff that those authorities have no bearing on the case at bar for the reason that no minor was involved in any authority cited. Where minors are involved the germane purpose of the proceeding is to protect the interest of the minor. In Nicholson v. Wilborn &amp; McWhorter, <span class="casemissing">13 Ga. 467</span>, it was held that an infant is not bound by the appearance of his attorney. He must appear by next friend or guardian. In that case the Supreme Court said: "Generally, an infant cannot appear by attorney, but must appear by a guardian ad litem, appointed for that purpose by the court, and the appointment of a guardian ad litem, is a power incident to all courts.</div><div class="casepar">"Where suit is instituted against Baron and Feme, the wife being an infant, she must appear by guardian in all cases, where she has a separate estate, or where, on any other account, her defence may be distinct from that of her husband.</div><div class="casepar">"A rule or order for the admission of a guardian ad litem, must usually be applied for by the minor, before pleading, and a copy of the order appointing him, ought to be annexed to the plea, or recited in it. But, if the minor has appeared by attorney, upon, at any time, ascertaining that the defendant is a minor, the plaintiff may move to strike out the appearance by attorney, and for the appointment of a guardian ad litem; and if the defendant fails, within a time limited by the court, to name a guardian, the plaintiff will be at liberty to name one; and he will, thereupon, be appointed. And similar proceedings may be had where the minor has failed to appear at all.</div><div class="casepar">"If an infant appear by attorney, it is error in fact, and a judgment entered against him on such appearance will be revoked upon writ of error, coram nobis." In Betts v. Hancock, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 63</span>, 65 (107 S. E. 377) this court said: "No part of the money received by the attorneys of record or by the prochein ami, and 'no property which is purchased with such consideration,' ever having been turned over to the minor, and no such money or property having been received by him and retained after reaching his majority, he is not estopped from pursuing his rights under the execution . . ."</div><div class="casepar">Payment by Sheriff Grimes to counsel would not protect the sheriff. It follows that if he is not protected in paying out the money, he cannot be compelled to make the payment of the money.</div><div class="casepar">TOWNSEND, J., concurring specially. I am not inclined to agree with the implication contained in this decision that where, in satisfaction of a judgment, the defendant has paid the full amount into court, and the sheriff receiving the money has paid it over to the authorized attorney of the minor plaintiff's next friend who has been bonded, such payment would not protect the defendant in a subsequent action by the minor on reaching majority and alleging that neither he nor his next friend had ever in fact received the money. I think that the defendant would be protected under such circumstances, and that the cases cited in the opinion are not authority for a contrary conclusion.</div><div class="casepar">Neither do I agree with the contention of the attorney in this money rule that the provisions of Code  9-606 as follows: "Without special authority, attorneys cannot receive anything in discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash" refer to matters transpiring in court. This Code section, according to judicial interpretation thereof, has always referred to transactions between the attorney for one party with the opposite party. The words "special authority" refer to authority granted the attorney by his client. I think that where the attorney is dealing with the court of which he is an officer, his authority to receive a check for money in the possession of the court and signed by another officer of the court should be presumed unless the contrary is shown. Accordingly, I do not think this Code section prevents the sheriff from insisting, if only as a matter of record, and for the protection of himself and his court, that his payments of court trust funds held by him be by check.</div><div class="casepar">But, to reach the heart of the case, the sheriff is liable to be ruled, if at all, under the provisions of Code  24-206 which provides for liability if he shall fail, on application, "to pay to the proper person or his attorney any money he may have in his hands." The sheriff has not refuted in this case to pay the money "to the proper person or his attorney." He has offered the case to the "party" (in this case the next bonded friend of the minor plaintiff) and he has offered the check to the attorney. The record therefore shows no such failure to pay as would subject the sheriff to rule.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Harold Sheats, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">Hugh G.
