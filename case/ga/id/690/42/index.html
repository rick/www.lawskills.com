D. Shirley filed a suit against W. B. Leedy &amp; Company, Inc., for money had and received.</div><div class="casepar">Count 1 of the petition alleged in part that: the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $3,562.50 plus interest at the rate of 7% per annum from November 19, 1956, by reason of the facts hereinafter set forth; on March 27, 1956, and at all times herein referred to the defendant, W. B. Leedy &amp; Company, Inc., was engaged in the business of procuring loan commitments and selling the same to builders for the purpose of financing the construction of new homes in the Atlanta area; on March 27, 1956, the defendant, acting through its agents, servants, and employees, sold and delivered to the plaintiff a loan commitment in the amount of $397,350 for the purpose aforesaid; at the time and in consideration for and in payment of the commitment, the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $3,973.50; the terms of the transaction between them provided and contemplated that the plaintiff would secure purchasers for homes that he was building and had for sale and that the defendant would procure loans on the homes upon application made to the defendant by the plaintiff in behalf of such purchases; the terms and provisions of the commitment provided that the defendant would repay the plaintiff an amount equivalent to 1% of the loan on each sale made by the plaintiff and for which a loan was provided by the defendant, thus giving the plaintiff an opportunity to recoup the $3,973.50 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff; on October 29, 1956, pursuant to the commitment, the defendant procured a loan on a sale made by the plaintiff to William Franklin Walker, Jr., on which transaction the defendant paid the plaintiff his 1%, amounting to $137; on November 9, 1956, pursuant to the commitment, the defendant procured a loan on a sale made by the plaintiff to Robert Fred Brown, on which transaction the defendant paid the plaintiff his 1%, amounting to $137; on November 19, 1956, pursuant to the commitment, the defendant procured a loan on a sale made by the plaintiff to Clifford H. Skipper and Jessie D. Skipper, on which transaction the defendant paid the plaintiff his 1%, amounting to $137; during August and September 1956, the plaintiff offered applications for loans pursuant to the commitment for Thomas Randolph Adderholt and Marvin Thomas Griffin and submitted to the defendant in connection with such applications credit reports on the applicants; notwithstanding the applicants were good credit risks, the defendant arbitrarily refused and declined to procure loans pursuant to the terms of the commitment, and announced to the plaintiff that the defendant was not going to accept any more loan commitments at all for the plaintiff pursuant to the commitment; the action and refusal on the defendant's part was arbitrary and unreasonable and in bad faith; and notwithstanding the defendant's failure to accept any more loan applications from the plaintiff, the defendant refused to refund the plaintiff the difference between the $411 which the defendant had paid the plaintiff pursuant to the commitment and the $3,973.50 which the plaintiff had paid the defendant for the commitment; the sum for which the plaintiff sues, $3,562.50, is the difference between $3,973.50 which the plaintiff paid the defendant and the $411 which the defendant paid back to the plaintiff; although the plaintiff has demanded that the defendant return to him the sum of $3,562.50, it has failed and refused and still fails and refuses to do so and is holding the money which it is not justly entitled to hold and which in equity and good conscience it is bound to refund to the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">Count 2 of the petition alleged in part that: on March 27, 1956, the defendant sold to the plaintiff what purported to be a loan commitment for the purposes aforesaid in the amount of $397,350, for which on said date the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $3,973.50; said purported commitment, according to its terms provided that it would expire automatically on March 10, 1956, if the defendant had not been notified that it had been accepted; on March 27, 1956, when the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $3,973.50 for the purported commitment, the commitment had not been accepted by the plaintiff on or prior to March 10, 1956, and the commitment had thus by its own terms already automatically expired at the time the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of $3,973.50 for it; under the facts and circumstances aforesaid, the defendant, on March 27, 1956, when it accepted the plaintiff's $3,973.50 did not bind itself to do anything, as the commitment had by its own terms already expired, and the plaintiff's promise to pay the defendant the sum of $3,973.50 was a nudum pactum, or naked promise, without any consideration moving to the plaintiff; since said date of March 27, 1956, and up to November 19, 1956, the defendant repaid to plaintiff $411 of the sum of $3,973.50, leaving a balance in defendant's hands of $3,562.50, which the defendant fails and refuses to pay the plaintiff; the retaining by defendant of the sum of $3,562.50 from the plaintiff and failing to pay him the sum, under the facts and circumstances aforesaid, constitutes bad faith on the defendant's part, and the holding and retaining of money which it is not justly entitled to hold and which in equity and good conscience it is bound to refund to the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed general and special demurrers to the petition, which were overruled.

Thurman</div><div class="casepar">Notary</div><div class="casepar">Notary Seal"</div><div class="casepar">As to the first count: It alleges no breach of the contract by the plaintiff in error. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of count one allege:</div><div class="casepar">"During August and September, 1956, plaintiff offered applications for loans pursuant to said commitment for Thomas Randolph Adderholt and Marvin Thomas Griffin and submitted to defendant in connection with such applications credit reports on said applicants. Notwithstanding said applicants were good credit risks, defendant arbitrarily refused and declined to procure loans pursuant to the terms of said commitment, and announced to plaintiff that defendant was not going to accept any more loan commitments at all for plaintiff pursuant to said commitment."</div><div class="casepar">As to count 2: Count 2 is based on the theory that the contract was null and void from its acceptance by the defendant in error and was not binding on either party because the offered contract provided that if it was not accepted by the defendant in error by March 10, 1956, the offer would expire automatically. Notwithstanding this provision the defendant in error accepted the contract in writing on March 27, 1956, paid the plaintiff in error $3,973.50, which it accepted, and both parties operated under the contract until November 19, 1956, 18 days after the expiration date of November 1, 1956. Under these circumstances when the plaintiff in error accepted the money on March 27, 1956, and both parties operated under the contract as aforesaid the defendant in error is estopped to say that the contract was not valid and binding for the reason that the acceptance after March 10th was a counter-offer which was accepted by the plaintiff in error. If such acceptance was not a counter-offer, the plaintiff in error is deemed to have waived by its acceptance the deadline for acceptance of the offer which it put in the offer for its own benefit. Furthermore such a provision in an offer is not a part of the completed contract at all and if with such a provision in an offer the offeror can still accept the acceptance of the offer. If A writes B a letter and offers to hire him for one month for $500 salary and provides in the letter that the offer expired on the last day of the month in which the letter was written, if B, two months after the last day for acceptance, accepts the offer in writing on the very letter containing the offer and begins work for A, it would be unthinkable to conclude that there was no binding contract between the parties. The second count is also otherwise defective in the same respects as the first count. See Estes Lumber Co. v. Palmyra Yellow Pine Co., <span class="casemissing">29 Ga. App. 15</span> (113 S. E. 821); Citizens Bank of Tifton v. Willis, <span class="casemissing">15 Ga. App. 772</span> (84 S. E. 157).</div><div class="casepar">An acceptance of an offer after the time limited is binding on the offeror if he assents to the acceptance after it is made. 12 Am. Jur. 548, Contracts,  57 and citations under note 1, Restatement of the Law, Contracts, Vol. 1, p. 79,  73.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special demurrer 2 attacked paragraph 6 of count 1 of the petition which provides: "The terms and provisions of said commitment provided that defendant would repay to plaintiff an amount equivalent to 1% of the loan on each sale that was made by plaintiff and for which a loan was provided by defendant, thus giving plaintiff an opportunity to recoup the $3,973.50 paid by defendant to plaintiff as aforesaid."</div><div class="casepar">The demurrer should have been sustained because the paragraph alleges that the contract provides that the plaintiff is to receive an amount equivalent to 1% of each loan procured by the plaintiff. This is in conflict with the contract which provides that the plaintiff is entitled to 1% of the amount approved by F.H.A. as builders loan.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special demurrer 3 reads as follows: "Defendant demurs to paragraph 12 of count 1 of the petition as amended and in particular to the allegation that the defendant's actions 'were done for the reason and purpose and with the effect of denying plaintiff any further loans pursuant to said commitment to place elsewhere and at the same time retain the money which plaintiff had paid defendant for said commitment' upon the ground that said allegation is a conclusion of the pleader without any pleaded facts in said paragraph or elsewhere in the petition to support said conclusion."</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge erred in overruling this special demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special demurrers 10, 11, and 12 to the second count of the petition are that the loan contract referred to in that count was not attached as an exhibit, and the count did not disclose whether it was a verbal or a written contract. From the allegations of the count it clearly appears that the contract was in writing. The contract did not constitute the cause of action or the basis upon which relief was prayed. Code  81-105. These demurrers were properly overruled.</div><div class="casepar">The remaining special demurrers filed by the defendant arc without merit.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">John L.
