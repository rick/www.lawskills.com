Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Alverson. November 15, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">NICHOLS, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Mrs. Estelle Wade filed a petition in the Court of Ordinary of Fulton County in which she sought, for herself and her minor child, a year's support from the estate of her deceased husband. After the appraisers made their return the applicant filed an amendment to the original petition in which she alleged that proceeds from certain insurance policies were not taken into consideration when the original petition was filed, and that the appraisers did not know of such policies, and requested that the appraisers be authorized to reconsider the appraisal in view of such information for the purpose of allowing so much of the proceeds of the insurance policies as a part of the year's support as they should see fit to do. The appraisers were ordered to so reconsider, and thereafter filed an amended return in which the proceeds of such policies were added as a part of the year's support. Thereafter, a caveat was filed to the return of the appraisers by Standish Thompson, who is Tax Commissioner of Fulton County, in which, as finally amended, it was alleged that the estate of the petitioner's deceased husband was indebted to the State, Fulton County, and the City of Atlanta for ad valorem taxes for the year 1957, that the property set aside in the return of the appraisers was excessive, and prayed that the year's support award be made subject to the payment of all taxes due the City of Atlanta, Fulton County, and the State of Georgia. The caveator also filed a motion to strike the amendment to the return of the appraisers which motion was sustained on appeal to the superior court. The ordinary entered a final judgment allowing the return of the appraisers subject to the taxes due the City of Atlanta and Fulton County. The widow, having filed a demurrer to the caveat, which demurrer was renewed after amendment and overruled by the ordinary, appealed to the superior court where such demurrer was overruled. It is to this judgment adverse to her that the widow excepts, as well as to the other judgments adverse to her.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The first question is whether a tax commissioner is a proper party to file a caveat to the return of appraisers appointed by an ordinary, although it has apparently been done in other cases. See Davis v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 242</span> (185 S. E. 279). Code  113-1005 provides that citation issued by the ordinary shall be to "all persons concerned," and in order to determine whether a tax commissioner is a "person concerned" it is necessary to look at the construction put On such term by the courts.</div><div class="casepar">In the case of McGahee v. McGahee, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 91</span>, 96 (48 S. E. 2d 675), it was said: "This court held in Jones v. Cooner, <span class="casemissing">137 Ga. 681</span> (74 S. E. 51), that 'only heirs, their privies, and creditors, may contest with a widow and minor children their right to a year's support out of the estate of the deceased husband and father.' Such person must be actually 'concerned' in the legal administration of the assets of the estate. Mathews v. Rountree, <span class="casemissing">123 Ga. 327</span> (51 S. E. 423)." "Taxes are burdens which the State imposes upon property owners in the exercise of its sovereign power. They are not debts as such. Not being debts, they can not be collected by a suit at law. State v. W. &amp; A. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">136 Ga. 619 (2)</span> (71 S. E. 1055); Citizens &amp; Southern Bank v. State, <span class="casemissing">151 Ga. 696</span>, 700 (108 S. E. 161); Cooley on Taxation (ed. 1924),  1330." Kirk v. Bray, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 814</span>, 817 (184 S. E. 733).</div><div class="casepar">It necessarily follows that if the taxes are not debts then neither the decedent nor his estate is a debtor as concerns such taxes, and that the tax commissioner is not a creditor who is concerned with the administration of the estate and who would be entitled to file a caveat to the return of the appraisers in the year's support proceedings.</div><div class="casepar">This question was not passed on in either Davis v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 242</span>, supra, or Paulk v. City of Ocilla, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 479</span> (190 S. E. 409), but what is above held is necessary if the policy of the law, as shown by Montgomery v. McCants, <span class="casemissing">49 Ga. App. 324</span>, 326 (175 S. E. 397) is to be carried out: "A year's support is a favorite of the law [citing], and it is the policy of the law to provide an immediate and effectual means of support of the widow and children for such time, 'and the courts should in all proper ways forward and carry out this policy.' [citing] 'The provision for a year's support out of the estate of a decedent is an anomaly dictated solely by a very humanitarian public policy, and in its administration this public policy should not be overlooked or disregarded. in any instance .' [Citing]. Its provisions are highly beneficial. The courts, in passing upon cases involving the rights of the beneficiaries under such statutes, should keep in mind the beneficial and benevolent purposes of the law and should jealously protect rights accruing thereunder. The ends to be obtained under the act are not to be encumbered with technicalities; and provisions contained therein which, if liberally construed, might seriously impede the purposes of the act should be strictly construed. [Citing] Our Supreme Court, guided by these considerations, held, in Jones v. Cooner, <span class="casemissing">137 Ga. 681</span> (74 S. E. 51), that 'only heirs, their privies, and creditors may contest With a widow and minor children their right to a year's support out of the estate of the deceased husband and father.' Such person must be actually ' concerned ' in the legal administration of the assets of the estate."</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, in further response to the contention that a tax commissioner, in his capacity as tax collector, has an interest in the administration of an estate so as to be a proper party to file a caveat to the return of appraisers in a year's support proceedings, reference should be made to Code  89-903 which provides: "Powers of all public officers are defined by law, and all persons must take notice thereof. The public may not be estopped by the acts of any officer done in the exercise of a power not conferred." The duties, generally, of a tax collector are set forth in Code  92-4901 and none of them requires him to examine all the returns of appraisers awarding years' supports, to determine for himself whether any return is excessive, and if he deems any return excessive to file a caveat thereto on such ground. Subparagraph 12 of Code  92-4901, supra, does require tax collectors to: "Perform all other duties that the law requires, and which necessarily under the law appertain to his office." These duties to which reference is made are duties placed upon him by law, for custom cannot extend his duties ( Taylor v. State, <span class="casemissing">44 Ga. App. 387</span>, 394, 161 S. E. 793, and citations), and the public is bound to know his duties, whatever they are. Wood v. Puritan Chemical Co., <span class="casemissing">178 Ga. 229</span> (172 S. E. 557).</div><div class="casepar">As shown above, the law provides the method for collecting taxes, and there is no authority to collect taxes in any other manner than that so provided ( Kirk v. Bray, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 814</span>, supra), and while it is vigorously denied that the tax collector is attempting to collect taxes in the present action, it cannot be denied that his only concern is that he won't be able to collect the taxes which he contends are due if his contentions are true and his position is not sustained. Especially is this true since his caveat prays in part that: "Any award finally entered on this application (for year's support) be made subject to the payment of all taxes due Fulton County and the State of Georgia, and the City of Atlanta."</div><div class="casepar">If the governments purported to be represented by the tax commissioner in his capacity as tax collector have such an interest in the administration of an estate because of taxes which might be due them in the event the estate is sufficient to provide for those claims on the estate superior to their taxes and still have funds available for the taxes, then it would be the proper authorities of such governments who would be authorized to file a caveat to the year's support proceedings, and not the tax collector, whose duties are limited by law.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the general demurrer to the caveat as amended should have been sustained, for the tax commissioner was not a "person concerned" as contemplated by Code  113-1005.</div><div class="casepar">2. Since the caveat to the return of the appraisers was without standing in the proceedings in the courts below it necessarily follows that the other judgments adverse to the widow on motions of the caveator were error and must be reversed.</div><div class="casepar">The tax commissioner is charged with the collection of taxes and is impliedly authorized to do whatever is necessary and proper to insure their collection in his official capacity. Code  92-4901. See Code  113-1212. The fact that a year's support is a favorite of the law and dictated by a very humanitarian public policy is irrelevant to the issue. The law does not intend for an excessive. year's support to transfer the burden of taxes from the property set aside as a year's support to other innocent taxpayers. I dissent from the judgment of reversal.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Harold Sheats, Paul H. Anderson, W.
