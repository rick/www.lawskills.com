Cobb Superior Court. Before Judge Bodiford.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Appellants are establishments which provide adult entertainment and are located within the City of Marietta. For several years, each establishment has applied for and received annual licenses issued by the city authorizing the businesses to provide adult entertainment and to serve alcoholic beverages. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> In January 1995, acting pursuant to the authority granted by a 1994 amendment to the Georgia Constitution, the Marietta City Council passed an amendment to the city's adult entertainment ordinance which amendment provided that a liquor license would not be issued for a location at which was performed entertainment that required the issuance of an adult entertainment license. In effect, the amended adult entertainment ordinance banned alcohol in adult entertainment establishments by requiring an applicant to choose between obtaining a liquor license or obtaining a license to provide adult entertainment. The amended ordinance also provided that licenses previously granted would not be subject to the amendment until December 31, 1995, "at which time all licensees within the City of Marietta shall be subject to this provision, including those licensees licensed before the effective date hereof."</div><div class="casepar">Following passage of the 1995 amendment to the city's adult entertainment ordinance, each of the appellants filed a separate action against the city, its council members, and its mayor, seeking a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of certain provisions of Marietta's ordinances; injunctive relief against enforcement of the ordinances; and damages. Appellant Cyprus Lounge also sought a writ of mandamus requiring the city to issue to it adult entertainment and liquor licenses for 1996. The trial court consolidated the three cases and, after an extended hearing, granted summary judgment to the defendants and denied injunctive relief to the plaintiffs. Each of the businesses and the person to whom the adult entertainment and liquor licenses were issued appealed the trial court's judgment to this Court, and we have consolidated the three appeals. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. The 1995 Marietta ordinance amendment was enacted following the ratification of an amendment to the Georgia Constitution which is now embodied in Art. III, Sec. VI, Par. VII. The constitutional amendment gives the State of Georgia "full and complete authority to regulate alcoholic beverages and to regulate, restrict, or prohibit activities involving alcoholic beverages[,]" including the regulatory authority given the States by the Twenty-first Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. The constitutional amendment goes on to delegate this regulatory authority to the counties and municipalities of Georgia "for the purpose of regulating, restricting, or prohibiting the exhibition of nudity, partial nudity, or depictions of nudity in connection with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages. . . ." Before the trial court, as well as on appeal, appellant Boomer's contends that the constitutional amendment is a fatally overbroad unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.</div><div class="casepar">The constitutional amendment's authorization to the State to "regulate, restrict, or prohibit activities involving alcoholic beverages" and its delegation of regulatory authority to local governments to regulate, restrict, or prohibit nudity, partial nudity, or depictions of nudity, without regard to whether the activity limited or the nudity proscribed is constitutionally protected, run counter to the holdings in Harris v. Entertainment Systems, <span class="casemissing">259 Ga. 701 (386 SE2d 140) (1989)</span>, and Pel Asso, Inc. v. Joseph, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../353/7/index.html">262 Ga. 904 (427 SE2d 264) (1993)</a></span>. In those cases, this Court found a statute and an ordinance overbroad because one went beyond "prohibiting nude dancing in bars" and the other applied to mainstream performance houses and private conduct as well as barroom nude dancing. Despite the appearance of similar overbreadth in the 1994 constitutional amendment, we decline to brand the constitutional amendment as unconstitutionally overbroad because we perceive a fundamental distinction between it and the statute and ordinance which were found lacking in Harris and Pel Asso, Inc.: the constitutional amendment is not a self-executing amendment, but requires the passage of legislation to give it effect.</div><div class="casepar">"A constitutional provision may be said to be self-executing if it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be enjoyed and protected or the duty imposed may be enforced; and it is not self-executing when it merely indicates principles, without laying down rules by means of which those principles may be given the force of law."</div><div class="casepar">Davis v. Burke, 179 U. S. 399, 403 (21 SC 210, 45 LE 249) (1900), quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations. The constitutional amendment at issue here is not self-executing because it "merely indicates a line of policy or principle without supplying the means by which such policy or principle are to be carried into effect," and because "it appears from the language . . . that subsequent legislation was contemplated to carry it into effect." 16 CJS 123, 126, Constitutional Law,  46. The 1994 constitutional amendment "clearly anticipates" the enactment of legislation by the General Assembly or a local governing body to implement the principles set forth in the amendment. Cox v. French, 640 SW2d 786 (Ark. 1982). See J. W. A. v. State of Ga. , <span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/81/index.html">233 Ga. 683 (212 SE2d 849) (1975)</a></span>. Because implementation of the constitutional amendment requires legislative enactment, the constitutional amendment is not effective until the legislation is passed. State v. Pendergrass, 633 P2d 1113 (Hawaii 1981). See also DeKalb County v. Allstate Beer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../132/11/index.html">229 Ga. 483 (2) (192 SE2d 342) (1972)</a></span>. Consequently, while the wording of the constitutional amendment authorizes enactment of local legislation that would be condemned as overbroad, it is the language of the enacted local legislation, not the constitutional amendment, which must be examined for overbreadth. That being so, we decline to declare the constitutional amendment unconstitutionally overbroad.</div><div class="casepar">2. (a) Appellant Varsalona asserts that the 1994 constitutional amendment violates the Georgia constitutional provision prohibiting the presentation to voters of a proposed constitutional amendment containing more than one subject matter. 1983 Ga. Const., Art. X, Sec. I, Par. II.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Varsalona also contends that the wording of the ballot <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> concerning the constitutional amendment deceived the voters of Georgia, resulting in a violation of the due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">"[T]his court . . . [conducts] only a minimal review of ballot language if the state followed all of the constitutionally and statutorily required procedures for amending the constitution . . . ." Donaldson v. Dept. of Transp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/9/index.html">262 Ga. 49</a></span>, 51 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/9/index.html">414 SE2d 638</a></span>) (1992). There is no contention in the case at bar that the prescribed amendment procedure was not followed. "The only limitation on the General Assembly in drafting ballot language is that the language be adequate to enable the voters to ascertain which amendment they are voting on. [Cit.]" Id. See also Burton v. Georgia, 953 F2d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir. 1992) ("As long as citizens are afforded reasonable opportunity to examine the full text of the proposed amendment, . . . substantive due process requires no more than that the voter not be deceived [by the ballot language] about what amendment is at issue."). We conclude that the language used on the ballot is not susceptible to appellant's attack for it clearly enabled the voters to ascertain what amendment they were voting on.</div><div class="casepar">3. Since the constitutional amendment which authorized the passage of the 1995 amendment to Marietta's ordinance has withstood Boomer's constitutional attack, we next focus our attention on the analytical approach to be taken with regard to the amended ordinance in light of the passage of the constitutional amendment. In Harris v. Entertainment Systems, <span class="casemissing">259 Ga. 701 (1)</span> (b), supra, this Court concluded that the State's exercise of its police power, as far as nude dancing is concerned, was limited by Georgia's constitutional guaranty of free expression, and scrutinized the statute which impinged upon protected expression under the state constitution's free speech clause, Art. I, Sec. I, Par. V. See Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Busbee, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/2/index.html">250 Ga. 252 (297 SE2d 250) (1982)</a></span>. The court took that approach after conceding the possibility that passage of the Twenty-first Amendment to the federal constitution restored to the State police power otherwise limited by the First Amendment, but noting that the freedom of expression protected by the state constitution had not been similarly limited by ratification of a state constitutional amendment equivalent to the Twenty-first Amendment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Id. See also Chambers v. Peach County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../206/3/index.html">266 Ga. 318</a></span>, n. 2 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../206/3/index.html">467 SE2d 519</a></span>) (1996); Pel Asso, Inc. v. Joseph, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../353/7/index.html">262 Ga. 904</a></span>, 905, n. 1; Gravely v. Bacon, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/9/index.html">263 Ga. 203</a></span>, 208 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/9/index.html">429 SE2d 663</a></span>)(1993) (Hunt, P. J., concurring). But see Illusions on Peachtree Street v. Young, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/8/index.html">257 Ga. 142 (3) (356 SE2d 510) (1987)</a></span>, where this Court, faced with a First Amendment challenge to a city ordinance, relied on the broad power to regulate alcohol it said had been given local governments by the Twenty-first Amendment; and Jackson v. Three Aces Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../707/0/index.html">249 Ga. 395</a></span>, 396 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../707/0/index.html">291 SE2d 522</a></span>) (1982), where this Court stated that the Twenty-first Amendment vested state and local governments with "broad, sweeping authority to refuse to license the sale of liquor in establishments in which even non-obscene naked dancing is performed. [Cit.]"</div><div class="casepar">Believing the passage of the 1994 constitutional amendment to have provided the Georgia Constitution with its equivalent of the Twenty-first Amendment to the U. S. Constitution <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> and relying on U. S. Supreme Court case law, the trial court concluded that Marietta's amended ordinance should be analyzed under the principles of the Twenty-first Amendment rather than the First Amendment. Faced, however, with a dearth of Georgia case law examining a local ordinance enacted after the 1994 constitutional amendment, the trial court relied on pre-amendment case law and applied Georgia's free expression analysis, the Paramount Pictures test, to the amended ordinance. See Paramount Pictures v. Busbee, supra,<span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/2/index.html">250 Ga. 252</a></span>. We conclude that, under recent case law from the U. S. Supreme Court, the trial court was in error when it determined that passage of the 1994 constitutional amendment required analysis of the Marietta ordinance under the Twenty-first Amendment. However, as will be seen, the trial court's use of the applicable Paramount Pictures test rendered the error harmless.</div><div class="casepar">It is easy to see why the trial court believed that freedom of expression had been supplanted by the authority delegated to the States by the Twenty-first Amendment and by the authority delegated by the State of Georgia to local governments in the 1994 constitutional amendment. In California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 118 (93 SC 390, 34 LE2d 342) (1972), the U. S. Supreme Court concluded an opinion in which it held that California's regulations prohibiting certain sexual performances and the dispensation of liquor were not violative of the First Amendment by stating that, "[g]iven the added presumption in favor of the validity of the state regulation in this area that the Twenty-first Amendment requires," it could not hold the state regulations facially invalid under the U. S. Constitution. In Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U. S. 922, 932-933 (95 SC 2561, 45 LE2d 648) (1975), the court, summarizing its LaRue construction of the Twenty-first Amendment, stated that "the broad powers of the States to regulate the sale of liquor, conferred by the Twenty-first Amendment, outweighed any First Amendment interest in nude dancing and that a State could therefore ban such dancing as a part of its liquor license program." See also City of Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92, 95 (107 SC 383, 93 LE2d 334) (1986). In NY State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714, 717 (101 SC 2599, 69 LE2d 357) (1981), the court held that the State's power under the Twenty-first Amendment to ban the sale of alcohol entirely "includes the lesser power to ban the sale of liquor on premises where topless dancing occurs. Although the U. S. Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights (Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (97 SC 451, 50 LE2d 397) (1976)) or override any other relevant constitutional provision (California v. LaRue, supra, 409 U. S. at 120 (Stewart, J., concurring)), the court's statements in LaRue, Doran, Bellanca, and Iacobucci became the basis for rulings by state appellate courts which upheld a statute or ordinance banning non-obscene nude dancing in a location with a liquor license. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> See State v. Larson, 653 S2d 1158 (La. 1995); Proctor v. County of Penobscot, 651 A2d 355 (Me. 1994); City of Billings v. Laedeke, 805 P2d 1348 (Mont. 1991); Misleh v. State, 799 P2d 631 (Okla. Cr. App. 1990); State of Idaho v. Pierandozzi, 784 P2d 331 (Idaho 1989); Morris v. Municipal Court, 652 P2d 51 (Cal. 1982); Nall v. Baca, 626 P2d 1280 (N.M. 1980); Barmat v. Robertson, 611 P2d 101 (Ariz. App. 1980). As was noted earlier, this Court also saw the power of the Twenty-first Amendment as a means by which expression might be controlled. See Illusions, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/8/index.html">257 Ga. 142</a></span>; Three Aces Co., supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../707/0/index.html">249 Ga. 395</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">This long-used rationale has been called into question by the Supreme Court's recent disavowal of the reasoning in LaRue "insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment." 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. ---- (116 SC 1495, 134 LE2d 711) (1996). In 44 Liquormart, the Supreme Court explained that the Twenty-first Amendment "limits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause on a State's regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages within its border, [but] . . . 'does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.' [Cit.]" Id., 116 SC at 1514. The court noted that each state has ample power "[e]ntirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment," i.e.,the police power, to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate locations, and that the LaRue decision would have reached the same result had the court relied exclusively on the State's exercise of its police power instead of buttressing it with the regulatory authority provided by the Twenty-first Amendment. In conclusion, the Supreme Court expressly held that "the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the First Amendment." Thus, "the suggestion in [LaRue, Doran, Bellanca, and Iacobucci] that the Twenty-first Amendment was a font of some sort of 'super authority' above and beyond the considerable police powers retained by the States and which trumped the First Amendment when liquor regulation was at issue was clearly rejected in 44 Liquormart." J &amp; B Social Club #1 v. City of Mobile, 1996 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 15498, Oct. 2, 1996 (S. D.

Chambers v. Peach County, supra, 266 Ga. at 321.</div><div class="casepar">The preamble to the amending ordinance passed by the Marietta City Council stated that the city council's enactment of the amendment was based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities believed to be relevant to Marietta's problems, and a review of a Marietta police report concerning criminal activity around the three existing clubs offering adult entertainment and alcohol. The preamble also contained the city council's finding that "public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages and so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment begets criminal activity and tends to create undesirable community conditions." The preamble listed as "undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol" the depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, the increased expenditure for law enforcement, the increased burden on the judicial system due to increased criminal behavior, and acceleration of community blight caused by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. The transcript of the city council meeting at which the ordinance amendment was discussed and passed reflects that citizens and elected representatives voiced concern about property values and the need to close nude dancing establishments. The transcript also shows that council members considered studies from other cities which showed a correlation between the presence of adult entertainment and an increase in crime. The city's chief of police appeared at the council meeting and stated that the rate of calls for police service was slightly higher in the area surrounding the three licensees than at other establishments serving alcohol. He acknowledged that his statistics reflected calls for police service made from the areas studied, and that each call did not reflect the commission of a crime. In affidavits executed after the lawsuits at bar were filed, each of the council members who voted in favor of the ordinance amendment swore that he/she relied upon the testimony and evidence presented at the city council meeting at which the ordinance amendment was passed, including the studies from other cities. Each council member averred that the studies were "relevant to the City of Marietta, the problems faced by the City of Marietta and the problems addressed by the Ordinance."</div><div class="casepar">Appellants Tudor and Cyprus Lounge assert that the trial court's finding, implicit in its application of the Paramount Pictures test, that the ordinance was content-neutral was erroneous in light of evidence that the mayor and several council members expressed a desire in published reports to eliminate nude dancing establishments from Marietta.

Judicial inquiry into legislative motives or purposes is a "hazardous matter," for what motivates one legislator to make a comment about a law is not necessarily what motivates fellow legislators to enact the law. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 383 (88 SC 1673, 20 LE2d 672) (1968). If it is established that the "predominate intent" of the enacted legislation was to combat or avoid pernicious secondary effects, then the legislation is deemed to be content-neutral. See City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres,supra, 475 U. S. at 48. With these standards in mind, we conclude that the evidence upon which appellants rely is insufficient as a matter of law to establish improper intent. Ambassador Books &amp; Video v. Little Rock, supra, 20 F3d 858; Colacurcio v. City of Kent, 1996 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 16514 (W.D. Wash.) (Nov. 1, 1996). In light of the city council's predominate goal of combating pernicious secondary effects and the lack of sufficient evidence to establish an improper motive on the part of council members, we conclude the ordinance is content-neutral.</div><div class="casepar">5. Since the ordinance amendment was content-neutral, we apply the tripartite Paramount Pictures test to determine whether the restriction imposed on expression passes constitutional muster: (1) Does the ordinance further an important governmental interest? (2) Is that interest unrelated to the suppression of speech? and (3) Is the legislation an incidental restriction of speech no greater than essential to further the important governmental interest? Chambers v. Peach County, supra, 266 Ga. at 319. As noted above, the stated purpose of the ordinance amendment was to control criminal behavior and prevent undesirable community conditions. A city has a substantial government interest in "attempting to preserve the quality of urban life . . . ." City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, supra, 475 U. S. at 50. The "reduction of criminal activity and prevention of the deterioration of neighborhoods are important government interests . . . ." Discotheque v.

The city substantiated its declaration that the amended ordinance was necessary to curb the unwanted secondary effects of mixing alcohol and adult entertainment through the experiences of other cities that the council members reasonably believed to be relevant to the problems faced by Marietta. The city's desire to preserve the quality of urban life and its attempt to reduce crime and prevent neighborhood deterioration by separating alcohol from adult entertainment are important government interests unrelated to the suppression of speech. Id. Finally, the ordinance's application is sufficiently narrowly tailored because it is limited to the modes of expression implicated in the production of negative secondary effects -- those establishments that provide alcohol and entertainment requiring an adult entertainment license -- thereby exempting mainstream performance houses, museums, or theaters.

The contention addressed in Division 1 (a) of Peavy was whether the issuance of a business license in and of itself, without regard to the property owner's investment in the business, was sufficient to create a vested right. Here, of course, the issue is whether the appellants have acquired a vested right to operate their businesses because they obtained the appropriate licenses pursuant to the adult entertainment ordinance and because they made substantial expenditures to put the businesses into operation. Furthermore, although we held in Peavy that the fact that the appellant had obtained a business license was not enough, by itself, to give her a vested right, we did not hold that this factor was dispositive of the appeal. Instead, we addressed whether Peavy had a vested right in her lawful, pre-existing use based upon the expenditures she had made. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> Peavy thus implicitly stands for the proposition that a person operating a business can obtain a vested right based upon expenditures even if that person cannot acquire vested rights based upon the business license.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, I find no rational reason to treat an adult entertainment ordinance like the one in this case any differently from a zoning ordinance for purposes of determining vested rights. First, Peavy itself acknowledged that "the general aim of both zoning and licensing regulations is the promotion of the general welfare." Second, zoning regulations, like licensing regulations, are subject to change at any time if the local government believes that the change will promote the general welfare of the community. Third, the adult entertainment ordinance in this case is in fact a combination zoning-licensing scheme, containing numerous traditional zoning features. Finally, here, unlike many licensing regulations, including the one at issue in the Colorado case on which the majority relies, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> the adult entertainment ordinance was amended so as to entirely preclude the businesses that the appellants had been operating -- lounges featuring nude dancing.</div><div class="casepar">Because the adult entertainment ordinance at issue is a combination zoning-licensing scheme, because the ordinance's amendment precludes a pre-existing use of the property, and because zoning and licensing schemes share a common goal of furthering the general welfare of the public, I would apply to this case the well-established principle that the termination of a pre-existing use of property that does not constitute a nuisance and has not been abandoned generally is confiscatory unless there is a reasonable amortization period in which to bring the use to a close. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> Under that test, I believe that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the appellees. I therefore dissent.</div><div class="casepar">Michael J. Bowers, Attorney General, Daniel M. Formby, Deputy Attorney General, John B. Ballard, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General, W.

      Cyprus Lounge had adult entertainment and liquor licenses for 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995; Boomer's had the necessary permits for 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, and Goldrush II for 1993, 1994, and 1995.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      According to the trial court's order, the parties agreed in December 1995 that the businesses could continue to serve alcohol and provide adult entertainment pending resolution of appeals filed in this Court.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      The ballot read as follows:Shall the Constitution of the State of Georgia be amended so that alcoholic beverages and activities involving nudity and alcoholic beverages, such as in nude dance clubs, may be regulated, restricted, or prohibited by counties and municipalities and so that the state shall have full and complete authority to regulate alcoholic beverages under the powers granted by the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution?</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      Georgia is not alone in using its state constitutional guaranty of freedom of expression, unburdened by a "mini-Twenty-first Amendment," to find unconstitutional a statute or ordinance proscribing nude dancing in establishments with liquor licenses. See Mickens v. City of Kodiak, 640 P2d 818 (Alaska 1982); Bellanca v. NY State Liquor Auth., 429 NE2d 765, 445 NYS2d 87 (1981); Commonwealth v. Sees, 373 NE2d 1151 (Mass. 1978); Cleveland's P.M. on the Boardwalk v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 231 (Jan. 23, 1997); Sekne v. City of Portland, 726 P2d959 (Or. App. 1986). Cf. Knudtson v. City of Coates, 519 NW2d 166 (Minn. 1994) (where the Minnesota Supreme Court, after noting that the Minnesota Constitution did not contain a provision equivalent to the Twenty-first Amendment, found the ordinance in question did not violate the state constitution's free speech guaranty because it was a reasonable exercise of police power only incidentally controlling free speech); City of Billings v. Laedeke, 805 P2d 1348 (Mont. 1991) (where the Montana Supreme Court noted the absence from its state constitution of a Twenty-first Amendment equivalent and then determined that Montana's free speech guaranty was co-extensive with the First Amendment).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
      The Twenty-first Amendment to the U. S. Constitution did two things: it repealed the Eighteenth Amendment which totally prohibited the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within the United States and its territories, and it "delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use of, alcoholic beverages." 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. ---- (116 SC 1495, 134 LE2d 711) (1996).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      An entertainment program may not be prohibited solely because it contains nudity. Schad v. Borough of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 67 (101 SC 2176, 68 LE2d 671) (1981). The "customary 'barroom' type of nude dancing" may involve expression minimally protected by the First Amendment. Doran v. Salem Inn, supra, 422 U. S. at 932.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      The states may delegate the broad power given them by the Twenty-first Amendment "as they see fit." City of Newport v. Iacobucci, supra, 479 U. S. at 96. A state's failure to delegate its Twenty-first Amendment authority to local governments within the state has resulted in a local ordinance being found unconstitutional. See Connor v. Town of Hilton Head Island, <span class="casemissing">442 SE2d 608</span> (S.C. 1994). Cf. Krueger v. City of Pensacola, 759 F2d 851, 854 (11th Cir. 1985), where the 11th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that Florida's failure to delegate its Twenty-first Amendment regulatory authority to local governments required the city to justify its ordinance under "[a] stricter standard typically used to review an infringement on a protected liberty interest justified solely under the government's police power.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note8" href="#source8">8</a></span>&nbsp;
      The Paramount Pictures three-pronged study of statutes and ordinances to determine whether the free expression guaranty of the Georgia Constitution has been violated is derived from the analytical framework applied by federal courts when measuring legislative enactments against the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution. Paramount Pictures, supra, 250 Ga. at 255, n. 5.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      As Ward makes clear, determining whether legislation is content-neutral depends upon the governing body's purpose in passing the legislation. Accordingly, the content of the legislation, i.e., the regulation of adult entertainment establishments, does not control whether the legislation is content-neutral. This Court's statement in Club Southern Burlesque v. City of Carrollton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../242/5/index.html">265 Ga. 528 (1) (457 SE2d 816) (1995)</a></span>, rejecting the club's contention that the ordinance regulating adult entertainment establishments was not content-neutral, should not be read as a holding that all ordinances regulating adult entertainment establishments are content-neutral. As noted in Club Southern, the Paramount Pictures standard of review is used only when the questioned legislation is found to be content-neutral, and the use of the Paramount Pictures test in two earlier cases reviewing ordinances nearly identical to the ordinance being reviewed in Club Southern led to the conclusion that the Club Southern ordinance was also content-neutral.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;
      As set forth in fn. 2, the businesses continue to operate by means of an agreement among the parties. Consequently, appellants have not yet been denied a license under the amended ordinance since they have not applied for licenses after the effective date of the amended ordinance. We nonetheless address the issue because it is clear that, but for the parties' agreement, appellants would have applied for and would have been denied alcohol licenses, based on the amended ordinance, if they wished to continue operating as they have in the past.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note11" href="#source11">11</a></span>&nbsp;
      In Harris v. Entertainment Systems, supra, <span class="casemissing">259 Ga. 701 (2)</span>, this Court expressly noted that it made "no determination as to the nature of the property interest, only that it is sufficient to meet the [equity] exception set out in Moultrie [Milk Shed v.
