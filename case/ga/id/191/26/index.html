H. Hughes and others filed a petition to enjoin Byrd Griner, Ordinary of Berrien County, Georgia, from proclaiming the result of an election to determine whether on not there shall be a "fence" or "no-fence" law in the said county. The prayer, in addition to a request for a temporary and permanent injunction, asked that the court declare the election void and of no effect, and that no valid election had been held in Berrien County to determine whether or not the stock or "no-fence" law should be put in effect. The equitable grounds in the petition for declaring the election void are predicated on three main points, which are: (1) Code  62-501 states that, when an election is held for the purpose of submitting to the voters of a county the question of "fence" or "no-fence," the said election shall be held at the courthouse or ground in each militia district; and this provision of law is mandatory and a condition precedent that the polling places be as designated, and this provision of law was not carried out, in that in five militia districts the said election was held in schoolhouses of the militia districts rather than at the courthouses or court grounds as required by law. (2) Such an election shall be held under the same rules and regulations as provided in Code  34-1202, which provides that each manager holding such an election must take and subscribe an oath as to bow he will carry out his duties, and the managers holding the election have never taken and subscribed to the required oath. (3) Code  62-501 requires that returns of said election shall be made to the ordinary who, after examining the same, shall proclaim the result by notice posted for 30 days at the most public places declaring the result of the election; and, although the returns were duly received, Byrd Griner has never posted or published the results and the law has never been operative, nevertheless it is being contended that the law is of force and effect in the county. The petition further alleges that, although the required provisions of law were not complied with, a form of election was held, and it was contended that the election for "no-fence" carried; that it is contended that the stock or "no-fence" law is now of force and effect, and the petitioners, who are raisers and producers of livestock, will be molested and harassed if they permit their stock to run at large; and, being without any remedy at law, they will suffer "irrevocable damage in money" unless a court of equity intervenes and protects the rights of the petitioners; and that endless litigation will result in a multiplicity of suits growing out of the illegal election unless the court can by declaratory judgment or otherwise determine the validity of said election. General and special demurrers were filed to the petition and, after a hearing, each and every ground was sustained, and the petition was dismissed. The bill of exceptions is here to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> Failure to comply with mandatory prerequisites to the holding of a special election, such as filing a petition to call the election as provided by law or advertising the election as required by law, renders the election void and equity will take jurisdiction and so decree. Whittle v. Whitley, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 633</span> (44 S. E. 2d, 241); Barrentine v. Griner, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 830</span> (55 S. E. 2d, 536). It is equally well settled that irregularities and even outright violations of provisions of the law prescribing the manner for holding elections will in no case be relieved against in equity unless it is further shown that the result of the election was affected thereby. Collins v. Huff, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. 207</span>; Jossey v. Speer, <span class="casemissing">107 Ga. 828</span> (33 S. E. 718); Tanner v. Deen, <span class="casemissing">108 Ga. 95</span> (33 S. E. 832); Slate v. Mayor &amp;c. of Blue Ridge, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 646</span> (38 S. E. 977). Applying these rules to the complaints set forth in the petition as a basis for the relief sought, we must inevitably arrive at the following conclusions: The complaint that the election managers failed to take the oath required by Code  34-1202 shows a mere irregularity; and, since it was not alleged that this in any wise affected the result of the election, it would not therefore be a ground for relief in equity. Jossey v. Speer, supra, and Tanner v. Deen, supra. The further complaint that in five of the precincts of the county the election was held in schoolhouses instead of in the courthouses or grounds as provided in Code  62-501 shows an irregularity that might have rendered the election as to those precincts void ( Dyson v. Pope, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. 205</span>; Walker v. Sanford, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. 165</span>, 1 S. E. 424; 18 Am. Jur. 852,  114); but, in the absence of an allegation that, when all votes at those precincts are thrown out, the result of the election would be changed, this complaint would be an insufficient ground for equity intervention. The third and final ground of complaint set forth in the petition is, first, that the ordinary has not proclaimed the result of the election by publishing notice thereof as required by Code  62-501, and secondly, that the ordinary is threatening to so advertise the result and, if permitted to do so, the petitioners will be injured, and the petition prays that he be enjoined from so advertising the results of such election. The Code section just referred to provides that the returns of the election must be made to the ordinary, and that he shall examine the same and shall decide on all questions that arise out of the election and then proclaim the result. While the statute places upon the ordinary the duty to publish notice of the result, it does not specify precisely when he shall start such publication; consequently it must be held, in the present case, that the election is not shown to be void because the publication has not yet been done. Failure by the ordinary to publish his proclamation of the result would not prevent the election from becoming effective, for it is declared in Code  62-501 that, "if the lawful majority in said election is for 'no-fence,' then said provisions shall take effect in such county within six months thereafter." On the other hand, equity will not prevent this official from performing the duty of advertising the result, which is placed upon him by the statute. 28 Am. Jur. 352,  162. Equity is never antagonistic to the law, but follows the law. Code,  37-103. The foregoing analysis of the grounds of complaint shows an absence of grounds, under the rules of law, for the equitable relief sought. Therefore the court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and in dismissing the petition.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Franklin, Eberhardt &amp; Barham, for defendant.</div><div class="caselawyer">L.
