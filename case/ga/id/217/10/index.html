Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Shoob.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On January 17, 1997, Joel Griffin filed suit against AirTouch Cellular of Georgia, Inc. in Civil Action No. E55480, Fulton Superior Court, because AirTouch rounded up its billing for air time rates to the next minute without contract or Public Service Commission authorization, and he sought class action certification for his suit. On March 2, 1997, Doug Smith in Civil Action No. E56092, Fulton Superior Court, brought a similar suit against AirTouch. On March 11, 1997, Marlene S. Sharple and G. Katherine Saba in Civil Action No. E56074, Fulton Superior Court, brought a similar suit against AirTouch.</div><div class="casepar">AirTouch answered each suit and pled as its first defense res judicata: that a Georgia resident, Darryl B. Cohen, sued AirTouch on the same basis on September 12, 1995, in Cohen v. AirTouch Cellular, in Civil Action No. 972438, California Superior Court of San Francisco County; that a class action was granted for California, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, and Ohio; that the suit was amended to include AirTouch of Georgia, Inc. as a defendant; that on July 19, 1996, the trial court approved the notice to all past and present subscribers of AirTouch's cellular telephone service; that notice went to current subscribers through their August and September statements; that former subscribers received notice by repeated publication in each market; that AirTouch paid the cost of notice, $871,777.88; that on December 13, 1996, the trial court approved the settlement as final and binding on all class members who had not opted out; that class notice went to each of the plaintiffs; and that none of the plaintiffs timely opted out of the class action settlement. On April 29, 1998, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the settlement.</div><div class="casepar">On April 2, 1999, the Fulton Superior Court granted summary judgment on the basis of res judicata and entered the judgment of record as to each case on April 5, 1999. The trial court correctly held that res judicata barred each case.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs' sole enumeration of error in all three cases is the same, i.e., that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of res judicata from the California class action consent judgment. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">1. Full faith and credit must be accorded the final California judgment by the courts of Georgia. U. S. Const. Art. IV,  1; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/7/24/index.html">24-7-24</a></span>; Williamson v. Williamson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../762/9/index.html">247 Ga. 260</a></span>, 261-262 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../762/9/index.html">275 SE2d 42</a></span>) (1981); Chrison v.

"Choice of law provisions that may appropriately be considered prior to judgment are simply not material or relevant when considering the effect of a judgment entered in a foreign action." Id.</div><div class="casepar">2. Purposeful minimum contacts with the forum state by a non-resident defendant satisfy due process. See Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235 (78 SC 1228, 2 LE2d 1283) (1958). However, as to absent class action plaintiffs, procedural due process is not an issue for purposes of jurisdiction, because the class has submitted itself voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the forum by making an appearance in court through their class representative without opting out of the class action. To satisfy procedural due process <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> for absent class members and to bind them by judgment, there must be only (1) notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> (2) opportunity to opt out of the proceeding; and (3) adequate class representation. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797 (105 SC 2965, 86 LE2d 628) (1985). In rejecting the minimum contacts argument as to absent class action plaintiffs, the U. S. Supreme Court carefully considered the argument and held that the reasons for minimum contacts for a defendant did not exist for absent class action plaintiffs, who had adequate representation through the class representative. Id.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, the procedural due process clause conditions were all fully met. The class representative was a knowledgeable Georgia lawyer. These plaintiffs each received actual notice by first class mail, which prompted their suits. The California trial court found the conditions to have been satisfied. In this case, the trial court also found that they had been satisfied in granting summary judgment, as do we.</div><div class="casepar">3. The California judgment has been neither reversed nor set aside; therefore, it has res judicata effect. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/12/40/index.html">9-12-40</a></span>; Gilmer v. Porterfield, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/76/index.html">233 Ga. 671</a></span>, 674 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/76/index.html">212 SE2d 842</a></span>) (1975). For res judicata to operate as a bar to a subsequent action, there must exist (1) a valid antecedent judgment, including jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (2) identity of parties; (3) identity of issues; and (4) no public policy reason why a strict application of res judicata should not apply in the case. Fierer v. Ashe, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../538/50/index.html">147 Ga. App. 446</a></span>, 448 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../538/50/index.html">249 SE2d 270</a></span>) (1978). In other words, there must be (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of actions; and (3) adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction. See Crowe v. Congress Financial Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/07/index.html">196 Ga.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 806</span>, 807 (5) (<span class="casemissing">184 SE 791</span>) (1936). The judgment must be an adjudication on the merits of the case for res judicata to apply. See Piedmont Cotton Mills v.

Couch, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../600/40/index.html">129 Ga. App. 625 (200 SE2d 493) (1973)</a></span>. The California Superior Court in approving the class action settlement had to pass preliminarily upon the merits of the case to determine that it was fair to the class. See id. at 628. Thus, the California judgment cannot be collaterally attacked on the merits or procedurally.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Court of competent jurisdiction. The California Superior Court, as a general jurisdiction court, had subject matter jurisdiction to try class action suits sounding in tort and in contract. See generally Morris v. Jones, 329 U. S. 545, 550-551 (67 SC 451, 91 LE 488) (1947). Thus, it was a court of competent jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Final judgment. The California Superior Court entered a final judgment that terminated the class action. The judgment was appealed to the California Court of Appeals by one of the class members, but the judgment was affirmed without application for certiorari to the California Supreme Court. Thus, the judgment was final and not contingent.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Adjudication on the merits.</div><div class="casepar">[A]n adjudication on the merits does not require that the litigation should be determined on the merits, in the moral or abstract sense of these words. It is sufficient that the status of the action was such that the parties might have had their suit thus disposed of, if they had properly presented and damaged their respective cases. Thus, it is only where the merits were not and could not have been determined under a proper presentation and management of the case that res judicata is not a viable defense. If, pursuant to an appropriate handling of the case, the merits were or could have been determined, then the defense is valid.</div><div class="casepar">(Citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original.) Piedmont Cotton Mills v. Woelper, supra at 110.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Identity of parties. For res judicata to bar a subsequent action, there must be the identity of parties or their privies so that they were before the same court at the same time when the judgment was rendered.

Northern Propane Gas Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../667/6/index.html">251 Ga. 674 (308 SE2d 544) (1983)</a></span>. The California trial court approved the settlement of the class action on behalf of the class. The California class action had as the class representative a Georgia resident, and the class action represented multiple states, including Georgia. Therefore, present and former subscribers of AirTouch were members of the class unless they opted out. The plaintiffs were members of the Georgia class and did not opt out. There existed an identity of parties.</div><div class="casepar">(f) Pendency of simultaneous actions. When the plaintiffs filed their suits, the California action had a final judgment and was on appeal.

This rule is not affected by the failure to plead the pendency of the latter action.</div><div class="casepar">(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Darling Stores Corp. v.

      Collateral attack on a foreign judgment is permitted only when procedural due process has been violated for lack of either subject matter or personal jurisdiction over the defendant, as shown by each of the cases cited by the plaintiffs. This was not the situation in this case.However, plaintiffs seek to make a collateral attack, nonetheless, by a conflict of law argument that there was a substantive due process violation in the California judgment. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797 (105 SC 2965, 86 LE2d 628) (1985). In Shutts, the substantive due process issue of conflict of law came in a direct appeal of the judgment and not as a collateral attack on the judgment when full faith and credit were sought to be applied for res judicata purposes. Plaintiffs' conflict of law/due process attack exists to permit a collateral attack on the California judgment and to allow a new class action to proceed in Georgia. Since the case settled in California with the trial court's approval and was not tried, then the trial court under its procedural law did not have to finally determine which state's substantive law to apply, including other states' conflict of law rules, but did appropriately use California procedural law. Therefore, no conflict of law/due process violation occurred, as in Shutts, supra, because procedural law in a class action under conflict of law follows the law of the forum. See Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 723 (108 SC 2117, 100 LE2d 743) (1988). However, in the approval order, the California trial court had to make a preliminary evaluation of the case on its merits, which it did by looking to the substantive law from other states. Since approval of a class action settlement does not require a final decision on the substantive law merits, including applicable conflict of law rules, and does not require the trial court to expressly consider the law of every state involved, then there existed no conflict of law/substantive due process clause violation when the trial court made no final decision as to the applicable substantive law of other states. See Class Plaintiffs v.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Plaintiffs raise an adequacy of notice through publication in the market for former subscribers; since the plaintiffs all were subscribers and received notice through their monthly statements, then they lack standing to raise this on behalf of past subscribers, because no class has been certified in any of these cases, and they were not personally aggrieved by lack of notice.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
