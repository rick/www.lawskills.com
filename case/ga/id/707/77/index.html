J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">No error of law appearing from any of the special assignments of error, and there being legal evidence supporting the verdict in favor of the defendant, the trial court properly denied the plaintiff's amended motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">On January 14, 1953, Erle M. Donalson, as attorney for Mary Moore, Alice Moore, Thomzie Moore, Robert Moore, Eugene Moore, and Roosevelt Brown, heirs at law of W. J. Moore, deceased, and owners of land lot 176 of the 16th district of Decatur County, Georgia, sued out a dispossessory proceeding under Code  61-301 et seq., against Melvin Johnson, before a justice of the peace of Decatur County, deposing that there had been no administration on the estate of the decedent, who had died intestate, and that the said Johnson was in possession of said premises as tenant of a farm on said land, which he had cultivated in 1952, and was holding over and beyond his term, and setting up that they had demanded possession of the land and the tenant had refused to deliver possession to them. A dispossessory warrant issued and notice to vacate was served on the tenant. The tenant, Johnson, filed a counter-affidavit, in which he deposed: that he was not holding possession over and beyond his term; that on November 4, 1950, he entered into a contract in writing with W. J. Moore to rent this farm, containing 97 acres, for $325 per annum to be paid on October 1 of each year beginning October 1, 1951, and ending on the last day of December, 1955, and which contract provided that he should have possession of the place on January 1, 1951, and that 15 acres of the peanut allotment went to this place; that affiant paid the rent according to the terms of the contract in 1951 to W. J. Moore, and in 1952 the rent was paid to the said legal heirs, according to the evidence, and under said contract he is entitled to said farm for 1953, 1954, and 1955, provided that he pays the agreed amount of rent.</div><div class="casepar">The case was returnabIe to the Superior Court of Decatur County; it proceeded to trial on the issue formed by the affidavit and counter affidavit, and resulted in a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiffs moved for a new trial and by amendment added three special grounds. The defendant introduced in evidence a writing in which he agreed to pay $325 a year as rent, and which stated that the defendant was to have a five-year term of rental. The signature of W. J. Moore had been on this writing, but with the assent of the defendant and at the direction of Moore, the officer who prepared it had erased the signature of Moore from the instrument, stating to Moore that his name was not necessary. Testimony of one Shirah, a witness to the instrument, that the deceased Moore stated that he wanted to give the defendant a paper so if anything happened to him, he could have the farm for five years, was objected to by the plaintiffs--"We object to anything Moore said on the ground that this purported lease was for five years, and therefore created an estate and was required to be in writing, and nothing can be added to or taken away from it," and that "it must be in writing and nothing by way of oral conversation can be added to it or taken away from it, and nothing said in connection with it could be admissible. The trial court admitted this testimony, and error is assigned thereon in the amended motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant introduced, over objection of the plaintiffs, the original instrument, designated as "Farm Rent Note" and "Original Farm Rent Note." This writing provided for the payment of $325 a year for five years, as contended by the defendant. It also provided: "This rent note is made for five years at $325 per year to be paid on the 1st day of October of each year beginning October 1, 1951, ending in the year 1955; to have possession of place January 1, 1951. Any default in the payment of rent cancels contract--being all of land lot No. 176 in the 16th district, containing 97 acres, more or less. The above described lands being the property of W. J. Moore in Decatur County, Georgia, and known as the Moore Place. 15 acres of peanut allotment goes to this rented farm." It was therein provided that the maker was to keep the place in repair. The instrument also provided that "This contract terminates on the 1st day of January, 1956." It was signed "W. J. Moore (L.S.)," and there is. a line drawn through this signature. It is also signed "Melvin Johnson (L.S.)." It was executed in the presence of J. O. Shirah and Fred Knighton, a notary public.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs objected to the introduction of this instrument in evidence on the ground that it was not signed by the parties, and that, if it had been signed by Moore, he had directed that his signature be stricken, and this was done in his presence. The court admitted this instrument, and error is assigned thereon in the amended motion for new trial, "because any contract for any interest in or concerning land creating the relation of landlord and tenant, if made for a greater tinge than one year must be in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith, and the uncontradicted evidence shows . . . that while W. J. Moore, the party to be charged therewith, had signed the paper, his signature had been stricken" at his direction by Knighton, and in the defendant's presence. The plaintiffs further assigned error in that it does not appear that both parties have in writing agreed to the same contract, and because there was nothing to enforce, and in that said instrument shows on its face that it is merely a promissory note for five years' rental.</div><div class="casepar">In special ground 3 error is assigned on a charge of the court, and is dealt with in the ensuing opinion.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court denied the motion for new trial as amended, and to this judgment the plaintiffs except.</div><div class="casepar"> The plaintiffs objected to the admission in evidence of the instrument, originally signed by W. J. Moore as the landlord or lessor, and by the defendant as tenant, which instrument clearly stated that the landlord desired to let the fang premises to the defendant Johnson for five years; and they also objected to the testimony of one of the witnesses to this instrument, to the effect that the landlord stated in the presence of this witness and in the presence of the defendant and the other witness, the notary public Knighton, that he intended thereby to grant a five-year lease to the defendant, and desired to execute this writing so as to protect the tenant if anything should happen to him. It is true that there is a line drawn through the signature of Moore. The witness Shirah testified that the landlord stated, "I want him [the defendant] to have the use of it [the farm] for five years," and that was the reason he signed the instrument; and this witness further testified, "After Moore signed this paper, Fred Knighton [the other witness and notary public who drew the paper] struck through his name on it," stating that it was not necessary for Moore's name to be on it.</div><div class="casepar">The intention of the parties shall govern, if such intention can be ascertained, and contravenes no rule of law. The cardinal rule of construing contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties. See Code  20-702, 20-703, 20-704. Under the facts presented by the record now before the court, this question was for the jury, and this evidence was not irrelevant and immaterial, and such testimony admitted in evidence and the purported contract were properly for the purpose of showing that it was the intention of the lessor Moore to grant to the defendant Johnson a five-year lease for the premises, and that there was a written contract to this effect.</div><div class="casepar">A finding by the jury that W. J. Moore intended to give the defendant a lease to this farm for a term of five years, and that he gave such lease to him, as evidenced by the writing, is fully authorized by the evidence. A nephew of the deceased lessor testified that his uncle stated that he was renting the farm to Melvin Johnson, the defendant, for five years. The jury found in favor of the defendant, and this verdict was supported by the evidence. No error appears from the admission by the trial court of the instrument, representing a note for the rent and a contract to rent for five years. This instrument had therein a provision that the tenant would keep the premises in repair. While it is true that a lease of land exceeding one year must be in writing (Killian v. Cherokee County, <span class="casemissing">169 Ga. 313</span>, 150 S. E. 158; Code  61-102), we think that the writing here, introduced to show such a contract, under the facts presented in this case, was sufficient for the jury to base their finding that there existed a five-year written contract of rental between the parties.</div><div class="casepar">Under the view which we take of this case, the trial court did not err in charging the jury that it was for them to determine under all the facts "whether the instrument in question is. a lease or not." The jury resolved this issue against the plaintiff, and there was evidence tending to show that this finding was in conformity with the law and with the intention of the deceased landlord.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the trial court did not err in denying the plaintiffs' motion for new trial as amended.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Townsend and Carlisle, JJ., concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Erle M.
