This was the largest rate request ever submitted to the commission and resulted in its longest proceedings -- 42 days of hearings over five months, producing over 12,000 pages of transcripts and 502 exhibits. An increase of approximately $464 million was authorized.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal revolves around the rate base. The PSC denied rate recognition of $951 million of the Company's submitted costs. The superior court affirmed, and the Company disputes $896 million of the superior court's affirmance. The significance of the disallowances is that they substantially reduce the figure on which the rate increase is computed, to the Company's detriment.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court in a comprehensive, detailed order described the issues, the facts which it decided were supported by evidence, the related law, and the court's rationale with respect to each issue. It is most helpful and provides the opportunity for an intelligent review because it gives the specific foundations for its rulings. See Atlanta Transit System v. Harcourt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../696/79/index.html">94 Ga. App. 503 (95 SE2d 41) (1956)</a></span>, regarding awards of the State Board of Workers' Compensation; the same applies to any appealable order.</div><div class="casepar">The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), one of numerous intervenors in the proceedings, appeals the affirmance of the PSC's findings based in part on alleged ex parte communications and the superior court's failure to reopen the record to allow evidence of that issue.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A90A0495 (AARP)</div><div class="casepar">1. The initial order of the PSC was issued October 1, 1987. AARP moved for reconsideration, but it did not include any ground based on the allegedly improper ex parte communications. On the same day, another intervenor, Consumers' Utility Counsel, filed a motion which included the allegation of ex parte communications. The motion was not adopted or joined by AARP. Both motions were denied. The PSC supplemented its original order thereafter, and appeal to the superior court ensued.</div><div class="casepar">Although filing a motion for reconsideration before the agency Is not a prerequisite to superior court review, "no objection to any order or decision of any agency shall be considered by the court upon petition for review unless such objection has been urged before the agency." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (c).</div><div class="casepar">The court correctly held that AARP's failure to raise the issue before the PSC precluded the court's consideration of it. "The authorization to the superior court set forth in [OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (g)] to hear evidence relating to alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency that are not shown in the record is an exception to the principle that review by the superior court shall be confined to the record but is not an exception to the principle stated in [OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (c)] requiring objections to agency decisions or orders to be urged in the first instance before the agency." Georgia Real Estate Comm. v. Burnette, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../898/8/index.html">243 Ga. 516 (1) (255 SE2d 38) (1979)</a></span>. See Georgia Public Svc. Comm. v.

During this period, planning, proposing, and construction startup were occurring for many of the nuclear plants now in existence or later cancelled. The original construction budget for Plant Vogtle was $660 million. It was to be a four-unit plant with two units optional for later expansion.</div><div class="casepar">The Company served as its own construction manager <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> during the project, selecting as architect/engineer the Bechtel Corporation. Significant design responsibilities for the Nuclear Steam Supply System and the piping hanger system were assigned to Southern Com pany Services, a component of the Southern Company, the parent of Georgia Power Company, and Westinghouse. The project was to follow the "design-build" or "fast track" method; i.e., no full project design existed as the project began but was being prepared contemporaneously. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The cost estimate continued to escalate until 1973, when it was made even higher by the oil embargo and general economic conditions. By October 1977, the estimate was $2.7 billion and the projected start date for commercial operation of Unit 1 slipped to November 1984.</div><div class="casepar">In March 1979, the Three Mile Island accident occurred, increasing regulation and oversight of such plants by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In October 1979, the Phase I Definitive Estimate based on site drawings and projected manhour and material costs was raised to $3.4 billion. Cost increases and schedule slips continued. By July 1985 the estimate hit $8.4 billion. Although costs rose even higher, the Company agreed in March 1986 to cap the costs in its rate request at $8.4 billion.</div><div class="casepar">The Company's appeal alleges eight enumerations, five of which (1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 6) deal with three categories of costs disallowed by the PSC and affirmed by the court: 1) embed plate fabrication and installation and 2) batch plant operations, both of which impacted the schedule of the project (the $516 million schedule disallowance), and 3) costs attributable to the Company's imprudence in managing the productivity of its work force (the $380 million productivity disallowance).</div><div class="casepar">Two enumerations (7 &amp; 8) cite error in the court's not requiring the PSC to explain why it did not offset alleged benefits to customers resulting from the delay in completion and the decision to attempt to minimize delay at the expense of productivity.</div><div class="casepar">Enumeration 5, addressed first, alleges error in the trial court's failure to hold that the admission of the expert opinion testimony of John Orr on productivity was error.</div><div class="casepar">2. In July 1985, because of the overruns and schedule problems experienced at Plant Vogtle, the PSC retained the consulting firm of O'Brien-Kreitzberg &amp; Associates (OKA) to examine the prudence of the Company's management of the project. During the two years before the rate hearings, OKA, both on site and by use of data requests from the Company, audited the project management both prospectively and retrospectively. In April 1987, OKA submitted to the PSC its written report, a draft of which had been previously submitted to the Company for its use and comment.</div><div class="casepar">The report contained the credentials of the members of the panel of experts including John Orr, its principal author. The panel testified before the PSC beginning May 26, 1987. Mr. Orr was extensively cross-examined by the Company as to his qualifications to express an opinion on productivity during construction of a nuclear facility. No formal objection to his testifying as an expert was made by the Company before, during or immediately after his testimony.</div><div class="casepar">At the close of the OKA panel's testimony, PSC counsel moved for the introduction into evidence of the five volumes of the OKA written report. The Company asked for and was granted time to file written objections to the introduction of these exhibits. On June 2, 1987, the Company filed its "Brief In Opposition To Admitting Certain Portions of Hearing Exhibits . . . 87 through 91." It contended that "OKA is not competent to render opinion testimony on the subject of Vogtle productivity in view of its total lack of experience in evaluating productivity on nuclear power plants," and objected for the first time to the testimony of the witnesses before the PSC.</div><div class="casepar">Since January 1, 1976, the Administrative Procedure Act has been applicable to proceedings of the PSC. Ga. L. 1975, p. 404; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/2/index.html">50-13-2</a></span> (1); Georgia Public Svc. Comm. v. Southern Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../587/9/index.html">254 Ga. 244</a></span>, 245, supra. The rules of evidence applicable in civil non-jury trials generally apply. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/15/index.html">50-13-15</a></span> (1). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/46/2/51/index.html">46-2-51</a></span>, governing the PSC only, provides that "the commission shall not be bound by the strict technical rules of . . . evidence but may exercise such discretion as will facilitate its efforts to ascertain the facts bearing upon the right and justice of the matters before it." This section dovetails with and complements OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/15/index.html">50-13-15</a></span> (1), since  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/46/2/51/index.html">46-2-51</a></span> comports with the standards regarding non-jury civil trials. See Foster v. Continental Cas. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../561/26/index.html">141 Ga.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/67/index.html">24-9-67</a></span>. "[OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/67/index.html">24-9-67</a></span>] provides that the opinion of an expert witness is admissible when based upon the proven facts of the case, and our courts have uniformly held that for the testimony of an expert witness to be received, his qualification as such must be first proved.

Making reviewability even more remote is the Company's total failure to object either to the qualifications of the witness before or during the testimony of that witness and its failure to object until long after the fact.</div><div class="casepar">The superior court recognized that determining relevancy and competency of evidence is within the PSC's authority and that the court had no power to disturb such a decision on review absent manifest abuse of discretion. Having not made any objection to the OKA report and testimony until after they became part of the body of evidence, the Company shows no abuse of discretion. Georgia Public Svc.

It is a general proposition that the total revenue requirement of a regulated utility is the sum total of its proper operating expenses, depreciation expense, taxes, and a reasonable return on the net valuation of its property that is used in the public service.

There should not be excluded from the finding of the base, investments which, under ordinary circumstances, would be deemed reasonable.

Costs incurred as a result of "imprudent action or inaction or [which] are unreasonable, excessive or unlawful are disqualified. . . ." The prudency standard was further defined by the PSC: "The standard by which management action is to be judged is that of reasonableness under the circumstances, given what was known or should have been known at the time the decision was made or the action was taken. The concept of prudence implies a standard or duty of care owed to others. In building a nuclear power plant, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires the utility to exercise a high standard of care in order to protect the public health and safety. Similarly, given the costs involved and the rate impact of those costs on monopoly customers, this commission finds that the utility should be held to a high standard of care in making decisions and taking actions in its planning and constructing such a project. Thus, while the standard to be applied is reasonableness under the circumstances, where the risk of harm to the public and ratepayer is greater, the standard of care expected from the reasonable person is higher. Given this standard . . ., a reasonable person is one who is qualified by education, training and experience to make the decision or take the action, using information available and applying logical reasoning processes."

The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important.' Id., at 602. This language, of course, does not dispense with all of the constitutional difficulties when a utility raises a claim that the rate which it is permitted to charge is so low as to be confiscatory: whether a particular rate is 'unjust' or 'unreasonable' will depend to some extent on what is a fair rate of return given the risks under a particular rate-setting system, and on the amount of capital upon which the investors are entitled to earn that return. At the margins, these questions have constitutional overtones." Duquesne, 102 LE2d at 658; see Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian, 771 P2d 1247, 1252 (Calif.

The Company contends that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the disallowance of costs attributed to the schedule delay, that is, the embed and batch plant problems, and the productivity disallowance. Evaluation of delay by the superior court and this court is premised on the "critical path" being the auxiliary building as concluded by OKA, rather than the control building as contended by the Company. "Critical path" is that part of the construction which, if delayed, impacts the remainder of the construction, or that without which it cannot proceed. See Wickmire &amp; Smith, The Use of Critical Path Method Techniques In Contract Claims, 7 Pub. Cont. L. J. 1, 43-45 (1974). OKA's location of the critical path is supported by evidence, including contemporaneous job documents and the fact that the Company's version of its critical path, not involving the auxiliary building, evolved after its receipt of the OKA draft report in November 1986.</div><div class="casepar">Embed Problems</div><div class="casepar">Embeds are flat metal plates to which are attached anchor rods and nuts which extend perpendicularly from the plates and are embedded into concrete as it is poured into the structure. They serve as support bases for piping and other mechanical structures that are part of the plant.</div><div class="casepar">In October 1978, the Company's Quality Assurance inspectors became aware of problems with the embeds. The fabrication specifications required that there be full thread engagement on the rods with the nuts. Because some of the rods did not meet these specifications and had "V" shaped ends, full engagement was not obtainable. Some rods had been installed without washers and with improper tack welding or with improperly sized nuts.</div><div class="casepar">All of this prompted a stop work order on the embed placement and on the concrete placement which was contingent on the embeds. The order was effective from November 21, 1978, until March 1979. Additional delay problems were caused by the lack of Quality Control Inspectors in April and May, and then problems with the concrete batch plant began.</div><div class="casepar">Batch Plant</div><div class="casepar">Because of the massive amounts of concrete required on a project of this size, the Company purchased a concrete batch plant in 1974 to install on site. The plant was stored for 2-1/2 years at the Company's Plant Hatch. The one-year manufacturer's warranty had expired by the time it was needed.</div><div class="casepar">When the batch plant was installed and began production, there were numerous problems causing delays. Included were computer problems with the scales, lack of certified inspectors, and inadequate ice plant capacity. Ice was required because the concrete had to be mixed with it instead of water to achieve the necessary temperature. This all began in May 1979, and the problems were repeatedly referred to in contemporaneous project records from July 1979 until the purchase of a second batch plant in September 1980. Other documentation also referred to the problems. Because the critical path was dependent on placement of concrete, this severely impacted the schedule and delayed the project.</div><div class="casepar">Thus there was evidence to support the finding of imprudence in the management of the embed and batch plant problems and the resultant schedule disallowance.</div><div class="casepar">Productivity Disallowance</div><div class="casepar">Productivity on a construction project is the number of labor manhours required to install one unit of work. The lower the required number of hours, the more efficient the work force is and the lower the cost for installing each unit. See U. S. Indus. v. Blake Constr. Co., 671 F2d 539, 546 (6) (D. C. Cir. 1982); Luria Bros. &amp; Co. v. United States, 369 F2d 701, 711-713 (15, 16, &amp; 17) (Ct. Cl. 1966).</div><div class="casepar">Production is the number of units installed in a given time, regardless of the manhours required to do it. It is less efficient and more costly, but it can make up time on a schedule. R. Cushman &amp; D. Carpenter, PROVING &amp; PRICING CONSTRUCTION CLAIMS 174-178 (1990). The more people working on a given task, the quicker it normally gets done, even if each person does not work as efficiently as when that person is working with fewer people.</div><div class="casepar">The Company acknowledges that it emphasized production at the expense of productivity and that it did not meet the productivity rates which it set internally. However, it adds, this was not unreasonable or imprudent, because the rates which it achieved were comparable to or better than rates achieved on other nuclear plants. The Company also contends that the use of its own schedules and productivity rates as a standard against which to measure the prudency of its actions was arbitrary and capricious.</div><div class="casepar">The use of industry rates as a starting point for analysis is appropriate and was done by OKA in its study. Yet such rates are not exclusive. The Company has cited no convincing authority for the proposition that using the owner's or contractor's estimated rates and schedules instead is arbitrary and capricious.</div><div class="casepar">There is general agreement that the factual circumstances presented in construction cases are so varied that each case must be determined on its particulars. Natkin &amp; Co. v. George A. Fuller Co., 347 FSupp. 17, 24 (2) (W. D. Mo. 1972). Thus, the conditions, rates and schedules on another nuclear project, while helpful in analysis, are not dispositive. The use of the rates and schedules prepared by the Company was not error. See Edwin J. Dobson, Jr., Inc. v. Rutgers, St. Univ., 384 A2d 1121, 1135-1137 (3) (Superior Court of N. J. 1978), aff'd sub nom. Broadway Maintenance Corp. v. Rutgers, St. Univ., 447 A2d 906 (Supreme Court of N. J. 1982).</div><div class="casepar">The arguments made by the Company against the use of its own rates and schedules are premised upon its view of the evidence and are primarily reargument that its version of the evidence should have been accepted. Its discussion of the other concurrent causes of delay, such as the increased regulatory oversight and weather delays, even if accepted by the PSC or the superior court, would not have automatically entitled the Company to full rate compensation for the delay and costs associated with it, as long as the Company's mismanagement was a substantial factor in the delay. See Havens Steel Co. v. Randolph Engineering Co., 613 FSupp. 514, 532 (11) (W. D. Mo. 1985), aff'd 813 F2d 186 (8th Cir. 1987).</div><div class="casepar">The purpose and nature of rate making, as set out in Division 3, is not to resolve fault or damages in the same sense that these issues are determined and litigated in contract and negligence disputes between owners, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. Instead, it is to set a fair and reasonable rate for both the ratepayer and the utility. The concept of damages caused by one of the parties to the construction project is not the issue in a rate-making case. The public is not one of those parties and had nothing within its control during the process. As noted by the PSC during the hearings, if the subcontractor fabricating the embeds or the supplier of the batch plant was contractually or negligently responsible for the delays, the Company has remedies against those parties and that loss need not be visited upon the rate payers. See, e.g., Nebraska Public Power Dist. v. Austin Power, 773 F2d 960 (8th Cir. 1985). In fact, the Company has claimed approximately $10,000,000 against Bechtel Corporation, although the record does not reflect the outcome.</div><div class="casepar">The schedule and productivity disallowances are supported by evidence and were judged against standards which were not arbitrary and capricious.</div><div class="casepar">Offsetting Benefits</div><div class="casepar">7. The Company also contends in enumerations 7 &amp; 8 that the superior court erred in not requiring the PSC to explain why it had not offset alleged benefits to customers as a result of the schedule disallowance and the minimization of the schedule delays at the expense of productivity, and that such failure of the PSC to explain its analysis of this theory was an abuse of discretion under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (h) (6).</div><div class="casepar">The same holds true under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (h).</div><div class="casepar">Nothing in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/17/index.html">50-13-17</a></span> or in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/46/2/25/index.html">46-2-25</a></span>, the latter of which sets out the procedure for changing rates, requires the PSC to affirmatively list all of the evidence or arguments it considered so as to show that it has considered everything. It must be assumed that it fulfilled its duty to consider what was presented to it. Moreover, in its 138-page order, the PSC reviews the entire proceedings in detail and states: "During the 'Prudency Phase' of the case, including the Company's direct case, the Staff and Intervenors' direct case and the Company's rebuttal case, this Commission heard from nine individual witnesses and thirteen panels of witnesses, with each panel consisting of two to six witnesses."</div><div class="casepar">The Company unsuccessfully argued twice before the PSC that the productivity disallowance and the scheduling disallowance were "mutually exclusive." The second time was on its motion for reconsideration. Its theory is that it could not be penalized for both disallowances since one was the result of and aimed at curing the problems created by the other. The PSC rejected this argument, as did the superior court. The superior court recognized that "[t]he two disallowances would be mutually exclusive only if the initial 14.6 months delay in construction were 'made up' by the increase in manpower which led to the productivity imprudence." There was evidence to support the PSC's and the superior court's conclusion that this did not occur, eliminating any discretion violation as contemplated by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/19/index.html">50-13-19</a></span> (h) (6).

It is judge of the facts, credibility, and weight, and no explanation is called for because these matters are not reviewable. See Lasseter, supra at 232.</div><div class="casepar">Nor does the law require the PSC to explain its rejection of particular theories put forth by any party as to the method used in arriving at the rate decision. If for no other reason, it is because the methods are not judicially reviewable. Savannah Elec. &amp;c. Co., supra at 160: "rate making is a legislative function involving the making of policy. It is the result of a rate order, not the method used to arrive at it, which governs." (Emphasis in original.)</div><div class="casepar">The Company claims that it was entitled by law to offsets. It contends first that it conclusively proved offsetting benefits, in a quantifiable way, through its financial analyst and certain other testimony, and second that the PSC is legally required to add such benefits into its calculation of the rate base.</div><div class="casepar">The argument fails. The Company's evidence of "benefits" was simply not adequate to convince the PSC. The PSC heard all this evidence and plainly rejected the notion that the Company in fact established that there were benefits to the ratepayers which should lessen the disallowances. Whether what the Company regarded as ratepayer "benefits" were in fact savings relevant against imprudency disallowances is problematic, based on a series of assumptions, and speculative.</div><div class="casepar">The only authority presented by the Company in support of its offsetting benefits theory before the superior court and the PSC was Macon-Bibb County &amp;c. Auth. v. Tuttle/White Constructors, 530 FSupp. 1048, 1055 (7, 8, &amp; 9) (M. D. Ga. 1981). That was a suit between the Authority and its contractor and subcontractor due to problems involving installation of sludge incinerators. The problems culminated in the cancellation of the Tuttle/White bid and the award of the contract to a different company at a savings to the Authority. The Authority asserted breach of contract and other claims, and the court applied an offsetting benefits rule. There is no authority requiring the application of such a rule in rate making by the PSC.</div><div class="casepar">Legislatively decided rate applications are a different species from judicially decided contract or negligence damages claims.

The legal entitlement which a party may claim in the setting of damages in the latter is only a matter of option when policy is being decided by the rate maker. See Duquesne Light Co., supra, where even a methodology requiring the utility to bear all the costs of a prudent investment was legally authorized.</div><div class="casepar">Summary</div><div class="casepar">The Company, a public servant and a monopoly, sought permission to increase charges to its customers for electricity because of the costs of building a nuclear generating plant. The public agency empowered to govern such charges agreed that an increase was justified but disallowed some of the costs in calculating the rate base for a fair Increase. The reason it did so was because it concluded that some of the costs were the result of the Company's imprudent management of the project in that some were attributable to avoidable delay and some were caused by poor productivity of the construction work force for whom the utility was ultimately responsible. The superior court, upon review, concluded that the agency's decision in these regards was within its bounds, and so do we.</div><div class="casepar">DEEN, Presiding Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</div><div class="casepar">While concurring fully with the majority opinion's affirmance of Case No. A90A0495, I must dissent in Case No. A90A0494, as it would be error to permit a $516,000,000 schedule delay disallowance if the factfinder failed to consider the expert testimony and evidence of offsetting benefits. "[N]either law nor economics has yet devised generally accepted standards for the evaluation of rate-making orders." Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 790 (88 SC 1344, 20 LE2d 312) (1968). (Emphasis supplied.) See Macon-Bibb County &amp;c. Auth. v. Tuttle/White Constructors, 530 FSupp. 1048, 1055 (7, 8, &amp; 9) (M. D. Ga. 1981), as to applicability of the offsetting benefits rule. In reviewing the record in this case, I conclude that the PSC's findings of fact do not show that it considered relevant testimony by experts that the construction delays such as occurred in the instant case may have also resulted in rate increase delays. Any benefits to the ratepayer resulting there from should have entered into, and thus offset, the PSC's calculations prior to arriving at the final rate increase. This would seem to be the more acceptable, fair, and equitable standard under the facts and law of this case.</div><div class="casepar">"A concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings" is required by the Georgia Administrative Procedures Act. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/13/17/index.html">50-13-17</a></span> (b). This requirement must be "inclusive enough to afford an intelligent review." American Century &amp;c. Investors v. Strickland, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../572/51/index.html">138 Ga. App. 657</a></span>, 660 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../572/51/index.html">227 SE2d 460</a></span>) (1976). (Emphasis supplied.) I do not question the arithmetical accuracy or mathematical methodology as to affirmative action taken on the issues and data that were considered; yet the findings set forth by the factfinder commission appear to be deficient as to one important point: there is a complete absence of facts reflecting consideration of testimony of experts as to offsetting benefits entering into the calculation and evaluation of the rate-making decision. We should reverse and remand for additional hearings, consideration of evidence as to offsetting benefits, and inclusion of additional underlying facts supporting the findings, which will thereafter afford an intelligent review.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Judge Birdsong, Judge Sognier, and Judge Pope join in this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Lipshutz, Greenblatt &amp; King, Martin L.
