Where an alleged carbon copy of a letter is offered in evidence, without any proof of there having been an original and the copy contains a signature only in type, it is error to allow the introduction thereof over timely objection that no foundation was shown for its introduction.</div><div class="casepar">2. Where the court undertakes to give in charge Code  38-107 on the preponderance of evidence, it is error to omit to charge that the jury should consider the credibility of witnesses as the same may legitimately appear on the trial, since in this case the complaining party depended entirely upon his oral testimony given on the trial.</div><div class="casepar">3. Since the single issue was whether or not the government's claim for taxes was barred by limitation, it was error to allow in evidence voluminous documents relating to offers of compromise of tax claims by parties who were not involved in the controversy, but were related to the party asserting the statute bar against his own taxes.</div><div class="casepar">4. The general grounds and special ground 3a are waived, and special ground 8a, based upon newly discovered evidence, requires no ruling since a new trial is ordered on other grounds.</div><div class="casepar">This case involves a bill of interpleader, being an equitable action to determine the rights of the defendants to certain funds in the hands of the petitioners, who are the executors of an estate. The defendants were the legatees, other than the petitioners, and two claimants to the share of Guyton Mitchell, one of the legatees. Both claimants filed answers in the form of interventions, and Guyton Mitchell also filed an answer. The other defendant legatees filed no pleadings. The funds, agreed on as being Guyton Mitchell's share of the estate, were paid into court; and the only issue remaining in the case being who should receive these funds, the other legatees had no further interest in the litigation.</div><div class="casepar">Since only the defendants Mitchell and the intervenor, the United States, are here involved, the court is concerned only with their respective contentions. It was agreed that the claim of the government for taxes was valid and prior to the claim of the holder of the common-law judgment, and the amount of the assessments for taxes was not controverted by the taxpayer, Mitchell. Thus the sole issue was whether or not the limitation period expired prior to the commencement of this action. Mitchell contends that he made an offer of compromise of the taxes in an amount of $500 on October 31, 1949, which would have tolled the limitation period while it was pending and for a year thereafter; that it was rejected about the middle of January 1950, and therefore the limitation period expired prior to the commencement of this action by the government on May 28, 1957. The government contends that the above offer was pending until rejected on April 30, 1954, and therefore the period of limitation will not expire until 1959 as to one assessment, and 1961 as to the other assessment.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the plaintiff in error, during the oral argument, waived the general grounds and one of the special grounds, and the court has for consideration only the complaints made in the remaining special grounds, alleging errors in the charge and in the allowance in evidence of certain papers over objection, and certain alleged newly discovered evidence.</div><div class="casepar">1. The sole issue between Guyton Mitchell and the United States as made by their pleadings was whether or not the United States' claim for taxes was barred by the statute of limitations (26 U. S. C. A.  6502), and this depended entirely upon the time when his offer of compromise was rejected. The first special ground complains because a paper purported to be a carbon copy of a letter from Mitchell Canneries, Inc., to the Collector of Internal Revenue was introduced over objections that the foundation for its introduction had not been laid. We reject at the outset the contentions of the government that it was admissible, not to prove facts, but to explain conduct. The decisions in Moss v. Youngblood, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 188</span> (200 S. E. 689), and in Altman v. Strouse, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../186/12/index.html">210 Ga. 282</a></span> (79 S. E. 2d 801), relied upon by counsel, do not support the contentions. Where the original is lost and accounted for, secondary evidence is allowed and is primary evidence. Code  38-702. To admit secondary evidence as here provided, it is necessary to prove that there has been an original and that it is lost. Bigelow v. Young, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. 121</span>; Durham v. Holeman, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. 619</span>; Gay v. DeMott, <span class="casemissing">153 Ga. 19</span> (111 S. E. 379); Bank of Manchester v. Birmingham Trust &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 486</span> (119 S. E. 603). But where it is proved that a genuine original was executed, proof that a proffered document is an exact carbon copy of that original is sufficient to admit in evidence the carbon copy without proving loss of the original. Carmichael Tile Co. v. McClelland, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../177/84/index.html">213 Ga. 656</a></span> (100 S. E. 2d 902). There was not a scintilla of evidence offered here to prove the execution or mailing, or receipt of an original. It was prejudicial, and the court erred in admitting it.</div><div class="casepar">Mitchell offered no evidence except his oral testimony, and in giving that testimony his credibility might well have been shown on the trial, but the charge forbade the jury's consideration thereof. The government's case was largely shown by documentary evidence, which could not be thus tested for credibility. Anyone experienced in the trial of cases knows the tremendous effect upon the jury of the personal appearance of witnesses. We are neither inclined nor allowed to speculate or guess that the jury was not affected by the charge. It was erroneous and presumptively it injured this complainant. The error demands a reversal.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special grounds 4a, 5a, 6a, and 7a are so similar that they will all be dealt with together. As pointed out above, the respective pleadings make a single issue for decision, and that is whether or not the admittedly correct tax claim of the government is barred by limitations, and this is determined by the time when the compromise offer of settlement was rejected, since the date it was made is agreed upon. This plain statement of the only issue demonstrates the utter irrelevancy of all matters not related thereto. It shows that offers of compromise of withholding taxes, of unemployment taxes, and old-age-benefit taxes for the years 1947 and 1948, made by Mitchell Canneries, Inc., excepted to in 4a, are wholly irrelevant to the true issue. Likewise, special ground 5a, excepting to what purports to be an amendment of a compromise offer by Mitchell Properties, Inc., which proposed to pay $18,500, and a letter attached reciting that other offers of compromise were withdrawn and are being paid in full, shows reversible error in allowing the documents over objections. Also ground 6a, excepting to the allowance in evidence, over objection, of documents purporting to be an offer of compromise by Virginia S. Mitchell of tax claims against her for 1946, as well as ground 7a, a statement purporting to have been attached to the offer of compromise made by Mitchell Canneries, Inc., were all meritorious exceptions and require a reversal.</div><div class="casepar">Since the parties knew a single simple issue was presented for determination, it should have been clearly evident that all this documentary evidence concerning totally different parties on entirely different matters would, instead of illuminating that issue, becloud and confuse it. And since all this voluminous documentary evidence related to parties in some way related to Guyton Mitchell, it tended to prejudice the jury against him.</div><div class="casepar">The contention of counsel for the government, that this documentary evidence tended to show that all tax matters including those of Guyton Mitchell were, with his consent, handled by Fondren Mitchell, and that it showed reasons for delay upon the part of the government in rejecting Guyton Mitchell's offer of compromise, is unsound, for the reason that it is utterly immaterial who handled his offer or what caused the delay, or any reason therefor, in rejecting it. The rejection is valid irrespective of who made the offer, or what, if anything, caused the delay in rejecting the offer of compromise. Independent of all this documentary evidence and who made the offer for Guyton Mitchell -- or whether or not any reason existed for the government's delay in rejecting it -- the limitation statute was tolled during the pendency of the offer and for one year after its rejection. Obviously, therefore, all the evidence complained of was irrelevant and unrelated to the issue being tried. Since we rule that the taxpayer is denied the benefit of the limitation statute from the filing of his offer of compromise until one year after its rejection, there is no need for considering the numerous authorities cited by counsel holding that he would be estopped to benefit by delays which he caused. Each of these grounds shows cause for reversal.</div><div class="casepar">The foregoing rulings require a reversal, hence no ruling is necessary on the ground alleging newly discovered evidence since a new trial will be granted. The other grounds are expressly waived.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Frank O. Evans, U. S. Attorney, W. Howard Fowler, Assistant U. S.
