Leathers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../642/72/index.html">115 Ga. App. 352 (154 SE2d 694)</a></span>, having been reversed on certiorari, Elliott v. Leathers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../150/87/index.html">223 Ga. 497 (156 SE2d 440)</a></span>, is vacated and the case is now considered on the merits.</div><div class="casepar">This is an appeal arising from the case of the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta v. 84.814 Acres of Land, and Camps, Inc., et al., in the Superior Court of Fulton County.</div><div class="casepar">On September 9, 1960, the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta filed its petition to condemn a tract of land located in Fulton County containing in excess of eighty-three acres. Assessors duly appointed divided the tract into several parcels of improved and unimproved land, the unimproved land being referred to as Parcel No. 5, which parcel was itself divided in to two parcels designated as "South Fifty-Three Acres" and "North Thirty Acres." The division of the tract was duly approved by the court.</div><div class="casepar">The awards were duly paid into court and, there being no Controversy over ownership of the parcels of improved property, the awards for such parcels were duly paid to such owners.</div><div class="casepar">To the unimproved land the condemnor determined that there were over five hundred claimants or possible claimants. Over one hundred persons filed a formal or informal claim of some nature to a lot or lots of varying size located within the condemned tract.</div><div class="casepar">On December 6, 1960, the case was referred to an auditor, who conducted numerous hearings and filed with the court on July 3, 1963, his report and findings, accompanied by the evidence adduced before him. Exceptions to the auditor's report and findings were filed and the case came on for hearing before the Honorable Durwood T. Pye, Judge, on January 10, 1966.</div><div class="casepar">This appeal deals solely with two tracts of land located in the "North Thirty Acres" of Parcel No. Five as the condemned tract was divided. Ownership of this land was contested between E. S. Elliott and H. F. Leathers, Sr. For the sake of clarity, we will identify the two tracts of land here involved as the Jessye Mac Watts tract and the Louie E. Watts tract. Jessye Mac Watts and Louie E. Watts are sister and brother, and their original ownership of the lands involved is not in dispute on this appeal.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court entered orders which (1) overruled all exceptions filed by E. S. Elliott to the auditor's report, (2) denied all claims of Elliott to any title in the condemned properties, and (3) denied all claims of Elliott to the proceeds paid into court by the condemnor except for a sum which represented taxes paid by him for certain years preceding the condemnation. From these orders Elliott filed this appeal.</div><div class="casepar">1. Elliott's claim to ownership of the land here involved is by virtue of three tax deeds made pursuant to levies for delinquent taxes. Leathers' claim to ownership is based upon conveyances by quitclaim and warranty deeds from the owners.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court found that the levies and tax deeds under which Elliott claims title were void for lack of adequate description of the land levied upon and sold, and that no title passed thereby. These findings are enumerated as error.</div><div class="casepar">We limit our attention, insofar as adequacy of description is concerned, to the descriptions contained in the levies. "Where a levy on land is void for lack of proper description, the defect can not he cured by a proper description of the land in the deed made by the sheriff in pursuance of the sale had under said levy, for the reason that the deed would not conform to the levy." Burson v. Shields, <span class="casemissing">160 Ga. 723 (2) (129 SE 22)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">A description in a levy must plainly describe the property seized. Code Ann.  39-103. And where there is a levy on land, it must describe the land "with that degree of precision necessary to inform the purchaser of what he is buying and sufficient to enable the officer selling it to place the purchaser in possession, otherwise it is void and a deed based thereon is likewise void." Head v. Lee, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 191</span>, 198 (<span class="casemissing">45 SE2d 666</span>); Harden v. Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/35/index.html">212 Ga. 711 (1) (95 SE2d 375)</a></span>; Burson v. Shields, <span class="casemissing">160 Ga. 723 (1)</span>, supra. A description not complete within itself will not fail where it contains a key by the use of which the description may be supplied by extrinsic evidence. Blumberg v. Nathan, <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 64 (8 SE2d 374)</span>. But an imperfect or ambiguous description is not to be confounded with a description utterly lacking in definiteness. A levy or a deed which fails to describe any particular land or to furnish any key to the confines of the land purporting to be levied on or to be conveyed is void. Mull v. Allen, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 176</span>, 178 (<span class="casemissing">42 SE2d 360</span>); Conyers v. West, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/81/index.html">210 Ga. 190 (78 SE2d 422)</a></span>; Donaldson v. Nichols, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../149/73/index.html">223 Ga. 206 (154 SE2d 201)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The first of the levies with which we are concerned relates to "Jessie" Watts and certain property described therein levied upon for City of Atlanta taxes for the year 1954. The property described in this levy is as follows: "A certain lot in the City of Atlanta in Tax District ________ Land Lot 259 in the 17 District of Fulton County, Georgia, fronting 572 feet on the North LLL side of 259 LL Street, between Field Rd. and Northwest Dr. Streets and running back 1525 feet, more or less, in a South direction, the house on said Lot known as No. ________ on said street according to street numbers, the same being Vac property in the City of Atlanta, Georgia, adjoining Watts."</div><div class="casepar">After a public sale at which Elliott was the successful bidder, Elliott received a deed from the Municipal Revenue Collector Ex-Officio Marshal of the City of Atlanta. This deed was executed July 3, 1956.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence before the trial court that the distance along the north land-lot line of Land Lot 259 between Field Road and Northwest Drive was greatly in excess of 572 ft., being approximately 2,000 ft. The description of the frontage and depth is insufficient to locate the property for the reason that no beginning point is described and the depth is merely "more or less." The fact that the property was also described as "Vac" adds nothing to the description in this instance as the evidence shows that all the property within Land Lot 259 fronting on the north and cast land-lot lines was vacant.</div><div class="casepar">Rewis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/70/index.html">212 Ga. 800 (90 SE2d 257)</a></span>. See also Bruce v. Strickland, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 520 (3) (40 SE2d 386)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. The second levy relates to "Mrs. Jesse" Watts and certain property described therein levied upon for State of Georgia and Fulton County taxes for the year 1951. The property described in this levy is as follows: "A certain lot in Land lot 259 in the 17th District of Fulton County, Georgia, fronting 1525 feet in N. E. corner of Land Lot 572 feet, more or less, in a North East Corner direction. Lot known as Number Vacant Street Land Lot according to the present system of numbering, the same being Vacant property adjoining L. E. Watts."</div><div class="casepar">At a public sale, the B-X Corporation was the successful bidder and received a sheriff's deed executed August 7, 1956. The B-X Corporation later executed a quitclaim deed of all its interest in the property to Elliott. Elliott claims that the property described in this levy is the same property described in the levy discussed in division 1 above.</div><div class="casepar">One is unable to determine from the description whether the 1525 ft. dimension runs along the north line or the east line of the land lot. Furthermore "1525 feet in N. E. corner of Land Lot 572 feet, more or less, in a North East Corner direction" describes nothing geometrical unless one wishes to indulge in a great deal of speculation. "Being vacant property adjoining L. E. Watts" in no wise acts to clarify such vagueness.</div><div class="casepar">In addition, the evidence before the trial court indicates that during no time with which we are concerned have any of the members of the Watts family or the Watts family as a whole owned any property in the northeast corner of Land Lot 259. The deeds introduced in evidence to show the extent of the Watts family property before being partitioned show that the property extended from the northwest corner of Land Lot 259 along the north land-lot line for a distance of 2,640 feet. The court may take judicial notice of the size of land lots (Head v. Lee, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 191</span>, 195, supra), and notes that the north land-lot line of Land Lot 259 has a length of 2,970 feet. Therefore, no property was owned by this family or its members in the northeast corner of the land lot, but rather their property began 330 feet from the northeast corner. The trial court did not err in finding this levy void for lack of legal description. See Livingston v. Livingston, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../187/20/index.html">210 Ga. 607 (82 SE2d 1)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. The third levy relates to L. E. Watts and certain property described therein levied upon for City of Atlanta taxes for the year 1954. The property described in this levy is as follows: "A certain lot in the City of Atlanta in Tax District ________ Land Lot 259 in the 17 district of Fulton County, Georgia fronting 259 in the 17 District of Fulton County, Georgia, fronting 572 feet on the North LLL of 259 LL, between Field Rd. and Northwest Drive and running back 1,525 feet, more or less, in a south direction, the house on said Lot known as No. ________ on said street according to street numbers, the same being Vac property in the City of Atlanta, Georgia adjoining Pruitt."</div><div class="casepar">After a public sale at which Elliott was the successful bidder, Elliott received a deed from the Municipal Revenue Collector Ex-Officio Marshal of the City of Atlanta. This deed as executed July 3. 1956.</div><div class="casepar">It will be noted that the description in this levy is identical with the discretion in the levy discussed in Division 1 above with the exception that here the property is described as "adjoining Pruitt." Here, too, there is no definite beginning point described between Field Road and Northwest Drive. And the fact that the property is described as "vacant" does not and the description for the same reasons discussed in Division 1.</div><div class="casepar">As for the key "adjoining Pruitt" it has been held that merely using a name in such manner without further identifying it as the name of a street or the name of a particular person is an insufficient key for the location of land through extrinsic evidence. Conyers v. West, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/81/index.html">210 Ga. 190</a></span>, supra. The trial court did not err in finding the levy void for lack of description. Rogers v. Manning, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 771</span>, supra; Smith v. Ga. Industrial Realty Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/62/index.html">215 Ga. 431</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">4. The trial court also found all the levies previously discussed void for excessiveness of levy. It ruled in addition assuming them to be valid, that the levies and the deeds subsequently executed represented no title to the respective properties for the reason that the rights of redemption had not been foreclosed nor had seven years expired from the date of sale to the date the condemnation proceeding was instituted. These rulings were enumerated as error.</div><div class="casepar">Having found the levies void for lack of description, it is unnecessary that the court pass upon the additional rulings of the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Felton, C. J., and Pannell, J., concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Hatcher, Meyerson, Oxford &amp; Irvin, Henry M.
