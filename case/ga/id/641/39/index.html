(a) A provision in a deed executed by a railroad company to a municipality, conveying an easement across the railroad tracks for street purposes, reciting that the municipality shall assume "the entire cost of" crossing-protection devices, does not relieve the railroad from whatever responsibility it may have to erect and maintain the devices; it simply obligates the municipality to pay for the devices when the railroad has installed them.</div><div class="casepar">(b) It is error to sustain a renewed special demurrer after amendment curing the defect complained of.</div><div class="casepar">(c) A special demurrer must be perfect in itself. and if any part of it is bad, the entire demurrer is bad.

The petition seeks recovery for the concurrent negligence of the two railroads and alleges substantially as follows.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff's decedent was operating his automobile in an easterly direction on Industrial Boulevard not more than 75 feet behind a car being operated by Brown. When the Brown car reached the Industrial Boulevard crossing it slowed and then proceeded across the two switch tracks and the two main-line tracks, with plaintiff's decedent still following not more than 75 feet behind. At the same time the Georgian was traveling north toward the crossing at a speed of 55 m.p.h. Both defendants had placed railroad cars on their switch tracks to the south of the crossing which obstructed decedent's view to such an extent that he was unable to see the train approaching from that direction until he was already on the tracks of the approaching train, when the collision occurred.</div><div class="casepar">It was further alleged that the obstruction to view created a special hazard so that the defendants should have maintained a mechanical signal device or watchman to warn traffic of approaching trains; that neither of the defendants maintained any mechanical signal device or watchman at the crossing; and that the whistle on the Georgian was not blown at any point within 400 yards of the crossing, nor was the bell rung. Specifications of negligence as to Western &amp; Atlantic are: failure to ring the bell of the train in violation of a city ordinance; failure to blow the whistle in violation of Code Ann.  94-506; failure of its engineer to exercise due care in approaching the crossing as required by Code Ann.  94-506; operation of the train at a speed of 55 m. p. h. in violation of a city ordinance; failure to maintain safety signals, safety lights or watchmen at the crossing in violation of a city ordinance; and failure to keep the train under such control as was necessary to stop the train at the crossing, in violation of a city ordinance. Allegations of negligence on the part of Southern are failure to maintain safety signals, safety lights or watchmen at the crossing in violation of a city ordinance; negligence in placing its cars On the siding just south of the crossing where it knew or should have known that these would block the view of persons entering the crossing from the west of trains of either defendant approaching the crossing from the south; and failure to maintain a mechanical signal device or watchman under such circumstances, constituting a hazard to persons so entering upon the crossing. Both defendants are charged with negligence in maintaining the obstructions to view on the southwest side of the crossing and the failure, under these circumstances, to maintain a mechanical signal device or watchman to warn motorists of trains approaching from the south.</div><div class="casepar">Western &amp; Atlantic appeals from all order overruling its general demurrer, and plaintiff appeals from an order sustaining the general demurrer of Southern. Errors are enumerated on various other rulings on the pleadings.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal of Western &amp; Atlantic was originally to the Supreme Court on the grounds that that court had jurisdiction by virtue of a constitutional attack made upon certain city ordinances pleaded and relied upon by plaintiff, an issue which falls within the jurisdiction of this court. Shipman v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../185/74/index.html">210 Ga. 174 (78 SE2d 515)</a></span>; Beard v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../182/02/index.html">211 Ga. 25 (2) (83 SE2d 594)</a></span>. Consequently the Supreme Court transferred both cases to this court. Western &amp; Atlantic R. Co. v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../151/37/index.html">223 Ga. 622 (157 SE2d 457)</a></span>. Since the judgments appealed from were entered June 15, 1967, the provisions of the Civil Practice Act have no application. Aber- crombie v. Ledbetter-Johnson Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../639/86/index.html">116 Ga. App. 376</a></span>, 378 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../639/86/index.html">157 SE2d 493</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">1. (a) Both defendants contend in support of their general demurrers that the allegations of the petition, being construed against the pleader, show that the sole proximate cause of the collision and death of plaintiff's husband was his failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety. This contention is not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">We note first of all some confusion on the part of defendants in regard to the physical layout of the scene as alleged in the petition. The petition alleges that decedent was crossing from west to east and that the obstructions caused by defendant's railroad cars on their switch tracks occurred on the southwest side of the crossing so as to block the view, from the standpoint of persons crossing from the west, of trains approaching from the south. Hence arguments of the defendants based upon the assumption that decedent was crossing from east to west, or that the switch tracks upon which the cars were located were on the east side of the crossing, are not well taken.</div><div class="casepar">This case is here on demurrer, and we must take the allegations of the petition as being true. We can not add facts not alleged. The petition alleges that both defendants placed railroad cars on their respective switch tracks on the southwest side of the crossing which obstructed decedent's view as he approached the crossing from the west so that he could not see trains of either defendant approaching from the south until he was upon the track of the approaching train. This is all allegation of all ultimate fact, and we can not say as a matter of law demurrer that decedent could have seen the approaching train and stopped short of the main-line track in time to avoid the collision. Callaway v. Pickard, <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. App. 637 (23 SE2d 564)</span>; Reed v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. App. 550 (4) (140 SE 921)</span> a cursory reading of Moore v. Seaboard A. L. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 466 (118 SE 471)</span>, Coleman v. Western &amp; A. R., <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 343 (172 SE 577)</span>, with the special concurrence, dissent, and supplementary opinion on notion for rehearing, and Peeples v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">37 Ga. App. 87 (139 SE 85)</span>, cited by defendants, will reveal that they are of no aid to them or this point under the allegations of this petition.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Southern further contends in support of its general demurrer that the negligence alleged against it was not the proximate cause of the collision, arguing that the superseding or intervening independent negligent acts of Western &amp; Atlantic must be taken in law as the sole proximate cause. No cases are cited, however, for the proposition that negligence of one defend ant in maintaining an obstruction to view can not concur with the negligence of another defendant operating the injury-inflicting vehicle which was obscured from the view of plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">In Seaboard A. L. R. v. Blackshear, <span class="casemissing">11 Ga. App. 579 (75 SE 902)</span>, it was alleged that the defendant railroad was negligent in storing cars upon one of its sidetracks so as to obstruct plaintiff's view and prevent him from seeing an approaching train until he had crossed the sidetrack and was just getting upon the main track when the train was observed a short distance away approaching with great speed. In holding that a general demurrer was properly overruled, the court stated (Headnote 1a): "While a railway company has generally the right to place and store cars upon its sidetracks, it is a jury question whether the storing of cars upon a particular sidetrack, under stated circumstances, is negligence as related to one whose injury may have been caused or contributed to by the improper or untimely placing of such cars." It was further held that an instruction to the jury that " 'where a car is left on a sidetrack, whether that is negligence is a question for the jury, under all the circumstances of the case' " was not error.</div><div class="casepar">This case is clear authority for the proposition that the maintaining of cars on sidetracks so as to obstruct the view of persons entering the crossing may be considered by the jury as a separate act of negligence contributing to the injury although other acts of negligence might be alleged in regard to the speed of the train, failure to signal and to provide flagmen, etc. We do not regard it as material in the case sub judice that the colliding train was under the control of Western &amp; Atlantic, while in Blackshear the train appeared to be that of the defendant causing the obstruction to view, particularly, since in this case it is alleged that both railroads maintained view-obscuring cars on their respective switch tracks at the crossing through both which railroads operated their trains without providing for warning devices, thus creating a dangerous situation.</div><div class="casepar">If there could be any question on the "superseding negligence" point, however, it is answered by Williams v. Grier, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 327 (26 SE2d 698)</span> and Reliable Transfer Co. v. May, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 613 (29 SE2d 187)</span>. In Williams v. Grier plaintiff was injured in a collision between her automobile which was proceeding east on one street and another automobile proceeding north on the intersecting street which was being operated at a very high rate of speed in violation of law. The suit was not against the driver or owner of the speeding automobile, however, but solely against other persons responsible for parking a truck at the intersection in such a manner as to obscure the view of drivers entering the intersection. On appeal to this court it was held that the petition was subject to the demurrer of the defendants obstructing the view at the intersection because there appeared a new and independent cause, intervening between the alleged original wrong and the injury; and the intervening agency was held to be the direct and proximate cause of the injury, and the negligence in obstructing the view too remote. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the petition stated a cause of action based either upon negligence in violation of an ordinance or common law negligence; that the negligence of the defendants in obstructing the view was a contributing or concurrent cause; that the defendants should have anticipated or foreseen that some such injury might occur as a result of their negligence; and that this conclusion stood even though it should appear that the operator of the other automobile was violating a criminal statute as to speed. Hence a cause of action was stated against the view-obstructing defendant, even though the driver of the speeding automobile was not joined as a party defendant.</div><div class="casepar">Reliable Transfer Co. v. May, supra, also involved an intersection collision, and one of the causes of the collision was alleged to be the negligence of one of the defendants in parking its truck in such a way as partially to obscure the view of drivers entering the intersection. Following Williams v. Grier, supra, this court held that a cause of action was set forth on the theory that the negligence of all parties defendant, including the view-obscuring defendant, combined to produce the proximate cause of the injury. See also Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Ellis, <span class="casemissing">54 Ga. App. 783 (189 SE 559)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">We must conclude, therefore, that we cannot say as a matter of law on demurrer that the sole proximate cause of the decedent's death was his failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety or the independent and superseding negligence of Western &amp; Atlantic in the operation of its train. Accordingly there was no error in overruling the general demurrer of Western &amp; Atlantic, but it was error to sustain the general demurrer of Southern.</div><div class="casepar">2. (a) Western &amp; Atlantic contends that the trial court erred in overruling its special demurrers 3, 4, and 5 to Subparagraphs (d) and (f) of Paragraph 24 of the petition. These subparagraphs charge Western &amp; Atlantic with violations of a city ordinance as follows: "It shall be unlawful to operate a train in the city at a greater speed than twenty (20) miles per hour, and a train must be kept under such control as to be capable of being stopped at any public street crossing in said city." Subparagraph (d) alleges violation of the ordinance in operating the train at a speed of 55 miles per hour; Subparagraph (f) alleges a violation in failing to keep the train under such control as to be capable of stopping the trail at the crossing. The demurrers attack the ordinance on the grounds that it is unreasonable and arbitrary, in conflict with the general laws of Georgia, and unconstitutional as depriving demurrant of due process of law. Each of the demurrers is directed to Subparagraphs (d) and (f), thus attacking the allegations of negligence regarding ability to stop at each crossing and the allegations with reference to exceeding the twenty-mile per hour speed limit. In this court, however, an attack is made only upon the allegation of violation of that portion of the ordinance relating to stopping at crossings, the contention being that this portions invalid but severable from the other portion; and no argument is directed to Subparagraph (f) it being concealed that "speed limitation is a proper subject of municipal regulation." We must, therefore, by virtue of this abandonment and concession, treat Subparagraph (f) as not being subject to the special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">There was no error in overruling Western &amp; Atlantic's demurrers 3, 4, and 5.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Plaintiff complains of the sustaining of ground 1 of the renewed demurrer, and motion to purge, of Western &amp; Atlantic to a portion of the fourth paragraph of the petition as amended. This paragraph recites that the action was brought by the widow for her own benefit and for the benefit of the three children of plaintiff and decedent, giving names and ages, "as authorized by section 105-1302 of the Code of Georgia, Annotated subject to Georgia Law of descents as to personal property descending to the widow and children from the deceased, as provided in section 105-1304 of the Code of Georgia, Annotated." The grounds of the demurrer are that the allegations with respect to the children are immaterial, irrelevant, prejudicial and are set out solely for the purpose of obtaining sympathy.</div><div class="casepar">This demurrer was properly sustained. While it is true that under Code  105-1304 the widow holds the amount she recovers subject to the law of descents as if it were personal property descending to the widow and children from the deceased, "[Code  105-1302] gives a right of action to the children only in the event there is no widow. If there be a widow, the right to sue is vested in her and not in the children, or jointly in her and the children. Section 105-1304 appears to be nothing more than a provision stating the purposes for which the widow shall hold the amount she recovers. . . In our opinion the latter section can not be construed, standing alone or in connection with  105-1302, to vest in the children, jointly with the widow or separately, the right to sue for the recovery of damages for the death of their father so long as the widow survives." Bloodworth v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">191 Ga. 193</span>, 195 (<span class="casemissing">11 SE2d 658</span>). Accord: Odom v. Atlanta &amp; W. P. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 477 (51 SE2d 466)</span>. "In [a wrongful death] action the plaintiff [widow] is not called upon to prove the number of her children and their and her dependency upon the deceased for a support, either in establishing her right to recover or in the assessment of damages. It was therefore error for the court to allow, over timely objection, evidence that the decedent had a family of four children, that the family had no other means of support except by his labor, and that the decedent provided a comfortable support for them. Such evidence could only have a harmful effect on the defendant, and was improperly allowed." Central of Ga. R. Co. v. Prior, <span class="casemissing">142 Ga. 536</span>, 537 (<span class="casemissing">83 SE 117</span>). Cf. Macon, Dublin &amp; Savannah R. Co. v. Musgrove, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 647</span>, 648 (<span class="casemissing">89 SE 767</span>); Central R. v. Moore, <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. 151</span>, 152. See also Underwood v.

(a) Western &amp; Atlantic contends that the trial court erred in sustaining plaintiff's demurrers Nos. 1 and 8 to portions of Paragraphs 12 and 24, and Exhibit A of its answer. Exhibit A is a deed executed by Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company (lessee of Western &amp; Atlantic) and Western &amp; Atlantic conveying an easement across the tracks to the City of Dalton for the purposes of the crossing in question. The paragraphs demurred to set up that provisions in this easement release Western &amp; Atlantic from responsibility for erecting and maintaining flasher signals or watchmen at the crossing.</div><div class="casepar">In our view of the case it is not necessary to decide whether Western &amp; Atlantic could, by agreement with the city, contract away any duty it may have had to decedent, under statute or otherwise, to maintain crossing-protection devices, but only to decide the effect of the provision of the lease relied upon, to wit: "Grantee, its successors or assigns . . . shall assume the entire cost of . . . any flasher device or other crossing protection, except as at present otherwise required by statute." It is obvious that the city undertakes only the cost of the devices and does not assume responsibility for the erection or maintenance. This conclusion, if not obvious enough, is bolstered by other portions of the lease which provide that the city "shall install and be responsible for . . . drainage structures. . ."</div><div class="casepar">(b) Western &amp; Atlantic also contends that the trial court committed error in sustaining plaintiff's demurrer 2(b) to a portion of Paragraph 12 of its answer, wherein it was alleged that "there was erected a sign clearly indicating a railroad crossing and said sign was located on both the east and west sides of this crossing." The demurrer complained that it was not alleged that the sign was erected and located in compliance with the provisions of state law. After the demurrer was sustained Western &amp; Atlantic amended its answer to meet the criticism urged by alleging that the sign was erected as provided by law. Upon renewal of plaintiff's demurrers, the court again sustained this ground of demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">Western &amp; Atlantic having amended its answer to meet the only criticism urged, it was error to sustain the renewed demurrer after amendment.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Plaintiff complains of the overruling of special demurrer 9 to the following italicized portion of Paragraph 25 of Western &amp; Atlantic's answer: "for further answer this defendant says that it was operating its train in a legal and lawful manner in that as it approached the crossing it had its lights brightly burning and gave the signals as required by law by blowing the whistle two long and one short and one long blasts; that the bells on said locomotive were ringing; and said employees on said engine were maintaining a constant and vigilant lookout ahead." The grounds of the demurrer are, inter alia, that the underlined allegations constitute an erroneous conclusion of law and facts. Whether or not the allegation may be an erroneous conclusion of law for reasons urged, it does not appear on the face of the paragraph that it is an erroneous conclusion of fact, the facts upon which the conclusion is based being set out. Hence the demurrer is deficient and was properly overruled. See cases cited in Division 2 (a), supra.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Grounds 2(a) and 2(c) of plaintiff's demurrer complain that an allegation in Western &amp; Atlantic's answer, to the effect that crossing signs were maintained, is immaterial, irrelevant, and not defensive to the action. Whatever may have been the duty of Western &amp; Atlantic in regard to warning devices, we cannot say that the allegation has no bearing on the defense of decedent's failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety, which was set up in the answer. Accordingly, there was no error in overruling these demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">(e) The court below, having sustained the general demurrer of Southern, understandably did not rule upon plaintiff's demurrers to its answer; and this court, although having reversed the sustaining of Southern's general demurrer to the petition, cannot undertake, as an original proposition, to pass upon plaintiff's demurrers to Southern's answer.</div><div class="casepar">Likewise, the court refrained from ruling on any of the special demurrers which Southern filed to the petition. When these are ruled upon they may raise other questions or bring material amendments to the petition placing it in a different light when measured by a renewed general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">Judgments reversed in part; affirmed in part.
