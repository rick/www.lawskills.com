The parties agree that Lusk attached the affidavit of a medical doctor to her complaint and that thereafter the action was dismissed on the ground that the affidavit failed to satisfy the requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Lusk then filed the instant action in August 1991, attaching the affidavit of a pharmacist. Harrell and the other defendants (hereinafter "Harrell") moved to dismiss on the ground that Lusk's action constituted a professional malpractice action to which OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> was applicable and that Lusk was barred by OCGA  9-1 1-9.1 (f) from renewing her malpractice action. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that pharmacy is not among those professions delineated in Gillis v. Goodgame, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/4/index.html">262 Ga. 117 (414 SE2d 197) (1992)</a></span> and thus OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> was not applicable. On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Harrell v. Lusk, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/90/index.html">208 Ga. App. 358 (430 SE2d 653) (1993)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In Gillis, supra, this Court, in determining the professions that come within the ambit of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span>, looked not only to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2) (which defines "profession" by setting forth 16 specific professions), but also OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) (defining "professional service") and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span> (providing that licensed professionals are subject to regulation by state examining boards). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) provides that a professional service is that "which may be legally performed only pursuant to a license from a state examining board pursuant to Title 43." (Emphasis supplied.) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span> speaks in terms of "[a]ny person licensed by a state examining board" (emphasis supplied) and cross-references Title 14, Chapters 7 and 10, as containing the Code sections setting forth the professions and professional services subject to regulation.</div><div class="casepar">It is apparent from the interplay between OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span> that the Gillis Court sought to limit the application of the affidavit requirement in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> to those professions which can legally be performed only when a state examining board has determined that the applicant has successfully completed the schooling or training statutorily required to qualify him to practice that profession. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> By applying OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> only to those licensed professions where the state examining board's issuance of the license is conditioned upon an applicant's successful completion of schooling and/or training, we do nothing more than acknowledge that these certain professions require specialized knowledge and the mastery of certain skills. Because the basis of legal liability in a professional malpractice case is whether a defendant exercised a reasonable degree of skill and care, as determined by the degree of skill and care ordinarily employed by respective professionals under similar conditions and like surroundings, Kneip v. Southern Engineering Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/5/index.html">260 Ga. 409 (2) (395 SE2d 809) (1990)</a></span>, and because this matter involves highly specialized expert knowledge with respect to which lay persons can have no knowledge at all, see Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding v. Wilson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../353/75/index.html">197 Ga. App. 354 (1) (398 SE2d 385) (1990)</a></span>, only those individuals possessing like expertise, obtained through commensurate education or training, are competent to testify as to whether a professional defendant complied with or deviated from the applicable standard of professional conduct, an expertise requirement that applies to the OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> affidavit, see Chandler v. Koenig, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../334/98/index.html">203 Ga. App. 684 (417 SE2d 715) (1992)</a></span>, to motions for summary judgment, see Gen. Hosps. of Humana v. Bentley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../400/61/index.html">184 Ga. App. 489 (361 SE2d 718) (1987)</a></span>, and to trial testimony. See Sandford v. Howard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../485/66/index.html">161 Ga. App. 495 (4) (288 SE2d 739) (1982)</a></span>. Accord Howard v. Walker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../926/5/index.html">242 Ga. 406</a></span>, 408 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../926/5/index.html">249 SE2d 45</a></span>) (1978). Therefore, we hold that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> applies only to those licensed professions regulated by state examining boards where licensure is predicated upon the successful completion of the specialized schooling or training necessary to obtain the expertise to practice that profession.</div><div class="casepar">Pharmacy has been legislatively defined as a profession. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/26/4/2/index.html">26-4-2</a></span>. The practice of pharmacy is regulated by the State Board of Pharmacy, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/26/4/37/index.html">26-4-37</a></span>, and an applicant is entitled to receive a license to practice pharmacy only upon compliance with the requirements in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/26/4/72/index.html">26-4-72</a></span>, including graduating from a recognized school or college of pharmacy and successfully passing an examination administered by the State Board of Pharmacy. An extensive review of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated reveals that pharmacy, with its education-qualified licensing and state examining board regulation, is the only profession declared to be such by the legislature that is not included in Title 43. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> As the legislature itself recognized when it enacted the Fair Business Practices Act, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/10/1/391/index.html">10-1-391</a></span> et seq., and provided, among the powers of the administrator, the authority to revoke professional licenses, our Code defines a "person holding a professional license" as including not only Title 43 but also Chapter 4 of Title 26, i.e., pharmacists. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/10/1/395/index.html">10-1-395</a></span> (f).</div><div class="casepar">We therefore find it necessary to augment the list of professions set forth in Gillis, supra, with those persons holding a professional license pursuant to Chapter 4 of Title 26. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Because a suit that calls into question the conduct of a professional pharmacist in his area of expertise is a suit brought against a defendant who provides a service which can be legally performed only pursuant to a license from a state examining board issued upon successful completion of specialized schooling and/or training, we hold that the requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> must be met. Accord Sparks v. Kroger Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../342/46/index.html">200 Ga. App. 135 (407 SE2d 105) (1991)</a></span>. See also Faser v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 674 F2d 856 (11th Cir. 1982).</div><div class="casepar">However, although ordinarily this Court would rule that Lusk's second complaint, filed with the affidavit of a licensed pharmacist, should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (f), that result would be unfair in this case. As in Lutz v. Foran, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../351/2/index.html">262 Ga. 819 (4) (427 SE2d 248) (1993)</a></span>, this is an instance in which it was unclear at the time Lusk filed her initial suit in 1990 whether OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> applied to claims of malpractice against pharmacists. Thus, it would be manifestly unfair to apply OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (f) to the case at bar. Accord Lutz, supra. Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err by affirming the trial court's denial of Harrell's motion to dismiss Lusk's suit.</div><div class="casepar">CARLEY, Justice, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant-defendant is a pharmacist who allegedly committed a negligent act or omission in filling appellee-plaintiff's prescription. Appellee's original suit against appellant was dismissed for appellee's failure to comply with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). After the statute of limitation had run, appellee brought the instant renewal action against appellant. Appellant moved to dismiss pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (f). Relying upon Gillis v. Goodgame, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/4/index.html">262 Ga. 117 (414 SE2d 197) (1992)</a></span>, the trial court denied appellant's motion, holding that appellee's suit against appellant was not an "action for damages alleging professional malpractice" within the meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). The Court of Appeals granted an interlocutory appeal and affirmed, concluding that, under Gillis, it was "constrained to hold that pharmacy is not a profession to which the affidavit requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> [(a)] apply." Harrell v. Lusk, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/90/index.html">208 Ga. App. 358</a></span>, 360 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/90/index.html">430 SE2d 653</a></span>) (1993). This Court granted a writ of certiorari and the majority concludes that appellee's suit is within the scope of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). The majority bases its holding upon the existence of certain statutory provisions in Chapter 4 of Title 26 relating to the practice of pharmacy. I concur in the majority's holding that appellee's suit is within the scope of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). I do not, however, agree with the majority's rationale for that holding.</div><div class="casepar">At the outset, it is important to recognize that the law of this state mandates that the plaintiff produce expert testimony at two different stages of a "professional malpractice" action. The common law has long imposed an evidentiary requirement for the production of expert testimony during the post-pleading stage, whereby the plaintiff will ordinarily be compelled to "establish the standard of care applicable to [the] defendant by the introduction of expert opinion evidence. [Cits.]" Covil v. Robert &amp;c. Assoc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/98/index.html">112 Ga. App. 163</a></span>, 167 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/98/index.html">144 SE2d 450</a></span>) (1965). More recently, the General Assembly has imposed an additional requirement for the submission of expert testimony at the initial pleading stage, whereby the plaintiff must file, along with the complaint, an expert's affidavit setting "forth specifically at least one negligent act or omission claimed to exist and the factual basis for each such claim." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). In a series of cases, the appellate courts of this state have attempted to define the scope of the applicability of the statutory pleading requirement of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). See Housing Auth. of Savannah v. Greene, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../442/6/index.html">259 Ga. 435 (383 SE2d 867) (1989)</a></span>; Kneip v. Southern Engineering Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../404/5/index.html">260 Ga. 409 (395 SE2d 809) (1990)</a></span>; Gillis v. Goodgame, supra. In Gillis, supra at 118, it was held that</div><div class="casepar">the legislature intended for the term "professional" as used in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> [(a)] to be defined by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2); and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span>. We hold, therefore, that the affidavit requirements of [OCGA]  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> [(a)] apply only to those professions recognized under Georgia law in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2); and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span>.

Thus, insofar as the applicability of the common law evidentiary requirement is concerned, a suit by appellee against appellant would certainly be an "action for damages alleging professional malpractice," wherein appellee would ordinarily be required to produce expert testimony to establish the standard of care from which she alleges that appellant deviated.

In specifying its scope, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) does not merely employ the term "professional." Instead, it employs the phrase "any action for damages alleging professional malpractice." Accordingly, the issue for resolution is not whether "the General Assembly enacted OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> [(a)] ' "with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law [regarding a statutory definition of the term 'professional'] and with reference to it. . . ." ' [Cits.]" Gillis v. Goodgame, supra at 118. Instead, the issue for resolution is the legislative intent in establishing the submission of an expert's affidavit as an initial pleading requirement in "any action for damages alleging professional malpractice."</div><div class="casepar">There is certainly a presumption that the General Assembly enacted OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) " 'with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it . . . .'

However, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) relates to the specific topic of practice and procedure in "professional malpractice" actions and, although the three statutes cited in Gillis may define the term "professional" for certain purposes, none of those statutes relates to the specific topic of "professional malpractice" actions. On the other hand, the common law evidentiary requirement specifically applicable in "professional malpractice" actions long antedates enactment of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). In my opinion, it is "with full knowledge" of that specific antecedent common law legal principle, and not "with reference" to the non-germane provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) or <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span>, that the General Assembly established the statutory pleading requirement of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a). Thus, the legislative intent of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a), as I perceive it, was not to limit the applicability of the initial pleading requirement to only malpractice actions brought against those defendants who are engaged in the "professions" enumerated in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span>. Rather, the legislative intent of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) was to create an initial pleading requirement, the applicability of which would be as broad as the antecedent common law evidentiary requirement. The common law having already previously defined "an action for damages alleging professional malpractice" for purposes of imposing an evidentiary requirement that expert testimony be produced at the summary judgment or trial stage, the General Assembly understandably adopted that existing definition for purposes of imposing the statutory pleading requirement that an expert's affidavit be submitted along with the complaint. The rationale for making the scope of cases subject to the statutory pleading requirement as broad as the ambit of cases wherein the common law evidentiary requirement is applicable is apparent. If the plaintiff who would ordinarily be required to produce expert testimony on summary judgment or at trial cannot even produce an expert's affidavit at the initial pleading stage, the defendant should not be put to any additional time and expense in defending himself against the claims of his negligent professional conduct. I simply cannot agree that the General Assembly intended that those defendants who engage in "professions" other than those enumerated in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/7/2/index.html">14-7-2</a></span> (2); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/14/10/2/index.html">14-10-2</a></span> (2) or <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/1/24/index.html">43-1-24</a></span> are to be denied the benefit of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> and, despite the lack of any expert's affidavit to support the plaintiff's complaint, are nevertheless to be put to additional time and expense in defending themselves against the otherwise unsupported claims of their negligent professional conduct.</div><div class="casepar">The majority perpetuates what I perceive to be the error in Gillis, insofar as it accepts the premise of Gillis that the scope of the applicability of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) is somehow dependent upon a statutory definition of the term "professional." Having discovered another statute which was not enumerated in Gillis, but which does define a "pharmacist" as a "professional," the majority now "find[s] it necessary to augment the list of professions set forth in Gillis, supra, with those persons holding a professional license pursuant to Chapter 4 of Title 26." Majority at p. 897. I cannot join in the majority's rationale of "augmenting" Gillis' list of various statutes which define the term "professional" for various and sundry reasons. By its express terms, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (a) applies to "any action for damages alleging professional malpractice. . . ." That phrase already has a common law definition which needed no judicial reinterpretation in Gillis and which needs no further judicial "augmentation" in the instant case or in any future cases.</div><div class="casepar">Where the failure to do a thing, or the negligent doing of it, is proved by reliance upon a general standard of care or by rules of procedure used by others competently performing the same service, it is a "professional" act or practice.

In the case wherein such allegations are made, resolution of the issue of the defendant's compliance with or deviation from the applicable standard of professional conduct calls for "highly specialized expert knowledge with respect to which a layman can have no knowledge at all, and the court and jury must be dependent on expert evidence."

It is only this Court which is authorized to reexamine Gillis and to rectify any error in its holding. The majority would recognize that Gillis was erroneous, but only to the extent that it overlooked certain provisions found in Chapter 4 of Title 26 relating to the practice of pharmacy. I would go further and overrule Gillis on the basis that its very premise was erroneous. Without regard to any statutory definition of the term "professional" which may have been in existence at the time that suit was originally filed against appellant, appellee would have been required, under this state's common law, to produce at the post-pleading stage an expert's testimony to establish the standard of care from which she alleged that appellant deviated.

Since she did not, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (f) would ordinarily bar her instant renewal action. However, I agree with the majority that a strict adherence to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9.1/index.html">9-11-9.1</a></span> (f) would, under the circumstances, be manifestly unfair to appellee.
