Cobb Superior Court. Before Judge Flournoy.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Along with Antonio Lowery, Inez Ottis and her brother Rudolph Ottis, the grand jury indicted Robert Floyd for the malice murders of seven-year-old Britney Ikharia and fifteen-year-old Bridgett Lee. The victims were the daughters of Barbara Jenkins. Ms. Jenkins and Ms. Ottis were mutually involved in the drug trade but, before the murders, their relationship ended acrimoniously. The State's theory was that the four indictees went to Ms. Jenkins's apartment to steal her drugs and money, and committed the murders because the children knew Ms. Ottis and could identify her. In his post-arrest statement, Floyd admitted that he stole a car and drove with the other three to Ms. Jenkins's residence, but he denied that he left the automobile or participated in the homicides. Mr. Lowery pled guilty and offered to testify for the State. Thereafter, a jury convicted Ms. Ottis and her brother of both murders. On appeal, this Court affirmed their convictions and life sentences. Ottis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../757/index.html">271 Ga. 200 (517 SE2d 525) (1999)</a></span>; Ottis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../122/0/index.html">269 Ga. 151 (496 SE2d 264) (1998)</a></span>. The jury found Floyd guilty of the murder of Bridgett, but not guilty of the murder of Britney. After the State withdrew notice of its intent to seek the death penalty, the trial court entered its judgment of conviction on the jury's verdict and sentenced Floyd to life imprisonment. Floyd moved unsuccessfully for a new trial, and now he brings this appeal. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. Mr. Lowery testified against Floyd, and directly implicated him in the fatal stabbing of Bridgett. Floyd contends that the testimony was uncorroborated and, thus, insufficient to authorize his conviction for the murder. Corroboration "may consist entirely of circumstantial evidence, and evidence of the defendant's conduct before and after the crime was committed may give rise to an inference that the defendant participated in the crime. [Cit.]" Klinect v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../133/4/index.html">269 Ga. 570</a></span>, 572 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../133/4/index.html">501 SE2d 810</a></span>) (1998). Also, the accused's own statement can serve to corroborate his accomplice's inculpatory testimony. Wisenbaker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../441/6/index.html">259 Ga. 416</a></span>, 417 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../441/6/index.html">383 SE2d 132</a></span>) (1989).</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Lowery's testimony implicating Floyd in the criminal conspiracy was corroborated by Floyd's post-arrest statement, wherein he admitted supplying a stolen vehicle and driving with the others to Ms. Jenkins's apartment to obtain drugs. See Parkerson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../238/4/index.html">265 Ga. 438</a></span>, 439 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../238/4/index.html">457 SE2d 667</a></span>) (1995). Floyd's claim that, after arriving at the apartment, he did not participate in the murders is inconsistent with his subsequent actions. A witness who had no connection with commission of the murders would be expected to inform the authorities of the identity of the actual perpetrators. See Ottis v. State, 269 Ga., supra at 155 (3). Floyd did not do so. Indeed, the evidence is that he attempted to conceal his own involvement, and even wrote to Mr. Lowery to encourage him not to tell the truth about the homicides. "A defendant's attempts to conceal his participation in an offense can corroborate his accomplice's testimony regarding his participation. [Cits.]" Drake v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../842/4/index.html">245 Ga. 798</a></span>, 803 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../842/4/index.html">267 SE2d 237</a></span>) (1980), overruled on other grounds, Harwell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../114/6/index.html">270 Ga. 765</a></span>, 770 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../114/6/index.html">512 SE2d 892</a></span>) (1999).</div><div class="casepar">The jury generally determines the weight of the corroborating evidence, and even slight evidence of corroboration connecting the accused to a crime is legally sufficient. Edmond v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../180/3/index.html">267 Ga. 285</a></span>, 287 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../180/3/index.html">476 SE2d 731</a></span>) (1996). That standard was met here. See Klinect v. State, supra at 572 (1). Thus, when construed most strongly in support of the verdict, the evidence was sufficient to authorize a rational trier of fact to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Floyd was guilty of the malice murder of Bridgett. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). See also Ottis v. State, 271 Ga., supra at 200 (1); Ottis v. State, 269 Ga., supra at 153 (1).</div><div class="casepar">2. On voir dire, Floyd moved unsuccessfully to strike for cause Dahil Goss because she was employed as a federal prosecutor. In Beam v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../418/0/index.html">260 Ga. 784</a></span>, 786 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../418/0/index.html">400 SE2d 327</a></span>) (1991), we held that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a motion to excuse for cause a prospective juror who "was an employee of the same district attorney who prosecuted the appellant . . . ." That holding is inapplicable here, however, since Ms. Goss is employed by a different prosecuting authority than that which was pursuing the case against Floyd. There is no "appearance of impropriety" where the prospective juror has no connection to the district attorney or solicitor who is conducting the prosecution at issue. Carr v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../188/8/index.html">267 Ga. 547</a></span>, 553 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../188/8/index.html">480 SE2d 583</a></span>) (1997). See also Roberts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../385/0/index.html">261 Ga. 813 (1) (411 SE2d 496) (1992)</a></span>; Jackson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../336/29/index.html">202 Ga. App. 223 (414 SE2d 262) (1991)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Floyd also relies upon Hutcheson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../783/7/index.html">246 Ga. 13 (1) (268 SE2d 643) (1980)</a></span>, "[b]ut we have refused to extend the automatic disqualification rule in Hutcheson to those less connected with law enforcement than full-time police officers. [Cits.]" Mosher v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../159/5/index.html">268 Ga. 555</a></span>, 557 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../159/5/index.html">491 SE2d 348</a></span>) (1997). Compare TerreIl v. State, <span class="casemissing">271 Ga. 782 (523 SE2d 294) (1999)</span>. Unlike a police officer, a prosecuting attorney is an officer of the court. In that capacity, Ms. Goss had a duty to seek justice, not merely to obtain convictions. Carr v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../191/9/index.html">267 Ga. 701</a></span>, 712 (10) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../191/9/index.html">482 SE2d 314</a></span>) (1997), overruled on other grounds, Clark v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../686/index.html">271 Ga. 6</a></span>, 10 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../686/index.html">515 SE2d 155</a></span>) (1999). A review of her voir dire shows that she was well aware of her obligation in this regard and that she affirmed her impartiality as between Floyd and the State. Because the record shows that Ms. Goss had no compelling bias or interest in the outcome of the case which would disqualify her as a matter of law, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to strike her for cause. Garland v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../305/0/index.html">263 Ga. 495</a></span>, 497 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../305/0/index.html">435 SE2d 431</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">3. Although two African-American women were seated on the jury, Floyd made a Batson motion because the State used peremptory strikes to excuse three others. The prosecutor provided reasons for exercising the strikes. The trial court found those explanations to be sufficiently race-neutral, and denied the Batson motion. On appeal, Floyd urges that his motion was meritorious because the State's reasons were a pretext for racial discrimination in the selection of the jury.</div><div class="casepar">All three of the prospective jurors expressed reservations about the death penalty. Their opposition to capital punishment was a neutral and case-related reason for employing the peremptory strikes, since the State did not withdraw its notice to seek imposition of that sentence until after the jury returned its guilty verdict. Although the prospective jurors' conscientious aversion to the death penalty was not sufficient to require an excusal for cause, it was a valid, nonpretextual reason to justify the State's use of a peremptory strike to remove them. Tharpe v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../322/3/index.html">262 Ga. 110</a></span>, 112 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../322/3/index.html">416 SE2d 78</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">The State used a strike against one of the three for the additional reason that she had a close family member who had been prosecuted for selling drugs. "The criminal history of a prospective juror's family is a sufficiently neutral reason to justify a peremptory strike. [Cits.]" Jenkins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../125/3/index.html">269 Ga. 282</a></span>, 290 (11) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../125/3/index.html">498 SE2d 502</a></span>) (1998). Yet another expressed doubts about the credibility of drug users, which was of some concern to the State because several of its witnesses had involvement with drugs. "A reasonable suspicion about a prospective juror's impartiality that falls short of justifying an excusal for cause might well justify the exercise of a peremptory strike." Hall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../383/8/index.html">261 Ga. 778</a></span>, 780 (2) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../383/8/index.html">415 SE2d 158</a></span>) (1991).</div><div class="casepar">To prevail on his Batson challenge, Floyd "had the burden of proving that the State engaged in purposeful discrimination in the exercise of its peremptory strikes." Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../789/index.html">271 Ga. 323</a></span>, 324 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../789/index.html">519 SE2d 232</a></span>) (1999). The trial court's finding that Floyd failed to satisfy his burden of proof is entitled to great deference and will be accepted unless clearly erroneous. Roundtree v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../108/5/index.html">270 Ga. 504</a></span>, 507 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../108/5/index.html">511 SE2d 190</a></span>) (1999). When that standard is applied to the trial court's ruling in this case, we must uphold the denial of the Batson motion.</div><div class="casepar">4. Floyd asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence numerous photographs of the victims and a videotape of the murder scene. Generally, pre-autopsy photographs are admissible to illustrate the nature and extent of a murder victim's wounds and the location of the body at the crime scene. Hayes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../165/9/index.html">268 Ga. 809</a></span>, 812 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../165/9/index.html">493 SE2d 169</a></span>) (1997); Crozier v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../317/5/index.html">263 Ga. 866</a></span>, 867 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../317/5/index.html">440 SE2d 635</a></span>) (1994). Here, the numerous photographs were material, relevant and admissible for these purposes, even if they were to some extent duplicative. Jackson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../108/3/index.html">270 Ga. 494</a></span>, 498 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../108/3/index.html">512 SE2d 241</a></span>) (1999). The videotape also "was relevant and admissible, even though it duplicated still photographs. [Cit.]" Jackson v. State, supra at 498 (8). The evidence is similar, if not identical, to that properly admitted at the trial of Ms. Ottis, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that the photographs and tape were admissible against Floyd. See Ottis v. State, 269 Ga., supra at 156 (4).</div><div class="casepar">5. Over Floyd's hearsay objection, the trial court allowed a prosecution witness to testify to a statement made by Mr. Ottis concerning the crime. This issue is controlled by our holding in Ottis v. State, 269 Ga., supra at 154 (3) that the testimony is admissible as a declaration made by one conspirator against a co-conspirator during the course of the conspiracy.</div><div class="casepar">6. Floyd enumerates as error the trial court's failure to charge the jury that it was authorized to consider a witness's prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence. See Gibbons v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../751/8/index.html">248 Ga. 858 (286 SE2d 717) (1982)</a></span>. The record shows that, although he requested a charge on impeachment, he did not submit a written request to instruct the jury on the correlative principle that prior inconsistent statements constitute substantive, as well as impeaching, evidence. "In the absence of a written request for such a charge, it is not error for the trial judge to fail to charge the jury on the issue of conflicting statements made by a witness." State v. Stonaker, <span class="casecite"><a href="../108/57/index.html">236 Ga. 1</a></span>, 3 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../108/57/index.html">222 SE2d 354</a></span>) (1976). Moreover, a failure to charge on the Gibbons principle constitutes harmless error, "as '(a)bsent instructions to the contrary, the jury surely regarded substantively all the evidence presented to it. (Cit.)' [Cit.]" (Emphasis in original.) Caldwell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../306/6/index.html">263 Ga. 560</a></span>, 564 (11) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../306/6/index.html">436 SE2d 488</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">7. Floyd contends that the verdicts are inconsistent, because the evidence showed that he was guilty of both murders or not guilty of either. In Milam v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../577/3/index.html">255 Ga. 560</a></span>, 562 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../577/3/index.html">341 SE2d 216</a></span>) (1986), this Court abolished the inconsistent-verdict rule in criminal cases. Here, as in Smashum v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../361/7/index.html">261 Ga. 248</a></span>, 249 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../361/7/index.html">403 SE2d 797</a></span>) (1991), "[w]e decline to overrule Milam, and find no merit to this enumeration."</div><div class="casepar">Patrick H.
