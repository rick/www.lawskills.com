At the outset, we reject Sacandy's argument that the superior court judges are not authorized to appoint counsel.

Sacandy argues that she should not be required to participate in the Program because she has no experience nor interest in criminal defense. She thus raises the difficult issue of the competence required of lawyers appointed under an indigent defense program.

This is not to suggest that extended experience in criminal matters is a prerequisite for competence in all criminal cases. Certainly lawyers without such experience are competent to handle some criminal matters in their entirety, and to assist in others. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Also, lawyers may take steps to become more competent in criminal defense, and, in light of the current crisis in indigent defense, we applaud local bar efforts to assist in broadening the availability of competent defense counsel through "mentoring," and other programs. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> However, we reject Sacandy's argument that lack of interest in criminal matters equates to incompetence, or otherwise excludes a lawyer from participation in the Program.</div><div class="casepar">There is no evidence of the retention of incompetent counsel under the Program.

	    Notes

      Local governing committees, as defined in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/12/37/index.html">17-12-37</a></span> (b) may elect to provide indigent defense services through a public defender system, panel of private lawyers, a legal aid and defender society, a contract system or a combination of the foregoing to provide adequate legal defense for indigents accused of felonies or misdemeanors. Guidelines  2.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Whether limiting the panel to lawyers with less than 15 years experience conflicts with the Guidelines is not an issue here. The Guidelines provide, however, at  2.4, that where the local committee elects, as here, to provide indigent defense services through a panel attorney program, appointment of attorneys and the assignment of cases should be made as follows:(a) Appointments of private attorneys shall be made on an impartial and equitable basis;(b) The cases shall be distributed among the attorneys to ensure balanced workloads through a rotation system;(c) More difficult or complex cases shall be assigned to attorneys with sufficient levels of experience and competence to afford adequate representation;(d) Less experienced attorneys should be assigned cases which are within their capabilities, but should be given the opportunity to expand their experience under supervision;(e) Cases in which the death penalty is sought shall be assigned only to attorneys of sufficient experience, skill and competence to render effective assistance of counsel to defendants in such cases. . .See also Uniform Superior Court Rule 29.8.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      Although the injunctive aspect of this appeal may be moot, we choose to reach the merits in light of the significant public interest in this challenge to the validity of an indigent defense program. See generally 5 AmJur2d 210, Appeal and Error,  768. There is no question that the overwhelming need for constitutionally mandated indigent defense has presented a crisis in Georgia and throughout the country. See "Metro Lawyers Volunteer to Handle Indigent Cases," The Atlanta Constitution, January 10, 1992; "Strengthen Indigent Defense," editorial, The Atlanta Constitution, January 21, 1992; "Volunteers or Not, Tennessee Lawyers Help Poor," New York Times, January 17, 1992 ("With the court docket clogged, the public defender's office swamped, and the state's treasury depleted, every lawyer in the county [Knox] has been ordered to represent the poor at no charge."); Drecksel, The Crisis In Indigent Defense, 44 Ark. L. Rev. 363, 408 (1991).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/12/44/index.html">17-12-44</a></span> provides:This article expressly recognizes the inherent power of the court to appoint counsel to represent indigent defendants and to order compensation and reimbursement from county funds in individual cases as the proper administration of justice may require.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
      It makes no difference that the only appointed lawyers not to receive compensation are those who have not handled criminal defense matters or believe themselves unprepared to do so, and that those lawyers serve as co-counsel rather than sole defense counsel, since they</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      Thus, we are relieved from entering the intense debate over whether the imposition on lawyers of an enforceable obligation to perform criminal defense services, or any other legal services, violates the equal protection and due process provisions of our state and federal constitutions, as well as the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude, or is otherwise immoral or imprudent. See generally Comment, Constitutional Challenge to Court Appointments: Increasing Recognition Of An Unfair Burden, 44 S.W.L.J. 1229 (1990); State ex rel. Stephan v. Smith, 747 P2d 816, 837-842 (Kan. 1987); Shapiro, The Enigma of the Lawyer's Duty to Serve, 55 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 735 (1980).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      See also Georgia State Bar Rule 8-104 (D) regarding the requirements for participation in litigation for all attorneys admitted to practice after January 1, 1988. Those attorneys may not appear as sole or lead counsel in the superior or state courts of this state in any contested civil case or in the trial of a criminal case until after the attorney has obtained nine "litigation experiences," as set forth in the rule.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note8" href="#source8">8</a></span>&nbsp;
      Rome's program makes an attempt to insure competence by its provision that lawyers inexperienced in criminal work serve as appointed, uncompensated co-counsel. We understand the circuit's intent to broaden the availability of competent counsel. However, as noted above, counsel may not be appointed in any capacity without adequate compensation.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      In certain cases, such as death penalty cases, it would be permissible, as well as prudent, for a trial judge to appoint inexperienced counsel (who would be competent to assist in some aspects of the defense) in addition to experienced counsel, to represent an indigent defendant. This would be particularly appropriate in death penalty cases. See Davis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../360/6/index.html">261 Ga. 221</a></span>, 223, n. 2 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../360/6/index.html">403 SE2d 800</a></span>) (1991) (Hunt, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;
