Before Judge Flake.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Tradebank International, Inc. ("TII") owns a system of reciprocal brokerage of goods and services, i.e., barter and trade, among its clients and acts as the keeper of records for the transactions between its clients for which it receives compensation. Tradebank International Franchising Corporation ("TIFC") is the wholly owned subsidiary of TII. TIFC acts to franchise TII's regional operations and has granted several franchises with exclusive territories.</div><div class="casepar">On June 23, 1995, Ricardo J. Zampatti ("Zampatti") entered into a franchise agreement with TIFC; the franchise was known as Tradebank Atlanta North. Previously, he had been under a regional management agreement with TII and was reluctant to enter into the franchise agreement with TIFC but did so. The original exclusive franchise territory was: Bartow, Cherokee, Dawson, Forsyth, and Pickens Counties and those portions of Fulton County within Zip Codes 30075, 30076, 30136, and 30201. Zampatti was to facilitate the reciprocal brokerage of goods and services, i.e., barter, among TII's clients.</div><div class="casepar">On March 1, 1996, Zampatti was terminated by written notice as a franchisee; however, Zampatti told TII's clients that both TII and TIFC were going out of business and that he was starting a successor company to take over TII's and TIFC's business to serve them.</div><div class="casepar">TIFC and TII sued Zampatti in a five count complaint: Count 1 for breach of a noncompete and nonsolicitation agreement with TIFC; Count 2 for tortious interference with contract with TIFC's and TII's clients; Count 3 for open account with TII; Count 4 in the alternative for quantum meruit with TII; and Count 5 for OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/13/6/11/index.html">13-6-11</a></span> attorney fees for bad faith, stubborn litigiousness, and unnecessary trouble and expense for TIFC and TII. Zampatti answered and counterclaimed: Count 1 breach of contract in six parts: 1. for failure to pay commissions; 2. for failure to provide franchisee support; 3. for violation of unspecified State and Federal laws and regulations; 4. for breach of contract to clients; 5. for failure to file with the IRS and the Georgia Department of Revenue; 6. for improper accounting; Count 2 breach of fiduciary duty; Count 3 fraud; and Count 4 deceit.</div><div class="casepar">On September 30, 1997, TII and TIFC moved for summary judgment and request for oral argument. On December 11, 1997, oral argument was held although defense counsel did not appear, but written notice was mailed on October 28, 1997. At the time of oral argument, defense counsel was called, but he denied having received notice. Oral argument proceeded and defense counsel obtained a copy of the transcript and the trial court permitted him to submit a supplemental brief in lieu of oral argument. The supplemental defense brief was filed December 26, 1997. Without an order granting permission to file affidavits after the hearing, Zampatti filed on December 24, 1997, supplemental affidavits of Jennifer Walker and Thomas Walker, and his personal affidavit on January 23, 1998. Upon motion by TII and TIFC, the trial court struck such affidavits as untimely filed.</div><div class="casepar">On January 29, 1998, after TII and TIFC filed motions for summary judgment and prior to the trial court's oral argument on the motion for summary judgment, Zampatti filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, raising many of the same issues as addressed in the pending ruling; however, he never had his motion set down for hearing or had the two motions set to be argued on the same date. In fact, Zampatti did not request in writing oral argument.</div><div class="casepar">On May 19, 1998, the trial court granted partial summary judgment to TII and TIFC as to its claims and as to its motion as to Zampatti's counterclaim and denied summary judgment as to Zampatti's motion for summary judgment. Zampatti filed his notice of appeal.</div><div class="casepar">1. Zampatti's first enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in finding that Zampatti breached the franchise agreement. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">Zampatti's brief in argument, citation to the record, and authorities do not address this enumeration at all. Under Court of Appeals Rule 27 (c) (2), (3) such enumeration is deemed abandoned. However, the Court will address the issue nonetheless, because it is dispositive of other enumerations.</div><div class="casepar">Under the franchise agreement, Zampatti was not to compete with TII or TIFC within his territories or solicit business from the clients for one year following his termination, for any reason. In March 1996, Zampatti formed The Barter Company, Inc. ("BCI"), which performed the same activities that he engaged in while a franchisee. From March 1996 through March 1997, at his former franchise address, Zampatti engaged in the barter business within his former territory and solicited clients of TII and TIFC. During the 12 months in the territory, Zampatti took 27 of TII's former clients and solicited business from another 24 TII clients. Such solicitation of TII's clients by Zampatti caused it financial losses. Thus, there was undisputed evidence that Zampatti breached the franchise agreement.</div><div class="casepar">2. Zampatti's second and third enumerations are that the trial court erred in not considering the timely filed affidavits and in striking the supplemental affidavit testimony of Thomas and Jennifer Walker. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">(a) On March 26, 1996, Thomas and Jennifer Walker signed affidavits to be used in opposition to any injunction; on October 29, 1997, the affidavits were filed. Thomas Walker testified that he had worked from January 1995 until September 1995 as president of TIFC, when he resigned. Jennifer Walker testified that she was Chief Financial Officer of TII from approximately June until August 1995, when she resigned. Both testified that they learned that TII had been: a. "failing or refusing to produce financial statements"; b. "manipulating corporate checking accounts, including floating, 'kiting' and otherwise issuing bad checks; c. "failing to carry proper insurance, including insurance for workers' compensation, liability, and unemployment benefits"; d. "failing to pay or otherwise comply with state and federal tax laws"; and e. "withdrawing funds from the corporation for personal use without documentation or actual expenses, and often in the name of a third party."</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (e) mandates that affidavits "shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in the evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith."</div><div class="casepar">Such general bare allegations. in the affidavits were not stated with specificity as to times, places, party or parties, transactions, occasions, or events so as to constitute statements of facts. Where the affidavits failed to set forth any factual basis for the conclusions and contentions, then they were insufficient to oppose a motion for summary judgment. See Parlato v. MARTA, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../471/08/index.html">165 Ga. App. 758 (302 SE2d 613) (1983)</a></span>. These allegations were made in support of the conclusion that TII or TIFC "were conducting business in a manner contrary to the terms and intent of these franchise agreements" and "[t]his conduct outlined above seriously imperiled the viability, marketability and continued existence of TII, TIFC and the Tradebank system, including each franchisee and member within that system, including Tradebank Atlanta North owned by Ricardo J. Zampatti." As mere conclusions, they cannot oppose a motion for summary judgment. Sullivan v. Fabe, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../351/87/index.html">198 Ga. App. 824 (403 SE2d 208) (1991)</a></span>; Collins v. West Am. Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../394/56/index.html">186 Ga. App. 851 (368 SE2d 772) (1988)</a></span>; Belcher v. Logan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../526/84/index.html">150 Ga. App. 249 (257 SE2d 299) (1979)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Such conclusions are not admissible as the opinion of a layperson, because insufficient facts were stated to lay a proper foundation for a lay opinion. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/65/index.html">24-9-65</a></span>; Johnson v. Knebel, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../194/8/index.html">267 Ga. 853 (485 SE2d 451) (1997)</a></span>. Nor are such conclusions admissible as the opinion of an expert, because neither Jennifer Walker nor Thomas Walker were qualified in the affidavits as expert witnesses through training, skill, or experience to render an expert opinion. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/67/index.html">24-9-67</a></span>; Martin v. Baldwin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/16/index.html">215 Ga. 293 (110 SE2d 344) (1959)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Mere conclusions are insufficient to overcome evidence of necessary certitude; opposing affidavits "must set forth specific facts." Neither affidavit contains material facts and were properly not considered by the trial court. See Love v. Love, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../441/9/index.html">259 Ga. 423 (383 SE2d 329) (1989)</a></span>; Keene v. Herstam, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../266/07/index.html">225 Ga.

App. 737</a></span>, 748 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../634/75/index.html">165 SE2d 441</a></span>) (1968).</div><div class="casepar">Further, Jennifer Walker worked from "approximately June to August of 1995" as Chief Financial Officer, so that she could have only personal knowledge for such limited period of time; however, she does not specify for what time period her allegations a. through e. cover. Anything before June 1995 and during or after August 1995 would be outside her personal knowledge; during and after August 1995, she would have no access to know what she purports to have testified to; thus, application of the affidavit to time prior to and after her employment must be disregarded for her lack of personal knowledge. The same is true for Thomas Walker for the periods prior to January or after September 1995. See Morris-Bancroft Paper Co. v. Coleman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../387/84/index.html">188 Ga. App. 809 (374 SE2d 544) (1988)</a></span>; Summer v. Allison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../605/24/index.html">127 Ga. App. 217 (193 SE2d 177) (1972)</a></span>. Thus, they were incompetent to testify of their own personal knowledge as to times when they were not employed. Watkins Prods. v. England, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../616/82/index.html">123 Ga. App. 179 (180 SE2d 265) (1971)</a></span>; Ireland v. Matthews, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../627/40/index.html">120 Ga. App. 510 (171 SE2d 387) (1969)</a></span>. Where lack of personal knowledge as to some evidence can be shown from the affidavit despite a claim of personal knowledge, such portion of the affidavit shall be disregarded by the trial court. Sullivan v. Fabe, supra at 824; see also Morris-Bancroft Paper Co. v. Coleman, supra at 809.</div><div class="casepar">However, prior to June 1995, as Chief Financial Officer, she would have access to accounts, books, records, files, checks, or statements upon which to base an opinion or hearsay exception; but, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (e) such documents would have to be attached to the affidavits for such opinion to be admissible or as a business record exception to the hearsay rule. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/14/index.html">24-3-14</a></span>; Val Preda Motors v. Nat. Uniform Svc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../361/10/index.html">195 Ga. App. 443 (393 SE2d 728) (1990)</a></span>; Landers v. Ga. Baptist Med.

App. 344 (393 SE2d 700) (1990)</a></span>; Thomasson v. Trust Co. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../531/55/index.html">149 Ga. App. 556 (254 SE2d 881) (1979)</a></span>. Likewise, Thomas Walker would have access to such records prior to January 1995; however, this would not provide personal knowledge. No such documents were attached to the affidavits; therefore, their allegations were excluded either as hearsay, opinions without foundation, or bare allegations, not facts. Pratt v. Tri City Hosp. Auth., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../369/28/index.html">193 Ga. App. 473 (388 SE2d 69) (1989)</a></span>. Thus, the allegations are based on matters not in the record and not admissible in evidence. Nettles v. Laws, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../441/40/index.html">172 Ga. App. 241 (322 SE2d 546) (1984)</a></span>; Davis v. Haupt Bros. Gas Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../594/34/index.html">131 Ga. App. 628 (206 SE2d 598) (1974)</a></span>; Chandler v. Gately, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../630/48/index.html">119 Ga. App. 513 (167 SE2d 697) (1969)</a></span>. As hearsay, such testimony must be excluded. Bonds v. John Wieland Homes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../423/77/index.html">177 Ga. App. 254 (339 SE2d 318) (1985)</a></span>. The trial court did not err in disregarding such inadmissible evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(b) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (c) and Uniform Superior Court Rules 6.2 and 6.3 mandate the time within which the respondent may file evidence in opposition to summary judgment; either within 30 days of service of the motion or on the day prior to the scheduled hearing. Since the movant made a request for oral argument under Rule 6.3, then under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (c) Zampatti had until December 10, 1997, to file any evidence in opposition to the motion. On December 11, 1997, Zampatti knew that the hearing on the motion had taken place; nonetheless, Zampatti, without requesting leave of the court for permission to file late affidavits, filed his own affidavit and supplemental affidavits for the Walkers on December 24, 1997, fourteen days late and three days after his supplemental responsive brief was due.</div><div class="casepar">A motion to strike is the proper procedure to attack untimely filed affidavits.

At the time that Zampatti solicited such clients, he knew that they were TII's clients, because Zampatti had serviced them as a franchisee of TIFC. Such luring away of these clients deprived TII of revenue. Thus, the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">5. Zampatti's sixth enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in finding that TII should recover on its claim for quantum meruit.

He argues that the Tradebank dollar value is substantially less than that of actual currency. Such is a damages issue, because under quantum meruit damages are based upon the value of goods and services, i.e., benefit, to Zampatti and not to TII. Therefore, what Zampatti contends has not been proven and is a disputed issue of fact, i.e., the benefit conferred upon him, is exactly the issue that the trial court correctly left for jury determination.</div><div class="casepar">A party could render substantial services or transfer goods to another that were of little benefit to the defendant; therefore, benefit is measured from the standpoint of the person upon whom such benefits were conferred. A jury must determine what reasonable benefit was, in fact, conferred to determine the recovery, i.e., damages. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/2/7/index.html">9-2-7</a></span> states: "[o]rdinarily, when one renders service or transfers property which is valuable to another, which the latter accepts, a promise is implied to pay the reasonable value thereof."

Zampatti's seventh enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in finding that his counterclaim for breach of contract fails as a matter of law. We deem this enumeration abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">This enumeration fails to cite to the record and suffers from the same defect of the counterclaim in the trial court below, i.e., it neither identifies the contract that was breached, the contract provision breached, nor the party, TII or TIFC, that he alleges breached the contract. Thus, under Court of Appeals Rule 27 (c) (3), this enumeration is deemed abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">7. Zampatti's eighth enumeration of error is that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment as to his counterclaim for fraud and deceit. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">The alleged misrepresentations of material fact that Zampatti contends that he relied upon "tax liens, check kiting, mismanagement, misrepresentations of officers, and no financial reports" were attributed to TII; however, Zampatti in his deposition could not identify any false statement, either orally, contained in any document, or the franchise agreement, that he relied upon to his detriment or identify who made such false statement. Thus, there was a total failure on summary judgment to come forward with some evidence to raise an issue of material fact as to each element of the cause of action after TII and TIFC pierced the pleadings of the counterclaim with their evidence. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (e); Lau's Corp. v.

Zampatti has failed to come forward with evidence that would raise a material issue of fact that either TII or TIFC, or their agents, made specific misrepresentations or concealed material facts with the intent to mislead Zampatti to his detriment. Zampatti deposed that he did not know, i.e., of any misrepresentations or who made them, if made; he stated let an expert answer. Likewise, Zampatti fails to raise an issue of fact that he was misled to his detriment. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">8. Zampatti's ninth enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in not considering his motion for summary judgment and its related supporting materials. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">Divisions 1 through 7 control as to the correctness of the trial court's grant of summary judgment to TII and TIFC on their claims and against Zampatti's counterclaim, which is preclusive of Zampatti's motion for summary judgment on the same or derivative issues that TII and TIFC breached the contract. The trial court ruled on the motions for summary judgment that were first filed, TII's and TIFC's, prior to Zampatti's later filed motion. Zampatti never asked for oral argument or for the motions to be heard or considered together.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court ruled on Zampatti's motion after granting summary judgment to TII and TIFC, finding Zampatti's motion now moot. To find Zampatti's motion moot, the trial court determined that there existed no material issues of fact or law that survived the granting of partial summary judgment on the claims of TII and TIFC and the granting of their motions for summary judgment against Zampatti's counterclaims and that were encompassed in Zampatti's motion for summary judgment. The trial court ruled that the granted summary judgment disposed of all the issues raised in Zampatti's motion and precluded such issues now being raised again, because such issues had been decided adversely to Zampatti.

We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">Zampatti filed affidavits in opposition and a brief in opposition within 30 days of TII's and TIFC's motion for summary judgment. Even if the trial court provided no notice of the oral argument on TII's and TIFC's motions for summary judgment, Zampatti failed to show harm, because the trial court had him orally notified on the day of the hearing on December 11, 1997 and allowed him ten days in which to file his supplemental brief in lieu of oral argument; he obtained a transcript of the oral argument.

Defense counsel did not immediately make a written objection to such procedure nor was an objection made in the supplemental brief. The first time that defense counsel raised a written objection on the record was after the entry of the summary judgment on May 18, 1998 in their motion to reconsider and their personal affidavits filed on June 18, 1998.

Since the true currency value of the barter or trade debt was not a true one to one ratio, despite any contractual terms to the contrary which may not have survived the termination of the agreement, then the reasonable value of the goods and services representing the open account debt in the barter system was a question of fact as to reasonable value, which should be decided as quantum meruit by a jury.
