Before Judge Sosebee.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">George Stewart was convicted of the murder of Felton Goodrum and sentenced to life imprisonment.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence slows that the defendant and his wife Evelyn were separated. Evelyn had met Goodrum about a week before the murder and subsequently had seen him every night. On Friday, May 10, 1974, Goodrum called for Evelyn at her home about 7:30 p.m. aid they went to several clubs. They returned to her home about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday morning. About 3:00 a.m. on that Saturday morning the daughter of the defendant returned to the home and found her father, the defendant, there. He asked her where her mother was and who was with her. When the daughter told him she did not know, the defendant told her that he knew who was with his wife and that he intended to "kill whomever she was with." The defendant's sister-in-law was also in the home and the defendant told her that he was waiting on Goodrum and Evelyn and that he was going to kill him. At 4:00 a.m. when Goodrum and Evelyn arrived, the daughter and sister-in-law ran out to the parking lot, waving and telling them to leave. The defendant followed after them with a gun in his hand and began shooting at the car. The first shot went through the windshield and Evelyn ran from the car, leaving the right front door open. The defendant went to the open door and fired twice more at Goodrum. The car rolled back, hit another car in the parking lot and Goodrum fell out on the ground. Some men who were at the scene put him into the car and took him to the hospital. He was dead when the hospital physician examined him. The cause of his death was three bullet wounds in the face.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant testified at the trial, however, that Goodrum tried to run over him with his automobile and he fired the first shot through the windshield, and that he subsequently fired two shots more at him because he "went in there to get his gun to kill me."</div><div class="casepar">An officer found an unloaded .32 caliber pistol locked inside the car's console next to the victim.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant appeals to this court. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. The appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to give the jury the charge on voluntary manslaughter without a request because the evidence shows a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person. The appellant bases his contention on the fact that his wife had been with Goodrum on the night of the murder and for several previous nights and he viewed them in the car together immediately prior to the murder; that he was distraught over his wife's neglect of the children and the grandchild; that his concern was aggravated by seeing the grandchild unattended on the floor of her residence and that Goodrum attempted to run over him in his automobile, drew a gun on him, and caused him to kill in the heat of passion. Two prosecution witnesses testified that the appellant had said immediately prior to the shooting that he was going to kill Goodrum and left the home with a gun in his hand when he heard the car approaching. The appellant testified that he fired the shots solely to protect himself from the victim because the victim tried to run over him with his car, that he jumped to one side and then shot his gun through the windshield. The state's evidence showed premeditated murder and the defense was justifiable homicide. There is no evidence of provocation sufficient to reduce the intentional homicide to voluntary manslaughter. A charge of justifiable homicide was given by the trial court. Compare Campbell v. State, <span class="casemissing">204 Ga. 399 (49 SE2d 867)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">There is no merit in this contention.</div><div class="casepar">2. The appellant contends that the trial court erred in charging the jury: "The person is justified in using force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only, if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or the commission of a forcible felony. The person is not justified in using force under the circumstances just enumerated, if he initially provokes the use of force against himself with the intent to use such force as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon himself. The court charges you that if you find that the defendant acted in this case in justifiable defense of himself under the principles of the law I have given you in charge, it would be your duty to find the defendant not guilty." (Emphasis supplied.) The appellant contends that the emphasized words should be upon the assailant as is provided in Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1249, 1272 (Code Ann.  26-902 (b, 1)) and that the charge was prejudicial to him. There is no merit in this contention.</div><div class="casepar">We find that the charge as given was an inadvertent misstatement by the trial court and that it was not so confusing or prejudicial to the defendant as to require a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">3. The appellant contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in that charging the jury without request on the law relating to justification of the use of force in defense of members of one's family. The new Criminal Code of 1968 (Ga.L. 1968, p. 1249 et seq.) does not contain a provision relating to justification of the use of force in defense of members of one's family but does contain a provision for justification of the use of force in defense of self or others. Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1249, 1272 (Code Ann.  26-902).</div><div class="casepar">However, there is no evidence in this case which would have required the trial court to charge justification of the use of force in defense of others since the defendant contended he shot the victim to protect himself.</div><div class="casepar">4. The appellant contends that the corpus delicti was not proved because the indictment charged him with the murder of Felton Goodrum but the evidence showed that the victim's real name was Felton Greer.</div><div class="casepar">There is no merit in this contention. The evidence was sufficient to show that the victim used both the names Felton Goodrum and Felton Greer and was known by several witnesses by each name.</div><div class="casepar">Edward E.
