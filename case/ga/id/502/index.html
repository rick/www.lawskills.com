Atkinson Superior Court. Before Judge Perkins.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Defendant Robert Timothy Stanford was convicted of malice murder in connection with the death of Sherry Odums. This appeal follows the denial of Stanford's motion for a new trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. Viewed in a light to uphold the verdict, we find the following: On the night in question, Stanford met Odums, Perry Thomas, and Jerome Nixon at a bar, where they drank beer. Later, they went to a club where they drank a few more beers.</div><div class="casepar">Stanford, Odums and Thomas left the club in Stanford's Camaro. Stanford drove to a wooded area and exited the car. Odums and Thomas exited the car, too.</div><div class="casepar">In Thomas' presence, Stanford gave Odums $20 in exchange for sex; and they engaged in sexual intercourse two times. Then Stanford demanded that Odums perform oral sex. When she refused, Stanford became angry. He took back the $20 and strangled Odums with one hand. As Stanford and Thomas left in Stanford's car, Stanford threatened to kill Thomas if Thomas told anyone what had happened.</div><div class="casepar">Odums' body was left in the woods. It was discovered one or two days later. A mud flap from Stanford's Camaro was found at the crime scene.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence was sufficient to enable any rational trier of fact to find Stanford guilty of malice murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). The trial court did not err in denying Stanford's motion for a new trial on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">2. Stanford, who represented himself at trial, wished to impeach several witnesses by cross-examining them concerning prior inconsistent statements. The statements had been summarized and reduced to written form by interviewers. The State objected, arguing that Stanford could not confine his questions to one portion of the statements without reading the statements in their entirety aloud. The trial court agreed, and instructed Stanford that he would have to read the statements aloud if he wanted to cross-examine the witnesses about their statements. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/24/3/38/index.html">24-3-38</a></span>; but see Brown v. State, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 572 (5) (46 SE 833) (1904)</span>. In some instances, but not in every instance, Stanford balked at the trial court's ruling, stating he did not want to use the whole statements. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> Nevertheless, Stanford read the statements into evidence before cross-examining the witnesses. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Stanford now asserts the trial court erred in requiring him to read the statements aloud because they contained, inter alia, irrelevant and prejudicial matter. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> See Brown v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">Pretermitting whether the trial court erred in requiring Stanford to read the statements out loud, whether Stanford acquiesced in the trial court's ruling, and whether Stanford's argument on appeal was raised below, we find no harm. In view of the testimony of several eyewitnesses that Stanford, Odums and Thomas left the club in Stanford's car, the eyewitness testimony of Thomas with regard to the murder, forensic evidence placing Stanford's car at the scene of the crime and corroborating Thomas' account of the murder, and DNA evidence pointing directly at Stanford, we find the evidence of Stanford's guilt to be overwhelming. It is highly probable that any error in requiring Stanford to read the statements aloud did not contribute to the verdict. Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../798/index.html">271 Ga. 375 (14) (519 SE2d 221) (1999)</a></span>; Laney v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../756/index.html">271 Ga. 194 (8) (515 SE2d 610) (1999)</a></span>; Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../102/43/index.html">238 Ga. 59</a></span>, 61 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../102/43/index.html">230 SE2d 869</a></span>) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">3. Stanford contends the trial court erred in permitting the State to introduce prior act evidence. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">Stanford is approximately one in ten million.</div><div class="casepar">The State introduced evidence of four prior acts: One woman, Stanford's ex-wife, averred that Stanford often beat and choked her when he was drinking; she added that Stanford began to beat her once when she refused to perform oral sex. Another woman testified that Stanford gave her a karate chop to the neck and raped her when she refused his sexual advances. She also testified that on another occasion, Stanford choked her, raped her, anally sodomized her, and tried to force her to perform oral sex. A third woman averred that Stanford demanded that she perform oral sex; that she refused; and that he hit her with his fist. Finally, the State introduced evidence in connection with the death of Judy Rucker, whose body was found in a wooded area in Florida.</div><div class="casepar">The State demonstrated that Stanford and Rucker spent the evening with friends; that Stanford and Rucker went to Rucker's house; that they sat in Stanford's vehicle and talked; that Stanford offered Rucker $20 to engage in sex; that Rucker agreed; and that Stanford and Rucker climbed into the back seat of Stanford's car and began having sexual intercourse. The State also demonstrated that Rucker had convulsions and that Stanford "hit her to bring her around," but was unsuccessful; that Stanford pulled Rucker out of his car and dragged her into the woods; and that he left her there "breathing." Finally, the State demonstrated that Rucker's face was severely bruised.</div><div class="casepar">We find no error in the admission of these prior acts under the standard set forth in Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../377/9/index.html">261 Ga. 640 (2)</a></span> (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../377/9/index.html">409 SE2d 649</a></span>) (1991). It was clearly established that Stanford committed the acts; that they were sufficiently similar to the crime charged as to be probative; and that they showed Stanford's course of conduct and bent of mind in sexual encounters. See Farley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../245/1/index.html">265 Ga. 622 (2) (458 SE2d 643) (1995)</a></span>; Anderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../259/89/index.html">228 Ga. App. 617 (2) (492 SE2d 252) (1997)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. It has long been said that "Georgia does not recognize a declaration against one's penal interest as an exception to the rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay evidence." Turner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../175/8/index.html">267 Ga. 149</a></span>, 154, fn. 3 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../175/8/index.html">476 SE2d 252</a></span>) (1996); Barksdale v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../223/9/index.html">265 Ga. 9</a></span>, 11, fn. 3 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../223/9/index.html">453 SE2d 2</a></span>) (1995); Green v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../920/5/index.html">242 Ga. 261</a></span>, 271 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../920/5/index.html">249 SE2d 1</a></span>) (1978). What that means is that Georgia does not recognize a third party's admission against penal interest, when that admission exculpates the defendant:</div><div class="casepar">Timberlake v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../803/5/index.html">246 Ga. 488</a></span>, 492 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../803/5/index.html">271 SE2d 792</a></span>) (1980); Turner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../294/05/index.html">216 Ga. App. 896</a></span>, 899 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../294/05/index.html">456 SE2d 241</a></span>) (1995). See also Green, Ga. Law of Evidence (5th ed.),  286. But this is not to say that a defendant's declaration against his penal interest is inadmissible. Our courts have often said that a defendant's incriminating statement is admissible when it constitutes an admission against the defendant's penal interest. See, e.g., Hall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../240/27/index.html">235 Ga. App. 44</a></span>, 46 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../240/27/index.html">508 SE2d 703</a></span>) (1998); Howard v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../260/70/index.html">227 Ga. App. 5</a></span>, 7 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../260/70/index.html">488 SE2d 489</a></span>) (1997). That is because a defendant's declaration against penal interest is the admission of a party-opponent. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/24/3/34/index.html">24-3-34</a></span>; Rumsey, Agnor's Ga. Evid. (3rd ed.),  11-13 (defendants' incriminating statements are admissible under the same theory as the exception to the hearsay rule for admissions of a party-opponent).</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the trial court did not err in permitting a police officer to testify as to what Stanford told him in connection with the death of Judy Rucker. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> Stanford's incriminating statement was admissible as an admission against his penal interest, see Howard v. State, supra, because Stanford's statement was the admission of a party-opponent. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/24/3/34/index.html">24-3-34</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">5. Stanford complains that the trial court allowed a police officer to testify regarding the out-of-court statements of two witnesses who never testified at trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> We find no harmful error. The witnesses' statements only indicated when they last saw Stanford, what car he was driving, where he worked, and the fact that Stanford and his wife were separated. Other witnesses testified to substantially the same facts. Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../155/7/index.html">268 Ga. 452 (2) (490 SE2d 381) (1997)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">6. The trial court properly denied Stanford's motion for discharge and acquittal in this capital case because Stanford requested a continuance <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> following the filing of his speedy trial demand. Rice v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../284/6/index.html">264 Ga. 846 (452 SE2d 492) (1995)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. When the State introduced prior act evidence, Stanford requested a contemporaneous limiting instruction. The trial court advised Stanford that it would give such an instruction in its final charge to the jury, which it did. Stanford acquiesced to the trial court's ruling. He did not insist upon a contemporaneous charge; he did not stand his ground; he simply said "Okay." Thus, Stanford cannot complain further. Earnest v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../338/8/index.html">262 Ga. 494</a></span>, 496 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../338/8/index.html">422 SE2d 188</a></span>) (1992); Sanders v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../409/47/index.html">181 Ga. App. 117</a></span>, 120 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../409/47/index.html">351 SE2d 666</a></span>) (1986).</div><div class="casepar">8. Stanford asserts the trial court erred in requiring him to wear a stun belt, and in failing to instruct the jury that the belt had no bearing on Stanford's guilt or innocence. In this regard, he also asserts that his decision to proceed pro se was not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily because the trial court did not inform him that he would be restrained by a stun belt and accompanied by guards. These assertions are without merit. Stanford never interposed an objection to the wearing of the belt. Furthermore, the record does not reflect that the jury could see the belt or that Stanford was prejudiced by it in any way. See Young v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../130/2/index.html">269 Ga. 478 (2) (499 SE2d 60) (1998)</a></span> (use of electronic security measure is permissible where it is shielded from view and defendant is not harmed by its use).</div><div class="casepar">9. Stanford contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant sufficient funds for experts to testify at trial. However, no request for such funds was raised below. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span></div><div class="casepar">10. Stanford's assertion that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence is without merit. Stanford's assertion is predicated on the notion that affidavits used to obtain several search warrants contained information that the affiant knew was false. More particularly, Stanford points out that, although in one affidavit, the affiant averred that Thomas said Stanford killed Odums at the crime scene, in other affidavits, the affiant averred that Thomas said Stanford killed Odums in his car.</div><div class="casepar">This slight discrepancy between the affidavits, which consisted of several pages, does not suggest an intentional or reckless falsehood on the part of the affiant. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Besides, the allegedly false statement was not necessary to a finding of probable cause. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154 (98 SC 2674, 57 LE2d 667) (1978); Williams v. State, <span class="casemissing">251 Ga. 749</span>, 796 (<span class="casemissing">312 SE2d 40</span>) (1983).</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="casenotes"><div class="header">

      Odums was murdered on November 27, or November 28, 1994. The grand jury indicted Stanford on May 22, 1995, and charged him with malice murder. Trial commenced on May 6, 1996, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on May 10, 1996. The trial court sentenced Stanford to life in prison the same day. Stanford's timely filed motion for a new trial was denied on June 11, 1999, and he filed a notice of appeal on July 6, 1999. The appeal was docketed in this Court on July 16, 1999, and submitted for a decision on the briefs on September 6, 1999.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
