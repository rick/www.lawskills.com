A petition alleging that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $225 plus interest at 7% from a date certain and, despite request, fails and refuses to pay the indebtedness, plus a prayer for process and judgment, and showing the jurisdiction of the court, is defective in matter of substance but does contain enough to amend by. An amendment timely offered and setting out the details by reason of which the indebtedness arose was properly allowed by the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">2. In an action for breach of an implied warranty to the effect that the automobile purchased by the plaintiff was reasonably suited to the purpose intended, the evidence supported a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for damages in full amount of the purchase price plus interest.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where there was conflicting evidence as to whether the automobile in question was sold with an express exclusion of all warranties, express and implied, it was error to so instruct the jury as to eliminate this defense from their consideration.</div><div class="casepar">4. Where there was conflicting evidence as to whether the automobile was, even in its defective condition, of some value on the open market, it was error to charge the jury in effect that they could return one of only two verdicts; either for the defendant, or in favor of the plaintiff for the entire purchase price paid. The measure of damages in an action on an implied warranty is the difference between the price paid and the value of the goods as they actually were at the time and place of the sale and delivery.</div><div class="casepar">S. V. Moore filed a petition which, in addition to alleging parties and jurisdiction and the usual prayer for process and judgment, contained only the following: "Defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $225 besides interest there on from February 3, 1958, at 7%. Despite requests for payment the defendant fails and refuses to pay said indebtedness."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant demurred generally and specially. Thereafter the plaintiff twice amended, and each amendment was allowed over the objection that the original petition did not contain enough to amend by. The amendments alleged in substance that the plaintiff delivered to the defendant $225 and a promissory note for $32.50 as the purchase price of a 1952 Ford Tudor automobile purchased on February 3, 1958; that there was no express warranty in connection with said vehicle; that the automobile was entirely unsuited to the use intended as a vehicle because the motor block was so cracked and broken as to render it worthless as an automobile; that this was a latent defect not discoverable in the exercise of ordinary care by the plaintiff until after acceptance of delivery and use by him; that it gave him trouble on the way home the day of purchase, and on the next day he discovered the latent defect therein; that he immediately notified the defendant and requested him to accept redelivery and refund the money paid or else that he place the article in condition for use as an automobile; that the defendant refused and the plaintiff then stored the vehicle for the defendant's account at McCord Motor Company, Macon, Georgia. Counts 2 and 3 are not considered since the verdict was returned on count 1 only. Thereafter the defendant made a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict based on his prior motion for a directed verdict, and also a motion for new trial which was later amended by the addition of five special grounds. The denial of these motions, as well as the rulings on the pleadings, are assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar">1. While it may be readily admitted that the petition as first drawn was subject to demurrer in that it did not meet the requirements of the Code to fully and distinctly set forth a cause of action, nor did it have (as did Bass v. West Point Wholesale Grocery Co., <span class="casemissing">5 Ga. App. 746</span>, 62 S. E. 1004) the aid of any statement of account attached to it as an exhibit, it does not necessarily follow therefrom that there was not enough to amend by. The classic test of what is "enough to amend by" as applied in Ellison v. Georgia R. Co., <span class="casemissing">87 Ga. 691</span> (13 S. E. 809) is recognized by the plaintiff in error, and the question becomes one of application of it to the present case. The petition meets several of the requirements without question--that is, it sufficiently alleges a plaintiff, a defendant, and jurisdiction of the court. Quantitatively it is sufficient, because the original subject matter, with the amendment added, makes a complete cause of action. Qualitatively, however, there must in the first instance be sufficient facts to differentiate the action intended to be declared upon from other possible causes of action "not with full certainty, but with fair probability." In summary (page 714): "The least amount of substance in a declaration which will serve to show that what is offered to be added rightly belongs there is enough to amend by if the addition proposed would make the cause of action complete . . . See that the newcomer would be at home in the pleading and that with it admitted there would be no material absentee, and the question is settled."</div><div class="casepar">The original petition alleges that the defendant is "indebted" to the plaintiff. The word "debt" means generally a specific sum which one owes to another (Chavala Cooperative v. Hortman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../699/25/index.html">93 Ga. App. 505 (3)</a></span>, 92 S. E. 2d 236) and does not embrace liability for tort (Georgia Power Co. v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">43 Ga. App. 791</span>, 792, 160 S. E. 690). The amount of the indebtedness is stated as being $225 and the date from which interest is chargeable against it is stated as February 3, 1958. The case accordingly sounds in contract, on a specific indebtedness. It is true that the origin of the indebtedness is not shown and therein the petition is defective. It might have arisen, as it did, from a breach of warranty; on the other hand, it might have arisen in an open account, a loan of money, or various other ways. It is nevertheless a specific debt identified both by date and amount; the way in which the indebtedness arose is supplied by the amendment, and the two together make a completed cause of action. It was accordingly not error to admit the amendments over objection and thereafter to overrule the general demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence amply sustained the plaintiff's contention that the automobile which he purchased had several large cracks in the motor mounts and cylinder head at that time; that he was unable even to drive it home without great difficulty, and that in the opinion of a motor mechanic it was injured too badly for repair. There was accordingly no error in overruling the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the motion for a new trial on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">3. Code  96-301 provides in part: "If there is no express covenant of warranty, the purchaser must exercise caution in detecting defects; the seller, however, in all cases (unless expressly or from the nature of the transaction excepted) warrants that . . . 2. The article sold is merchantable, and reasonably suited to the use intended." It is contended that the court's instruction as follows: "I charge you that the law of Georgia requires in the absence of an express warranty that the article sold be reasonably suited to the use intended for it" was erroneous in that it excluded from the jury's consideration the defendant's contention, supported by his own evidence, that the vehicle was sold in an "as is" condition with no warranty either express or implied. Where the seller expressly refuses to warrant the article sold there can be no implied warranty. Jones v. Love, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 594 (4)</span> (21 S. E. 2d 254). The court should have stated this principle of law substantially in the language of Code  96-301, since under the evidence in this case the question was involved of whether implied warranties had been excluded by the sales transaction.</div><div class="casepar">4. Code  20-907 provides: "In some cases a party may rescind without the consent of the opposite party, for nonperformance by him of his covenants; but this can be done only when both parties can be restored to the condition in which they were before the contract was made." Code  96-306 provides: "A breach of warranty, express or implied, shall not annul the sale if executed, but shall give the purchaser a right to damages . . . If the sale is executory, such breach is a good reason for the purchaser to refuse to accept possession of the goods." Where the sale is executed and there is a breach of warranty, the measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date of sale. Americus Grocery Co. v. Brackett &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 489</span> (46 S. E. 657).</div><div class="casepar">"Where there is a sale of goods, with a warranty of quality, and a delivery and acceptance by the buyer and the goods prove not to correspond with the warranty and there is no fraud by the seller, the measure of damages is the difference between the price paid and the value of the goods as they actually were at the time and place of the sale and delivery." Clark &amp; Co. v. Neufville, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. 261 (1)</span>. See also Bray &amp; Son v. Southern Iron &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">28 Ga. App. 813</span> (Id) (113 S. E. 55); Hutchinson Lumber Co. v. Dickerson, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 328 (3)</span> (56 S. E. 491). A difficult question is sometimes presented by the issue of whether or not the contract has been executed; if it has, then in the absence of special circumstances such as fraud, Code  96-306 will not apply. Yeomans v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">54 Ga. App. 330 (1)</span> (188 S. E. 62). The question of what may constitute an executory sale is thoroughly discussed in York Ice Machinery Corp. v. Griffith, <span class="casemissing">175 Ga. 441</span> (165 S. E. 209), and Snellgrove v. Dingel- hoef, <span class="casemissing">25 Ga. App. 334</span> (103 S. E. 418), especially in the special concurrence in the latter case. Under these authorities, we find the sale in this case was executed by delivery to and acceptance by the plaintiff of the automobile, and delivery to and acceptance by the defendant of $225 in cash and the purchaser's note for the balance of $32.50. Nothing remained to be done by the seller, and nothing remained to be done by the purchaser except payment of the note when it should fall due. The cause of action, which was a breach of an implied warranty that the automobile was reasonably suited for the purpose intended, permits recovery of the total purchase price paid plus interest only in the event the merchandise is completely worthless. Feagin v. Beasley, <span class="casemissing">23 Ga. 17 (1)</span>. While we are well satisfied that there is ample evidence to this effect, there is nevertheless evidence in the record under which the jury could have found that the automobile could have been repaired and would have had some value, even in its defective condition, to a person willing to purchase and repair it. Special grounds 5, 6, 7 and 8, assign various errors on the court's charge as being on an "all or nothing" basis--that is, the instruction gave the jury no middle ground between finding in favor of the defendant and finding in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount sued for. There being evidence in the record which would have authorized the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff a lesser amount based on the true measure of damages, which was the difference between the contract price and the market price on the day of sale, this error was handful and demands a reversal of the case. International Harvester Co. v. Adams, <span class="casemissing">135 Ga. 104 (6)</span> (68 S.
