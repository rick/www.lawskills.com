J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The petition did not show that the plaintiff was barred from recovery by her own negligence; therefore, the court did not err in overruling the general demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Emma Mae Taylor sued the Southeastern Fair Association for damages allegedly caused by the defendant's neglect. The petition alleged substantially the following: That on the night of October 7, 1955, the defendant was operating the Southeastern Fair in Fulton County; that on its fair grounds the defendant maintained a large concrete structure known as the grandstand in front of which is a lake of several acres and around which lake is a race track used for horse, automobile and other racing events; lying just north of said lake and race track are apparatus and fixtures which the defendant uses in putting on its fireworks and electrical displays for the pleasure and entertainment of its patrons, said display being one of the drawing attractions of the fair; that the defendant operates the fair and amusement park for profit and each person who enters the defendant's grounds pays a certain price for his ticket, the ticket entitling him to the right to enter the pleasure grounds and enjoy the free attractions therein; said grandstand and seats therein are made of concrete, there being some thirty such seats and the grandstand being approximately one hundred and fifty feet long; each seat is about thirty inches wide and is raised above the seat below about twelve inches; all of the seats are made of concrete; at about 3 p.m. on October 7, 1955, the plaintiff went to the said fair grounds with the intention to, and did, stay at the fair grounds until about 10 o'clock at night in order to see the fireworks and electrical display put on by the said fair each night; the plaintiff having purchased a ticket which gave her the right to a seat in the grandstand to view the fireworks; that she entered the said grandstand and obtained a seat near the entrance thereof where she stayed until the electric and fireworks show was over; that at the front of the grandstand are four high poles or towers on two of which are fourteen flood lights each, and on the other two poles are twelve flood lights each, making a total of fifty-two flood lights, being a sufficient number of lights to completely light up the grandstand almost as well as the light of day; that the said lights were ample to make the said grandstand and the approach thereto perfectly safe when lighted up, but that the grandstand was extremely hazardous and dangerous when the said flood lights were not turned on as to petitioner and the other patrons who were compelled to make their exit therefrom in darkness; that all the said fifty-two lights were turned off during the electrical display; that after the display ended, petitioner hesitated a short time before she made any effort to leave the stand, during which time the lights were not turned on; that after waiting a short time, petitioner and her friends started to leave the stand, that it was raining a downpour, as petitioner began to move in the direction of the exit with the greatest of care, it being practically pitch dark as none of the flood lights were turned on at the end of the said fireworks display, thereby leaving petitioner and the other patrons in the grandstand in almost total darkness; that in trying to get from one step to the other in the dark, petitioner missed her step and fell, her fall violently throwing her down onto and between two of the said hard concrete steps, injuring her most severely; that the defendant was negligent in the following particulars: (a) In failing to keep in a reasonably safe condition its said grandstand and the exit therefrom, which said unsafe condition was well known to defendant, or by the exercise of ordinary care should have been for petitioner's use to enter and leave, in violation of the laws of Georgia, the same being negligence per se; (b) In failing to exercise ordinary care to anticipate that because of the facts alleged, its said grandstand and the exit therefrom were thereby unsafe and that petitioner, who had entered its said grandstand, at the invitation of and upon her payment to defendant of the aforesaid entrance charge,</div><div class="casepar">would be likely to suffer injuries because of the said unsafe condition of its grandstand; (c) In failing to turn on the said flood lights at the end of the fireworks display; (d) In failing to exercise ordinary care to properly and reasonably light its said grandstand and the exits therefrom, at the conclusion of its said fireworks display, by turning on its said flood lights, so that the said grandstand and the exits therefrom would be reasonably safe for petitioner to leave; (e) In failing to anticipate the dangerous condition of its large, high, concrete grandstand and seats therein when in darkness, and petitioner's presence therein, which defendant knew or by the exercise of ordinary care should have known, and that petitioner was likely to suffer injuries because of the said darkened, unlighted and unsafe grandstand, after the conclusion of defendant's display of fireworks, and to avoid injury to petitioner thereby.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant's general demurrer to the petition was overruled and it excepts.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant contends that the petition shows on its face that the plaintiff failed to exercise ordinary care for her own safety so as to be barred from recovery. The contention is without merit. The cases relied on by the defendant hold that a person who voluntarily enters a place of darkness and who is injured because of the darkened condition is negligent and is the author of his own misfortune. In the instant case, the plaintiff was not voluntarily entering the darkened grandstand but was seeking to leave the grandstand after the electrical and fireworks display. In the cases relied on by the defendant there was nothing to show that the plaintiffs were acting under any sort of compulsion or absolute necessity. In the instant case, the plaintiff had two alternatives, either doing exactly as she did or remaining in the grandstand in the rain until it somehow became light enough for her to see. The latter course of action might have necessitated her spending the night in the grandstand. Under the circumstances alleged whether the plaintiff was negligent and if so, whether such negligence constituted the proximate cause of her injuries are questions which cannot be determined as a matter of law but which must be resolved by a jury. If the plaintiff acted indiscreetly, the effect of such conduct under the conditions then existing can better be determined by a jury than by the court. Southern Railway Co. v. Crabb, <span class="casemissing">10 Ga. App. 559 (1)</span> (73 S. E. 859).</div><div class="casepar">Since the petition did not show that the plaintiff was guilty of such negligence as would bar her recovery, the court did not err in overruling the general demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
