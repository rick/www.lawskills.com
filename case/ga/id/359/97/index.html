Coffee Superior Court. Before Judge Holton.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Mr. and Mrs. Guthrie appeal the confirmation of sale by power of real property owned by them.</div><div class="casepar">On June 2, 1986, Mr. Guthrie executed a Deed to Secure Debt to The Exchange Bank, securing a debt of $96,184.35. On September 28, 1987, Mr. and Mrs. Guthrie both signed a "Promissory Note, Disclosure Statement and Security Agreement" with Bank South, Douglas.</div><div class="casepar">The body of that document reflects as collateral "Deed to Secure Debt to Bank South, Douglas dated 6/2/86" and describing the subject property.</div><div class="casepar">The property, which included a building which was used as the Rib Shack restaurant, was purchased in 1980 for $125,000. It was purchased by Bank South for $75,000 at the sale conducted pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/14/161/index.html">44-14-161</a></span> in December 1988.</div><div class="casepar">1. The hearing was begun in February 1989, with the Bank relying solely on the testimony of one of its loan officers on the subject of value. After hearing this evidence, the trial court sua sponte continued the hearing to the beginning of April for the bank to get an independent appraisal, which the court wanted for its consideration. The bank had urged that the property significantly lost value since its purchase, due to deterioration. No objection was made to the continuance until the testimony of the appraiser was offered at the April hearing.</div><div class="casepar">The grant or denial of a continuance, even on the court's own motion, is a matter of discretion for the trial court. Patterson v. Lanham, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/69/index.html">182 Ga. App. 343</a></span>, 344 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/69/index.html">355 SE2d 738</a></span>) (1987); MARTA v. Partridge, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/81/index.html">187 Ga. App. 637</a></span>, 638 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/81/index.html">371 SE2d 185</a></span>) (1988) (physical precedent); cf. Village Creations v. Crawfordville Enterprises, <span class="casemissing">232 Ga. 131</span>, 132 (<span class="casemissing">206 SE2d 3</span>) (1974); Simmerson v. Blanks, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/47/index.html">183 Ga. App. 863</a></span>, 864 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/47/index.html">360 SE2d 422</a></span>) (1987). It is too late to object to a continuance after it has been accomplished and the purpose for it has been fulfilled. See Abernethy v. Cates, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/99/index.html">182 Ga. App. 456</a></span>, 460 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/99/index.html">356 SE2d 62</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">The court did not abuse its discretion in providing the relatively short delay so as to be better informed about the value of the property when it issued its order. It was not satisfied with the testimony concerning foreclosure date value which was offered by the bank, and the statute states that "[t]he court shall require evidence to show the true market value. . . ." Appellants claimed no harm at the time they complained of the continuance. While the opposing party's loss of time and the expense of attending two hearings are no small factors to be taken into account when contemplating a continuance, the court has a responsibility to achieve a just result on the merits when possible. The court was aware that there was a significant disparity between several earlier appraisals and the purchase price sought to be confirmed, and the court did not exceed its authority in continuing the hearing for another appraisal. Patterson, supra. This is true even though the court did not condition the continuance on the Bank's payment of the Guthries' costs occasioned by it.</div><div class="casepar">2. Enumerations 4 &amp; 5 deal with the alleged failure of Bank South to prove it was entitled to foreclose pursuant to the Deed to Secure Debt issued by Mr. Guthrie to The Exchange Bank.</div><div class="casepar">Appellants urged that Bank South had failed to prove that the Deed had been assigned to it by The Exchange Bank or that there was any connection between the two.</div><div class="casepar">The Deed contained an "open end" or "dragnet" clause which provided that the deed would also secure any future advances, additional loans or renewals "made or granted by the party of the second part [The Exchange Bank] to or for the party of the first part." Such clauses are limited to debts arising ex contractu between the original parties to the security instrument. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/14/1/index.html">44-14-1</a></span>; Willis v. Rabun County Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../709/8/index.html">249 Ga. 493 (291 SE2d 715) (1982)</a></span>. A merged bank is considered an original party to the security instruments of its constituent banks. They do not lose their existences in the merger, merely their identities. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/14/1/index.html">44-14-1</a></span> (a); Georgia R. Bank &amp;c. Co. v. McCullough, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../955/9/index.html">241 Ga. 456 (246 SE2d 313) (1978)</a></span>. While it is stated in Bank South's brief that it was merged with The Exchange Bank, this does not appear in the record and cannot be considered. Johnson v. Shield Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/78/index.html">189 Ga. App. 333</a></span>, 334 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/78/index.html">375 SE2d 510</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">Appellants, however, failed to comply with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9/index.html">9-11-9</a></span> (a), which requires specific negative averment to raise the issue of the capacity or authority of a party to bring an action. The only allusion to improper capacity or authority was made during closing arguments at the conclusion of the second hearing. Even if this were a proper issue for a confirmation proceeding, this was untimely and the issue was waived. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/81/index.html">9-11-81</a></span>; Adams v. Cato, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../430/14/index.html">175 Ga. App. 28 (332 SE2d 355) (1985)</a></span>; Patterson v. Duron Paints of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../548/31/index.html">144 Ga. App. 123 (1) (240 SE2d 603) (1977)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. Appellants also contend that the foreclosure was improper under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/6/77/index.html">48-6-77</a></span> because additional intangible taxes were not paid on the September 1987 note to Bank South. That section provides that failure to pay the tax "shall constitute a bar to . . . the exercise of any power of sale. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The note to Bank South was not for the advancing of additional funds but rather for the refinancing of the original note, secured by the original deed to secure debt. Assuming, without deciding, that the tax was due on a refinancing pursuant to the original security instrument, the issue is not one which can be resolved in a confirmation proceeding. The power of sale referred to in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/6/77/index.html">48-6-77</a></span> had already been exercised.</div><div class="casepar">"Appellants misperceive the purpose of a confirmation proceeding. 'The primary issue at a hearing for confirmation of a foreclosure sale under power, which is a condition precedent to an action for deficiency judgment, is a judicial ascertainment that the property brought at least its true market value on the foreclosure sale. (Cit.) The court must also pass on "the legality of the notice, advertisement and regularity of the sale." ' Shantha v. West Ga. Nat. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../547/04/index.html">145 Ga. App. 712 (244 SE2d 643)</a></span>. '(T)he court's inquiry should go only to the value of the real estate on the date of sale, in the course of the examination to determine which the fairness of the technical procedures used may be examined, but only for the purpose of making sure that the sale was not chilled and the price was in fact market value.' Walker v. Northeast Production Credit Assn., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../533/45/index.html">148 Ga. App. 121</a></span>, 122 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../533/45/index.html">251 SE2d 92</a></span>). Alleged defenses to the original debt such as the 'novation' asserted here 'are not relevant to the confirmation proceeding, even assuming any of the appellants had a meritorious defense to the prosecution of a deficiency judgment against them. . . . (T)he (confirmation) statute does not undertake to decide controversies between parties as to the amount of the debt, side agreements, or matters in defense of default or in denial of indebtedness, or which might have been the basis of an injunction preventing the foreclosure sale.' Harris &amp; Tilley, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../499/65/index.html">157 Ga.

The first two enumerations are that Bank South failed to prove the property was sold for its true market value and that the testimony of the bank's appraiser should not have been allowed because it was based on speculation and not supported by factual data.</div><div class="casepar">The only objection made to the testimony of the bank's appraiser at the hearing was a motion to strike his testimony after he testified both on direct and cross and the bank had rested its case. The objection was that an insufficient foundation had been laid to show that the comparable sales used for the opinion were in fact comparable. Additional grounds will not be considered. Long v.

App. 88</a></span>, 91 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../499/65/index.html">276 SE2d 137</a></span>) (1981). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/14/161/index.html">44-14-161</a></span> places the responsibility for commencement of the confirmation proceeding upon the "person instituting the foreclosure proceedings." Appellee here was the entity "instituting the foreclosure proceedings" and it is uncontroverted that the advertisement and sale were regular and technically correct. Accordingly, appellants' contention concerning the lack of proof of assignment of the security deed to appellee is not something that can be considered within the confines of this confirmation proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Presiding Judge McMurray joins in this special concurrence.</div><div class="casepar">C.
