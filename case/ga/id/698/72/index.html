Before Judge Humphrey. Jefferson Superior Court. August 16, 1955.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, P. J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial for any of the reasons assigned.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant was indicted on two counts. Count 1 charged assault with intent to murder under the provisions of Code  26-1101. Count 2 charged murder growing out of an alleged abortion. The same transaction was alleged in each count. Before pleading to the merits the defendant made an oral motion in the nature of a general demurrer to count 2 on the ground that while the facts therein alleged might be sufficient to constitute the offense of abortion as defined by Code  26-1102 the facts were not sufficient to charge assault with intent to murder as defined by Code  26-1101. The court overruled this motion. The case proceeded to trial and the defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and was given a sentence of from 4 to 5 years.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence is sordid. We see no good purpose in setting it out in detail here. Suffice it to say that the State submitted evidence to the effect that the deceased was pregnant, and that the defendant admitted that he assisted the deceased woman in bringing about an abortion. The officers, including the Chief of Police of Louisville and the Sheriff of Jefferson County and other officers produced evidence to the effect that on the night the deceased died they visited the home of the defendant and procured from the defendant's bedroom certain instruments and articles used to commit abortions. After these articles were procured, the defendant was taken to jail in Louisville. The next morning the sheriff and his deputy were compelled to go to Swainsboro for the purpose of investigating a number of cases of burglary. The sheriff asked the chief of police to talk with the defendant and see what the defendant said regarding the offense. The chief of police went to the jail at the instance of the sheriff and had a conversation with the defendant. The defendant admitted that he was guilty of the crime charged against him and stated that he had been in the practice of committing abortions for a long time, whereupon the chief of police was instructed by the sheriff to take the defendant to the office of the sheriff to see if the defendant would make any statement concerning the offense. This the chief of police did, and the defendant did make a statement in the presence of the chief of police and a deputy sheriff and others, to the effect that he was guilty of the offense charged and that the statement he was giving and which after being transcribed he later signed, was freely and voluntarily made. After the statement had been made, a notary public was called and the statement of the defendant was witnessed by the notary public, who testified that the statement was read over to the defendant, that the defendant was asked if it was correct, and that the defendant stated that it was correct. The defendant signed the statement. Thereafter, the defendant requested the chief of police to eliminate from the written statement words to the effect that he had committed an abortion on several other women. The chief of police told the defendant that since the defendant had made the statement that it would neither hurt nor help the defendant to have it taken out of the written statement. There was also introduced in evidence, without objection, a wire recording of the defendant's statement which was identical with the defendant's written statement. In addition, the sheriff testified that the defendant told him that he had been committing this crime for a long number of years; that</div><div class="casepar">he learned it from a doctor in Savannah, with whom he had worked and helped in such criminal acts. There was evidence to show that the name of the doctor was given by the defendant but this name does not appear in the record.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed his motion for a new trial on the general grounds and thereafter added ten special grounds.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss count 2 of the indictment. See Holloway v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../705/32/index.html">90 Ga. App. 86</a></span> (82 S. E. 2d 235).</div><div class="casepar">2. There is ample evidence to support the verdict. See Holloway v. State, supra.</div><div class="casepar">3. We will take up the special grounds in their order.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Special ground 1 assigns error because the court refused a written request to charge Code  26-1102. The court did not err in this respect for the reasons that the Code section to which reference is made could only apply where the facts showed that the crime was committed in the performance of a legal act without due caution and circumspection. Code  26-1102 covers a misdemeanor. There is no evidence that the defendant was engaged in the operation of a legal act without due caution and circumspection. The evidence is overwhelming to establish the fact that the defendant was engaged in an unlawful act, covered by Code  26-1101 and that is the verdict found by the jury. In this connection we call attention to Biegun v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../197/08/index.html">206 Ga. 618 (5)</a></span> (58 S. E. 2d 149). In that case the defendant was convicted of murder. The court refused to submit assault with intent to murder and charged Code  26-1102. In the instant case the learned judge properly refused to charge Code  26-1102 and properly charged Code  26-1101 in regard to assault with intent to murder as alleged in count 1 of the indictment. Sullivan v. State, <span class="casemissing">121 Ga. 183 (5)</span> (48 S. E. 949), Barrow v. State, <span class="casemissing">121 Ga. 187 (8)</span> (48 S. E. 950) and Fields v. State, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. App. 287</span> (167 S. E. 337), cited by counsel for the defendant, do not change our view of the situation now before the court. This special ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Special ground 2 assigns error because the court erred in charging Code  26-1101. Our attention is called by counsel for the defendant to Guiffrida v. State, <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. App. 595</span> (7 S. E. 2d 34) and Hunter v. State, <span class="casemissing">29 Ga. App. 366</span> (115 S. E. 277). Of course we are familiar with the facts of the instant case and have read also the decisions cited by counsel and we find that the facts in the cases cited are substantially different from the facts in the instant case. We are of the opinion that the statement of the defendant himself refutes the contentions made by counsel. This ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Special ground 3 assigns error because the court admitted, over objection, testimony of Doctor John Pilcher that the cause of the death of the deceased was "secondary to criminal abortion." The physician made an autopsy on the deceased woman. From knowledge gained thereby and from the examination of the deceased the physician was amply authorized to give his opinion that the abortion was a criminal abortion. The defendant himself in a statement admitted that there had been a criminal abortion but stated that the deceased and not the defendant was responsible for the abortion. It must be kept in mind that the crime charged is the death of the deceased mother and not that of the child. This ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Special grounds 4 and 5 assign error because the court admitted in evidence, over objection, an alleged confession of the defendant, and the failure of the court to instruct the jury that since the State offered the alleged confession in its entirety it would be required to find that each and every part thereof was voluntary. In our statement of facts we have set out the circumstances of the request to delete certain statements of the defendant. The court submitted the alleged confession to the jury. In view of the alleged confession as a whole and in view of the other evidence in the case it is our opinion that the court did not err in admitting the alleged confession or in the failure to give the charge requested. These special grounds are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Special ground 6 assigns error because the court erred in failing to charge that part of Code  26-1006 which defines involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a "lawful act without due caution and circumspection." The evidence shows clearly that the acts committed were unlawful and therefore such a charge was not indicated. The principles of law in Warnack v. State, <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. App. 590 (2)</span> (60 S. E. 288), and Collins v. State, <span class="casemissing">66 Ga. App. 325 (4)</span> (18 S. E. 2d 24), are correct but have no application under the facts of the instant case. This ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(f) Special ground 7 assigns error because the court erred in charging the jury the law of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act. What we have said regarding special ground 6 hereinabove covers the special ground. This ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(g) Special ground 8 assigns error because the court admitted in evidence, over objections, certain articles found in the home of the defendant. All the articles mentioned were such as are used in operations of this type and they were found in the home of the defendant. In view of all the other evidence and the whole record, such admission was not harmful to the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">(h) Special ground 9 assigns error because the court erred in charging the jury that it was not necessary for the State to prove that the defendant acted alone in the case but that if he was present, aiding, and abetting in an abortion which caused the death, then the jury would be authorized to find him guilty. It is alleged that this was harmful and prejudicial to the defendant in that the court failed to instruct the jury as to what would constitute aiding and abetting; that such a charge authorized the jury to convict the defendant by his mere presence when an abortion was being committed, whether or not the defendant had any intent to commit a crime; that such a charge authorized the jury to find the defendant guilty of murder, whether or not express or implied intent was present; that the charge authorized the jury to find the defendant guilty on either count in the indictment, whether or not the alleged abortion was legal or illegal. It is our opinion that the trial court did not go beyond the scope of the evidence and the pleadings in this charge and that the charge is not cause for a reversal for any of the reasons given. This special ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">(i) Special ground 10 alleges that the charge is confusing and misleading and because of such alleged confusing and misleading charge the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The charge of the court as a whole was ample and full and not subject to the criticism relied on in this ground. This ground is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial for any of the reasons assigned.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">W.
