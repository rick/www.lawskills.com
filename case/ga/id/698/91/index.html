Before Judge Pharr. Fulton Superior Court. February 23, 1955.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, C. J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The court did not err in confirming the sale made under a power of sale contained in a deed to secure debt.</div><div class="casepar">Atlanta Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association filed a petition in Fulton Superior Court for the purpose of having one of the judges of said court approve and confirm a sale of real property. The sale was made by the plaintiff as attorney in fact for the defendant in the proceeding, Miss Mary A. Tingle, by virtue of a power of sale contained in a deed to secure debt executed by Miss Tingle and delivered to Mrs. Paul M. Mansfield and, to secure a debt owed by Mrs. Mansfield, duly transferred to the plaintiff, together with the real property therein described and the note secured thereby. The petition alleged that the property was duly advertised and legally sold to Mrs. Paul M. Mansfield for $32,000 and that the power of sale was fairly exercised and that $32,000 represented the fair market value of the property. Miss Mary A. Tingle filed her answer to the rule to show cause why the sale should not be confirmed alleging: that the only bid at the sale was by Mrs. Mansfield; that the sale by the plaintiff was null and void because the property or an interest therein was on the day of the sale in the custody of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas by virtue of the filing in that court of a petition under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act; that on or about March 29, 1954, the defendant conveyed the property described in the petition to L. E. Ingle and Gladys Ingle and executed a bill of sale to the personal property described in the above-mentioned security deed; that on December 6, 1954, L. E. Ingle filed in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas his petition for leave to seek an arrangement under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act, a copy of which was attached to the answer and is herein later substantially shown; that prior to the purported sale under the security deed actual notice of the filing of L. E. Ingle's petition in the bankruptcy court was given to the plaintiff; that the attorney for the plaintiff read aloud at the time and place of sale the letter containing notice of the bankruptcy proceedings. Defendant prayed that the confirmation be denied. L. E. Ingle's petition to the bankruptcy court among other things alleged that he was the equitable owner of the real estate involved and that he had an interest therein other than a right to redeem it from a sale had before the filing of the petition. No proposed arrangement with creditors was filed with the petition, and it alleged that the petitioner was filing with the petition a motion praying that the court grant to him a period of ten days within which to file all other necessary papers required by the Bankruptcy Act. The judge after a full hearing on the issues confirmed the sale, and Miss Mary A. Tingle excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> This case was transferred to this court by the Supreme Court. Tingle v. Atlanta Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../184/06/index.html">211 Ga. 636</a></span> (87 S. E. 2d 841). When this case was before the Supreme Court the plaintiff in error stated that the reason why the Supreme Court had jurisdiction was that the case involved the title to land. In transferring the case the Supreme Court expressly decided that title to land was not involved and inferentially decided that no equity was involved.</div><div class="casepar">1. For the purpose of a decision of this case we are going to assume for the sake of argument, without deciding, three things: (1) that Code (Ann.)  37-608 gives the authority to a judge of the superior court to declare 'such a sale as we have here to be absolutely void rather than merely to order another sale because of an irregularity; (2) that the defendant here can urge the invalidity of the sale on the ground of a third party's petition in the bankruptcy court; and (3) that 11 U. S. C. A.  828, which provides that such a petition as we have here shall operate "as a stay of any act or proceeding to enforce any lien upon the real property or chattel real of a debtor" includes title to secure debt. It would also seem that the Bankruptcy Act, upon the filing of a proper petition in the nature of the one in this case, would have exclusive jurisdiction of property in which the petitioner had an equitable interest. 11 U. S. C. A.  806 (6). The petitioner in this case had an equitable interest, having purchased the property subject to a security deed. The defendant in error's contention that Ingle had no equitable interest entitling him to file such a petition is without merit. The contention is that Ingle had only a right to redeem by paying the debt. Such is not the case. The law with reference to a right of redemption refers to the right to redeem under a sale made before the filing of the petition and in this case there was no such sale. The sale was made after a petition was filed.</div><div class="casepar">At the time of the sale under power in this case the petition filed by Ingle was imperfect and incomplete. It is our opinion that even though it was incomplete it was sufficient to constitute a kind of lis pendens and to give the bankruptcy court full jurisdiction of the property involved here from the date of the filing of the petition if it was perfected within the ten days which the court might have allowed for such completion. However, the petition filed by Ingle was never perfected so far as the record shows even as late as February following the sale under power. The certificate of the clerk of the court shows that the petition had not been perfected on February 17, 1955. In such a case we do not think the filing of such a petition had the effect of rendering the sale under power void. It is true that the plaintiff herein made the sale at its risk but it had a right to do so if knowledge of such a petition filed in the bankruptcy court did not adversely affect the bidding at the sale. In this case there is no allegation that the reading of the notice of the filing of the bankruptcy petition chilled the bidding or adversely affected the sale in any way. If there had been such an allegation and evidence supporting it, the confirmation of the sale would have been improper. Since the petition in bankruptcy was not perfected as required by law, its pendency did not ripen into a proceeding which put the title to the property in the bankruptcy court.</div><div class="casepar">There is another reason why the filing of the bankruptcy petition by Ingle did not stay the proceeding to sell under power in the deed to secure debt. 11 U. S. C. A.  828 provides: "Unless and until otherwise ordered by the court, upon hearing and after notice to the debtor and all other parties in interest, the filing of a petition under this chapter shall operate as a stay of any act or proceeding to enforce any lien upon the real property or chattel real of a debtor." There is no evidence in this case that any hearing was held on the bankruptcy petition or that any official notice to interested parties was given by the bankruptcy court or at its direction. It therefore follows that, since the legal prerequisites to the petition's operation as a stay are lacking, the mere filing of the petition, even if it had been a full and complete one, would not have and did not operate as a stay as contended by the plaintiff in error.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence on the question of the value of the property at the time of the sale was conflicting and the judge was authorized to find that the amount it sold for represented its value at the time. Mrs. Mansfield swore that she was the former owner of the property, was familiar with its condition and that her bid was its present value.</div><div class="casepar">The judge did not err in confirming the sale.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
