Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Tanksley.</div><div class="casepresiding">DEEN, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. Where an integrated contract under seal for the sale of stock contained no indication that the purchaser was acting on behalf of a third person, evidence to the effect that the parties both understood that a third person was in fact intended to be the purchaser is not admissible for the purpose of relieving the alleged agent of his obligations under the contract, except in an action for reformation of the contract.</div><div class="casepar">2. The consideration for the appellant's promise to pay was the assignment to him of all the seller's right, title and interest in corporate stock subscribed and paid for by Koskey. The subsequent refusal of the corporation to deliver the stock certificates was not a failure of consideration as between the purchaser Haas and seller Koskey because the subscriber-seller and the assignee-purchaser had the same proprietary interest in either event.</div><div class="casepar">The parties to this action, T. L. W. Corporation, and its president Wood entered into a contract reciting that Koskey had previously subscribed to 1/3 of the shares of corporate stock, that no stock had been issued, that she desired to dispose of all stock and options, and that Haas wished to acquire all such stock and options. The contract contained the agreement of Haas to pay Koskey $8,000; of Koskey to assign all her interest in the stock, options, etc. to him, and of Wood and T. L. W. Corp. to hold her harmless against certain note payments and other claims, and to issue to Haas a certificate for 1/3 of its capital stock previously subscribed for by Koskey. The contract, which was under seal, contained the clauses: "The parties hereto hereby agree that any and all other agreements, whether verbal or written, heretofore entered into among or between Koskey and any of the other parties to this agreement are merged into this agreement and shall, after the execution of this agreement, be null, void and of no effect" and "This agreement represents the sole and entire agreement between the parties hereto, shall be binding upon their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and transferees, and it can only be amended in writing signed by all of the parties hereto."</div><div class="casepar">Wood vanished and the corporation became defunct. No stock had been issued. Koskey sued Haas for price, and moved for summary judgment. Haas defended on the grounds of (a) failure of consideration, and (b) agency. As to the latter defense, he produced a contract between himself and one Peek in which Peek agreed to purchase from Haas all shares which Haas might obtain from Koskey, at the purchase price paid. Haas stated that Koskey had understood from the beginning that he had no interest in the stock but that it was being purchased by him as agent for Peek. Peek had wanted a controlling interest in the corporation and Haas believed it was to the corporate interest to have such a change of management; Wood, however, did not wish to relinquish control and it was believed he would not issue or surrender any stock if Peek were known to be the purchaser, for which reason he, having disclosed his principal to Koskey, could not be held personally liable.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendant's motion and defendant appeals.</div><div class="casepar">1. This contract is integrated in that according to its terms it merges and nullifies all previous agreements, represents the sole agreement between the parties, and can be amended only in writing. Haas undertook to assume sole liability for price. Nowhere in the instrument is there any language from which an inference might be drawn that he was acting as agent for another. Further, it is under seal. Under these circumstances parol evidence is inadmissible to show agency where the purpose of such evidence is to relieve the agent from personal liability, he having thus assumed personal liability.</div><div class="casepar">In the first place, the contract is a sealed instrument and the general "rule as to defenses can have no application where the instrument sued on is a sealed instrument and the principal does not appear to be a party thereto. In 2 AmJur 311,  395, it is stated that where the contract sued on is under seal, it is not competent to introduce extrinsic evidence to show that the contract was executed on behalf of an undisclosed principal." Hollingsworth v. Georgia Fruit Growers, Inc., <span class="casemissing">185 Ga. 873</span>, 875 (<span class="casemissing">196 SE 766</span>). See also Harp v. First Nat. Bank of Reynolds, <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. 768 (2) (161 SE 355)</span>; Brega v. CSRA Realty Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../151/76/index.html">223 Ga. 724 (157 SE2d 738)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Of course, from the defendant's point of view, the alleged principal was not "undisclosed" so far as notice to this plaintiff aliunde the contract is concerned, for she understood that he was acting simply in Peek's behalf. Further, Haas had an obligation to Peek to purchase for him at cost all stock shares he might obtain from Koskey. Our question may then be phrased: May an agent of a disclosed principal who is not a party to an integrated contract defend on the ground that he and one of the other contracting parties, the plaintiff here, understood and agreed that he was acting, not individually, but only as the agent for his principal? Bostwick Banking Co. v. Arnold, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/48/index.html">227 Ga. 18 (178 SE2d 890)</a></span>, holds the defendant agent to liability in like circumstances on one ground, among others, that in Georgia parol evidence is not admissible to add to or vary the terms of an unambiguous written contract, but this case also involved a promissory note and therefore provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code which have no bearing here. U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Coastal Service, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../674/61/index.html">103 Ga. App. 133 (118 SE2d 710)</a></span> states flatly that "[t]he parol evidence rule does not preclude testimony to show that the buyer in a contract was acting as agent for an undisclosed principal where the contract is an ordinary one not under seal." While this in itself distinguishes the cases, we also note that the defense was on the ground of mistake, and that the contract was merely a bill of sale for a car which contained no such integration clauses as we are dealing with here. It must be restricted to its own facts, and it illustrates those cases involving simple contracts where the agency is disclosed but the principal unnamed in the memorandum and where in fact parol testimony may be admitted for the purpose of relieving the agent of liability. See also to the same effect Fitzgerald Cotton Oil Co. v. Farmers Supply Co., <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. App. 212 (59 SE 713)</span>; Stubbs &amp; Co. v. Waddell, <span class="casemissing">4 Ga. App. 264 (61 SE 145)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Code  4-406 provides: "Where the agency is known, and the credit is not expressly given to the agent, he shall not be personally responsible upon the contract. The question to whom the credit is given is a question of fact to be decided by the jury under the circumstances in each case." This is a rule of substantive law. What we are dealing with is how to prove that credit was extended to the principal only, taking into account the parol evidence rule of Code  20-704 (1). In Garrison v. Piatt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../647/94/index.html">113 Ga. App. 94 (147 SE2d 374)</a></span> the evidence was somewhat different in that the signatory in a contract arising from mutual correspondence was alleged, by the language of his letters and the stationery used, to have assumed individual liability by holding himself out as a partner, which in fact he was not. This represents a case of partially disclosed rather than undisclosed agency. The contract garnered from the correspondence was not under seal and not integrated. The rule allowing parol evidence was correct under the facts of that case, but it is not necessarily of universal application. The same is true in the case of Yarbrough &amp; Co. v. Travis Pruitt &amp; Associates, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../595/35/index.html">130 Ga. App. 49 (202 SE2d 227)</a></span>, where a verdict was in fact entered against the defendant claiming an agency defense.</div><div class="casepar">An agent of a disclosed principal who has not so acted as to assume individual liability with or instead of his principal is not liable for a breach of contract, but the burden is on him to prove that he was acting for a designated person, that the opposite party had notice of this fact, and that he did not assume individual liability. Where the agent appears to have assumed individual liability, either with or instead of, such a principal, the burden is upon him to show otherwise. In both cases, of course, he must do so by admissible evidence.</div><div class="casepar">"Integrated Contracts. (1) If it appears unambiguously in an integrated contract that the agent is a party or is not a party, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show a contrary intent, except for the purpose of reforming the contract . . . (3) If the fact of agency does not appear in an integrated contract, an agent who appears to be a party thereto cannot introduce extrinsic evidence to show that he is not a party, except: (a) for the purpose of reforming the contract; or (b) to establish that his name was signed as the business name of the principal and that it was so agreed by the parties." Restatement of the Law 2d, Agency 2d  323, p. 72.</div><div class="casepar">While there is authority to the effect that parol evidence is admissible to prove that an unnamed party is in fact liable as a principal, on the theory that this does not alter, vary, or contradict the contract, nor does it exonerate the agent, but that it merely superadds the liability of the principal, "[t]he foregoing principles cannot, however, be carried to the extent of varying the express terms of the writing, and it has, accordingly, been held that, if a contract purports to be executed by one in his own behalf, or shows without ambiguity that the one so executing, although an agent, binds himself as principal, parol evidence is inadmissible to show that the agent acted for his principal in making the contract. So, where a contract recites that it represents the entire agreement between the parties, it cannot be shown by extrinsic parol evidence that one of the signatories did not sign, as recited therein, on his own behalf, but signed as agent of another." 32A CJS 501, Evidence,  991.</div><div class="casepar">The same rule is stated in IX Wigmore on Evidence, (3d Ed.)  2438, p. 124, where authority is quoted to support the statement that parol evidence is admissible to show that a written contract executed in the name of the agent is in fact the contract of the principal, whether known or unknown. "Parol evidence, however, is not admissible to discharge the agent, as the party with whom he has dealt has his election as to whether he will hold him or the principal responsible." Id., p. 125. Candler v. DeGive, <span class="casemissing">133 Ga. 486 (66 SE 244)</span> is in accord with this authority. There one J. L. DeGive, identifying himself as president of an association, agreed to pay a set sum on delivery of certain books to the association. The inference was that he assumed personal liability, although the contract was obviously for the benefit of the association, and he was subject to being sued individually, with parol evidence admissible only to determine the intention of the contract as written. Where it appears from the instrument that the alleged agent and not his principal is bound, such entity cannot be held liable. Latham Plumbing &amp;c. Co. v. Ledbetter Trucks, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../691/17/index.html">96 Ga. App. 219 (99 SE2d 545)</a></span>. This contract obligation was assumed by Haas as an individual, and he is liable thereon. The grant of summary judgment was proper.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
