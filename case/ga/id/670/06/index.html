A provision in an automobile-liability-insurance policy that none of the terms of the policy (including an exclusion clause) shall be waived except by endorsement issued to form a part of the policy, and that no knowledge possessed by an agent shall effect a waiver or estop the company from asserting any right under the policy, is valid and binding.</div><div class="casepar">2. However, provisions in the policy of insurance requiring that all waivers shall be in writing do not apply where the insurer itself has knowledge of the facts creating the exclusion and, with such knowledge, accepts and retains increased premiums owed to it only in the event the exclusion is not effective.</div><div class="casepar">This is an action by the plaintiff insurance company, seeking a declaratory judgment. Specifically, it wishes to ascertain whether it is bound to defend certain actions against the insured, T. C. Hunnicutt, one of the defendants herein, based upon the following facts. The local agent, who thoroughly understood that Hunnicutt's business was that of a mortician and that he wished to be fully covered by liability insurance on a station wagon to be used as a family car, a funeral car and an emergency car in connection with Hunnicutt's business, informed him both before and after the purchase of the vehicle that the policy would fully cover him. The policy issued, however, contained an exclusion stating that it did not apply while the vehicle was used as a public or livery conveyance. it was further provided in the policy that none of the terms of the policy shall be waived or changed except by endorsement issued to form a part of the policy and that no knowledge possessed by an agent or any other person shall effect a waiver or estop the company from asserting any right under the policy. After the policy was issued, the agent sent the usual report to the company showing that Hunnicutt was a mortician, and that the automobile was to be used in his business as much. The plaintiff then wrote its agent as follows: "If the station wagon covered by this policy is used as a funeral car or for transporting passengers in a funeral, we believe the B. I. rate should be increased to $42." In conformity with this letter the agent charged and collected the increased premium, which was endorsed on the original policy and was charged and collected on renewal policies. At the time of the collision out of which this litigation arose, the insured Hunnicutt's station wagon was being used as an ambulance to transport a passenger for hire.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court, deciding the case by agreement on the pleadings, exhibits and depositions, held the plaintiff insurance company liable to the extent of its full coverage in connection with the instant collision, and the exception is to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar">1. A provision in an automobile liability insurance policy that none of the terms of the policy shall be waived except by endorsement issued to form a pact of the policy, and that no knowledge possessed by an agent shall effect a waiver or estop the company from asserting any right under the policy, is valid and binding. Bailey v. First Nat. Fire Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. App. 213 (89 SE 80)</span>; Gulf Life Ins. Co. v. Yearta, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 43 (10 SE2d 120)</span>. Thus, knowledge by the insurance agent that real estate has become vacant so as to come under an exclusion clause in the policy, coupled with the agent's promises to see that the building remains insured, coupled with the acceptance and retention of the whole premium by the insurer, is not sufficient to work a waiver or estoppel where the insurance company does not in fact retain the premiums with knowledge that the building is in fact vacant. Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. of Conn. v. Fields, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/80/index.html">212 Ga. 814 (96 SE2d 502)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In the instant case, proof that the insured, a mortician, informed the local agent of the insurance company that he wished to purchase and obtain insurance on a station wagon to be used by him for family purposes and also in his business as a mortician, both in connection with funerals and for ambulance service as an emergency vehicle, is not sufficient in and of itself to bind the insurance company issuing a "family combination automobile policy" or to constitute notice to it that the station wagon was intended for such use within the terms of the policy to be issued.</div><div class="casepar">2. However, provisions in the policy of insurance requiring that all waivers shall be in writing do not apply where, as in the instant case, the insurer itself has knowledge of the facts creating the exclusion and, with such knowledge, accepts and retains increased premiums owed to it only in the event the exclusion is not effective. This amounts to an implied waiver of the provisions of such exclusion. Harmon v. State Mutual Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 265 (42 SE2d 761)</span>; Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Boatright, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../682/92/index.html">100 Ga. App. 493 (111 SE2d 645)</a></span>; Sentinel Fire Ins. Co. v. McRoberts, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 732</span>, 738 (<span class="casemissing">179 SE 256</span>); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Hardin, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 275 (149 SE 318)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the plaintiff's contention that the increased premium did not affect the exclusion of use of the insured vehicle as a public livery or conveyance is, under the circumstances of this case, without merit. The company specifically charged the premium because the vehicle was to be used for "transporting passengers" and, to that extent it obviously and affirmatively estopped itself from insisting upon the terms of that exclusion. It contends, however, that the implicit permission to allow the use of transporting passengers is limited by its letter to its agent merely to "transporting passengers in a funeral" and did not extend to transporting passengers as an emergency ambulance. If this was the intent, it was obviously ineffective, since the company did not instruct its agent and the agent did not understand that he was supposed to put any such limitation on the use of the station wagon by the insured. The company, with notice of a business use by the insured, increased the premium accordingly, and such endorsement on the policy, plus the acceptance of increased benefits by the company, estops it from relying upon a right which it would otherwise have had to insist upon the literal tends of the exclusion. Morticians in Georgia generally and regularly transport passengers in emergency ambulance service, and this is as much a business use as transporting passengers in funeral processions. By acceding to the use of transporting passengers in consideration of an increased premium with out notifying the insured that it intended the transport to be restricted to only one part of the insured's business, the company estopped itself from relying upon the exclusion clause in its policy of insurance.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff insurance company was therefore liable under the terms of the policy of automobile liability insurance issued to the insured Hunnicutt, and the trial court did not err in so ruling.</div><div class="casepar">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</div><div class="casepar">JORDAN, Judge. It is contended by the plaintiff insurance company on motion for rehearing that the principle of law set out and followed by this court in the second division of the opinion is inapplicable to this case since notice of the business use of the insured's vehicle was not given to the company but only to its agent and that the letter referred to in the opinion was merely an exchange of correspondence between two agents of the company.</div><div class="casepar">The pleadings therefore affirmatively show that such notice was given to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff wrote the letter to the writing agent after receipt of such notice. Since, as stated in the opinion, this case was decided by the trial judge by agreement of the parties on the pleadings, exhibits and depositions, the trial judge was fully authorized to find that the plaintiff company had such notice, and the motion for rehearing is accordingly without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Motion for rehearing denied.
