F. Howell filed suit against Muscogee County in the City Court of Columbus for money had and received. The petition as amended alleged that the petitioner was at all times mentioned therein the duly elected and serving Sheriff of Muscogee County, Georgia. As such Sheriff of Muscogee County, Georgia, petitioner was duly designated and was acting at all times mentioned therein as agent of the Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia; that, as agent for the said Georgia State Revenue Commissioner, petitioner was entitled to be compensated for the endorsement of delinquent applications for State vehicle license tags, the rate of such compensation being fixed by Georgia law. The petition further alleged that for services rendered as agent of the State Revenue Commissioner the petitioner received from said State Revenue Commissioner for the period from April, 1957, through March, 1960, $33,131.81, and for the period of April through August, 1960, $7,056.92.</div><div class="casepar">The petition as amended then alleged as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"5. Upon receipt of each check received from said Commissioner each of which checks are made payable to petitioner, petitioner endorsed such check and turned it over to defendant, through Paul Jones, Clerk of the Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Muscogee, County, Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">"(a) Said payments were made by plaintiff to defendant under and by virtue of a contract dated October 22, 1957, which said contract plaintiff has now discovered to be null and void and of no legal effect whatsoever, which fact defendant now well knows.</div><div class="casepar">"(b) A copy of said contract is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit 'B.'</div><div class="casepar">"6. Said sums of money paid to defendant were retained by Muscogee County, Georgia. Said money has not been repaid to petitioner except in the sum of $5,850.00 and defendant has not accounted to petitioner for said money. Said figure $5,850.00 was paid according to the exhibit attached hereto as Exhibit 'A.'</div><div class="casepar">"7. Defendant has given no value to petitioner for said money, has no claim to such and has no property right or rights therein. Defendant because of the facts set out cannot in equity and good conscience retain said money as against the claim of plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">"8. Because of the state of facts hereinbefore set out defendant has been and presently is unjustly enriched by the sum of $34,338.73 which defendant has in its possession which belongs to and should be paid to the petitioner."</div><div class="casepar">The contact, omitting the nonessential parts, attached to the petition as Exhibit B is as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, Sheriff E. F. Howell, as license tag agent and sheriff for Muscogee County, Georgia, has collected from April 1, 1956, to May 31, 1957, indorsement fees in the amount of three thousand one hundred twenty dollars ($3,120.00) and penalties in the amount of four thousand eight hundred fourteen and 25/100 dollars ($4,814.25) on delinquent license tag applications; and, he has collected the additional sum of one thousand ninety-five and 75/100 dollars ($1,095.75) in tag fees, the sum of four hundred eight dollars ($408.00) in indorsement fees, and the sum of six hundred eighty-nine and 98/100 ($689.98) dollars in penalties, from June 1, 1957, to September 30, 1957, all of said monies in the amount of ten thousand one hundred twenty-seven and 98/100 dollars ($10,127.98) now being retained by the sheriff; and,</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, the County Attorney for Muscogee County, Georgia, has advised the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Muscogee County, Georgia, that it is his opinion that said funds are the property of Muscogee County, Georgia, and all of said funds should be paid to the county fiscal authorities by said sheriff; and,</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, the Attorney-General of the State of Georgia has rendered an opinion to the State Revenue Commissioner that the sheriff is entitled to retain said indorsement fees and penalties; and</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, in order to settle the differences of legal interpretation, the sheriff has offered to settle and adjust said matter on the following terms:</div><div class="casepar">'a. That the board and the sheriff recognize the ruling of the Attorney-General insofar as it applies to the indorsement fees collected between April 1, 1956, and May 31, 1957, in the amount of $3,120.00.</div><div class="casepar">'b. That the sheriff and the board recognize the ruling of the county attorney insofar as it applies to the penalties collected between April 1, 1956, and May 31, 1957; and insofar as said ruling applies to tag fees, penalties, and indorsements collected between June 1, 1957, and September 30, 1957, totalling seven thousand seven and 98/100 dollars ($7,007.98) which the sheriff will turn over to the county authorities.</div><div class="casepar">'c. That the sheriff and the board recognize the ruling of the county attorney insofar as it applies to the tag fees, penalties and indorsements collected by the sheriff after June 1, 1957, and the sheriff will turn over to the county fiscal authorities all tag fees, indorsements and penalties collected by him as tag agent and as sheriff from this date forward on the first day of the month following the collection of said tag fees, indorsement fees and penalties, or as soon thereafter as an accounting can be made.</div><div class="casepar">'d. That the sheriff willingly agrees to continue the strict enforcement of the license tag laws and he further agrees that he will continue the strict collection of tag fees as tag agent, and the strict collection of indorsements and penalties as sheriff, all as by law provided'; and</div><div class="casepar">"Whereas, it is considered to the best interest of Muscogee County to settle and adjust this matter on the terms herein set forth;</div><div class="casepar">"Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Muscogee County, Georgia, that said matter be settled and adjusted on the terms herein set forth.</div><div class="casepar">"Be it further resolved that the contract heretofore authorized by this board to be executed by the chairman on behalf of Muscogee County, Georgia, with Honorable Albert W. Stubbs for attorney's fees in the proposed collection of said monies from the sheriff be, and the same is hereby, rescinded, and that said contract not be entered into.</div><div class="casepar">"The foregoing resolution was introduced and read at the regular meeting of the Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Muscogee County, Georgia, held on the 22 day of October, 1957, and regularly adopted at said meeting.</div><div class="casepar">" 'Georgia, Muscogee County:</div><div class="casepar">'The foregoing resolution has been read, and the terms thereof agreed to. There is tendered this date the sum of $7,007.98 to Muscogee County, Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">'This the 22nd day of October, 1957.</div><div class="casepar">/s/ E. F. Howell, Sheriff' "</div><div class="casepar">The trial court sustained the defendant's general demurrer to the petition as amended, to which judgment the plaintiff excepted.</div><div class="casepar">While the section designates the sheriff as being one of the persons authorized to render and receive compensation for such indorsement service, nevertheless, he is for the performance of that service only an agent of the Commissioner and, as such an agent, he was personally paid for the services he rendered. It is not compensation which he earned in his official capacity as sheriff, but compensation which he received in his personal capacity as an agent of the State Revenue Commissioner." It is therefore clear from this ruling that the monies involved in this litigation belonged to the plaintiff individually and were not such funds as the defendant county would have been entitled to receive under the provisions of an act of the General Assembly placing the Sheriff of Muscogee County on a salary basis. Ga. L. 1952, p. 2180, as amended by Ga. L. 1957, p. 2266.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is contended by the plaintiff that the contract entered into between him and the county is not valid under the decision of Owens v. Floyd County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../690/68/index.html">96 Ga. App. 25 (2) (99 SE2d 560)</a></span>, which states as follows: "Where the compensation of a public official is fixed by the General Assembly such public official is without authority, by express agreement or otherwise, to fix a different compensation for such public office." This principle of law does not apply to the situation in this case in view of the ruling in the Broome case, supra, to the effect that such compensation was received by the plaintiff in his personal and individual capacity as agent for the State Revenue Commissioner and not as compensation attaching to his office as Sheriff of Muscogee County. Since compensation "belonging to the office" is not involved, the contract cannot be said to be an agreement by a public official to fix a different compensation for his office other than that established by the General Assembly.</div><div class="casepar">3. It appears from the pleadings that the payments made by the plaintiff to the defendant were made under the provisions of a contract voluntarily entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant for the purpose of settling and adjusting a controversy existing between the plaintiff and the defendant as to the ownership of these funds. The contract in question appears to meet all of the essentials of a valid contract and is enforceable between the parties even though the plaintiff was not aware of his legal rights at the time the contract was made. "Payments not made under duress, and made with knowledge of all the facts, without fraud or deception on the part of the person to whom payment is made, though in ignorance of the legal rights of the party paying, are voluntary, and cannot be recovered." McCarty v. Mobley, <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. App. 225 (3) (80 SE 523)</span>; Code  20-1007. There are no allegations in the petition of fraud or deception on the part of the defendant or that the plaintiff was under an urgent and immediate necessity to enter into such an agreement. On the contrary, it appears that the terms of the contract were proposed by the plaintiff in order to settle and adjust the controversy then existing and that he received a portion of the collected fees under the agreement. It is also noted that he continued to abide by the terms of the contract for over 12 months after the decision in the Broome case, supra, on which he apparently based his allegation that he had discovered the contract to be null and void. We are therefore of the opinion that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was both valid and enforceable; and that the payments voluntarily made by the plaintiff to the defendant under said contract cannot be recovered in an action for money had and received. The petition therefore did not state a cause of action.</div><div class="casepar">The pleadings in the instant case fail to allege that the plaintiff has paid money or its equivalent to the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">For the reasons set forth above, the trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the petition.</div><div class="casepar">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the plaintiff in error contend in their motion for rehearing that the plaintiff in performing the duties set forth in the petition as agent of the State Revenue Commissioner was a public officer, entitled to the compensation fixed by the General Assembly for such duties, and therefore entitled to the benefit of the rule that no public officer can agree to accept less than the fees or salary allowed by law, the plaintiff relying on the cases of Johnson v. Brooks, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 787 (78 SE 37)</span>, and MacNeill v. Steele, <span class="casemissing">186 Ga. 792 (199 SE 99)</span>, in addition to Owens v. Floyd County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../690/68/index.html">96 Ga. App. 25</a></span>, supra, for this contention.</div><div class="casepar">Assuming, but not deciding, that such agent of the Revenue Commissioner is a "public officer," within the purview of the cases cited above, the present case is not a dispute between the plaintiff as such agent and the Revenue Commissioner, who under law is the authority required to pay such agent (or "public official") for his services, thereby distinguishing this case from those relied upon by the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">There is no showing in the instant case that the plaintiff did not receive all the compensation from the Revenue Commissioner to which he was entitled as such agent, and it must be assumed that the plaintiff did receive said compensation. Accordingly, the principle of law relied upon by the plaintiff cannot be called to his assistance after he has been fully compensated by the proper authority as provided by law. What he then does with such compensation is purely a personal matter.</div><div class="casepar">In the instant case, the plaintiff voluntarily entered into a contract with the defendant county concerning the disposition of the compensation which he received and which he seeks to recover in this suit. Under the circumstances in this case, the principle of law set forth in the Owens case, supra, does not avail the defendant.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Foley, Chappell, Young &amp; Hollis, Charles M.
