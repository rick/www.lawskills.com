A ruling upon which no assignment of error was made will not be considered by this court.</div><div class="casepar">2. It was not necessary to attach a copy of the will to the claim affidavit.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where, under a proper construction of the pleadings, one individual was not a party to the proceedings, it was not error to overrule various motions asking that such individual be stricken as a party.</div><div class="casepar">4. The trust created by a provision in the testator's will was not subject to any of the attacks made upon it. Hence, property devised to the trustees to hold under the trust provision could not be levied upon by a judgment creditor of the beneficiary of the trust.</div><div class="casepar">5. Since there was no conflict of evidence as to a material issue, the trial judge erred in overruling the claimant's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">These cases arose when Blanche Rucker Thornton Francis sought to levy upon certain described property to satisfy a judgment for alimony and child support obtained against John Fortson Thornton, Jr. The levy of the sheriff declared that "said property is levied upon as property of the defendant in fi. fa." J. F. Thornton, Jr., filed a claim which alleged: "that the aforesaid property is not the property of the defendant in fi. fa., but is the property of affiant and the said Mrs. Mozelle R. Smith Morris, as Trustees for John Fortson Thornton, Jr." Pursuant to the claim, an affidavit in forma pauperis was filed by the claimant Thornton reciting that he, as one of the trustees, swore that the claim was not interposed for delay only; that the trustees bona fide claimed the right and title to the property and that from poverty the trustees were unable to give bond and security as required by law.</div><div class="casepar">The property in question was devised in the will of John Fortson Thornton, Sr., under the following provision: "I will, bequeath and devise to my executors and trustees hereinafter named, the homeplace where I live, and everything in it including the furniture and the 20 acres of land adjoining, together with all money I have in excess of the $8,000.00 bequeathed in Paragraph 3 of this Will. My executors and Trustees shall hold this property for the use and benefit of John Fortson Thornton, Jr. The money shall be placed in a bank or building and loan association at interest, and shall he used to pay the taxes and the upkeep of the homeplace, and for the support and maintenance of my son John Fortson Thornton, Jr., and his children if in the wisdom of my Trustees and executors they should deem this necessary or advisable. If said money is used in its entirety, then my executors and Trustees are authorized to sell part of the land on the side of the homeplace from time to time, and this money shall be used as herein directed."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in fi. fa., Mrs. Francis, moved to dismiss the claim affidavit and affidavit in forma pauperis on the grounds that neither is signed by both the trustees and that the affidavit in form pauperis does not state the trust estate is in poverty. The trial judge overruled the motion to dismiss the claim and pauper's affidavit. Subsequently, the plaintiff in fi. fa. filed general and special demurrers, which were overruled.</div><div class="casepar">The matter came on for trial before a jury in the Elbert Superior Court at which it was stipulated that the land levied upon was, prior to his death, the property of J. F. Thornton, Sr., who was the father of J. F. Thornton, Jr.; that the judgment sought to be levied was for alimony and child support against J. F. Thornton, Jr.; that the will of J. F. Thornton, Sr., had been probated in solemn form and letters testamentary issued to Mrs. Mozelle R. Smith (now Morris) and J. F. Thornton, Jr.; that they were dismissed as executors on August 5, 1963.</div><div class="casepar">Evidence adduced upon the trial showed that J. F. Thornton, Jr., was an adult who, prior to his father's death, had no interest or title in the property in dispute. There was also evidence that he had a "drinking problem" and has dissipated the money left for him in trust. Regarding the discrepancy between the "original" instrument and that recorded in the office of the Clerk of Elbert Superior Court, Thornton testified he signed the original while his attorney who prepared and witnessed the instrument testified it was in that form which executed, not as contained in the records. Both the clerk and his assistant testified they customarily proofread instruments they recorded, although both admitted that sometimes mistakes were made. Neither could recall copying the instrument in question. Mrs. Smith's (Morris) deposition was read in which she stated that she refused to sign the claim affidavit despite a letter requesting that she come to the office of the estate's attorneys to sign the claim papers.</div><div class="casepar">During the trial both parties made motions for directed verdict which were overruled by the presiding judge. The cause was submitted to the jury and, upon their failure to agree upon a verdict, a mistrial was declared. Both parties then filed their motions for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial. The trial judge overruled both motions. Case No. 23030 is here on the claimant's exception to the judgment overruling his motion for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial. In Case No. 23031 the plaintiff in fi. fa. excepted and assigned error to the overruling of her motion to dismiss the claim affidavit and pauper's affidavit "because of improper signature"; to the overruling of her general and special demurrers and to the overruling of her motion for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The plaintiff in fi. fa. did not except to the overruling of her written motion to dismiss the claim affidavit and affidavit in forma pauperis on the grounds that the claimant was not acting in good faith in submitting an affidavit in forma pauperis. Hence, although this point is argued by her counsel in brief to this court, we will not pass upon that judgment.</div><div class="casepar">2. The first ground of special demurrer is predicated on the fact that a copy of the will was not attached to or made a part of the claim. It is contended that under Code  81-105 a copy of the will must be so attached.</div><div class="casepar">The cited Code section applies to petitions and provides that contracts and certain other enumerated instruments or writings "should be incorporated in or attached to the petition in all cases in which they constitute the cause of action, or the relief prayed for must be based thereon." But no pleading is generally necessary in addition to a claim. As held in Stonecypher v. Elliott, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 438</span>, 441 (2) (<span class="casemissing">182 SE 587</span>): "In the trial of a case in which property has been levied upon as that of the defendant in execution, and a third person has intervened as claimant, the claim affidavit, expressed in the usual form, is generally the only pleading necessary to admit whatever evidence the claimant may have to offer to uphold his or her title, or to disparage that of the defendant as a competing title." Hadden v. Larned, <span class="casemissing">87 Ga. 634</span>, 637 (<span class="casemissing">13 SE 806</span>); Frick Co. v. Taylor, <span class="casemissing">94 Ga. 683 (2) (21 SE 713)</span>, Askew v. Amos, <span class="casemissing">147 Ga. 613 (1)</span> <span class="casemissing">95 SE 5</span>). See Oliver v. Dickerson Supply Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../68/index.html">221 Ga. 146 (143 SE2d 632)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. By ground 2 of her special demurrers, in her motion to dismiss and as one of the grounds of her motion for a directed verdict the plaintiff in fi. fa. contends the claim and pauper's affidavits are defective because one of the trustees, Mrs. Smith (now Morris), purporting to be an affiant, did not sign the affidavit and that Mrs. Smith (Morris) should have been stricken as a party.</div><div class="casepar">Neither in the caption, the body or jurat does it appear that Mrs. Morris was a deponent. The caption of the affidavit simply signified that the deponent, J. F. Thornton, Jr., and Mrs. Morris, as trustees, claimed the property described in the affidavit. The jurat shows the deponent was J. F. Thornton, Jr., the effect of which was, while he was without authority of law to undertake to do Mrs. Morris's swearing for her, that he made an affidavit on his own behalf, which he had a right to do.</div><div class="casepar">A person may interpose a claim affidavit although he does not claim all the property. "The interest which will support a claim under our statute, is any interest which renders the property not subject to the levying fi. fa. or attachment, or which is inconsistent with the plaintiff's right to proceed in selling the property." Wade &amp; Co. v. Hamilton, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. 450 (2)</span>; Wheeler v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 164 (1) (88 SE 951)</span>; Butler v. LaGrange Banking &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">177 Ga. 714 (1) (170 SE 918)</span>. It is not necessary that a person having a valid interest in the property levied upon and advertised for sale under an execution join with him other parties having a similar or identical interest in the property levied upon. This is true because the right to interpose a claim is vested in him by virtue of the interest that he himself has in the property, when that interest is sufficient to show such title in the property levied upon as to prevent its sale.</div><div class="casepar">While the affidavit was inaccurate in using the terminology "trustees," under no proper construction of the pleadings could it be concluded that Mrs. Morris was a party. Since Mrs. Morris was never actually a party, it was not error to overrule the various motions asking that she be stricken.</div><div class="casepar">In this same connection, the plaintiff in fi. fa. makes the connection that the affidavit fails to state that the trust is unable to post bond because of its poverty. A perusal of the affidavit clearly shows that J. F. Thornton, Jr. is not acting in an individual capacity but is a trustee of the trust in question. The plain import of the affidavit is that the trust is in poverty, not that either of the named persons, as individuals, is unable to pay the costs.</div><div class="casepar">4. We now consider questions presented by the general demurrer of the plaintiff in fi. fa. and the motions for judgment notwithstanding the mistrial filed by each of the parties. First, we must decide what the rights of the parties are, assuming there is a valid trust. For the plaintiff in fi. fa. citations that, since she seeks to levy on the property under an alimony and child support judgment against her ex-husband, technical distinctions as to title and interest under trust law must be disregarded. We find no merit in this argument. Georgia law, as we view it, does not allow properly held in trust to be levied upon by creditors, judgment or otherwise, of a beneficiary of the trust. Blake v. Irwin, <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. 345</span>, 366; Thomas &amp; Co. v. Crawford, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. 211</span>; Jennings v. Coleman &amp; Newsom, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. 718</span>; Georgia Veneer &amp;c. Co. v. Stevens, <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 522 (97 SE 524)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">This brings us to the controlling question of the case, to wit, is there a valid trust? Counsel for the plaintiff in fi. fa. Blake numerous attacks on its validity. We consider these attacks.</div><div class="casepar">(a) It is contended that there is no separation of legal and equitable title. Counsel for the plaintiff in fi. fa. urges that there must be a beneficiary in a trust and that tho provision of the will makes it discretionary with the trustees as to whether they will support either J. F. Thornton, Jr., or his children.</div><div class="casepar">The will provides that the trust is for the use and benefit of J. F. Thornton, Jr., and from a perusal of its terms the plain intent was that a discretion be exercised as to the children of J. F. Thornton, Jr., but it was mandatory that he be supported. For the will provides that the property "shall be used for the support and maintenance" of J. F. Thornton, Jr.</div><div class="casepar">In this connection, two further contentions are urged: (1) that the provision amounts to a mere charge on the estate; (2) that the trust set out in the will is executed and not executory. Both contentions overlook the unambiguous wording of Ga. L. 1950, pp. 310, 311 (Code Ann.  108-111.1), which reads: "A trust shall be executory, and the legal estate shall remain in the trustee, whether or not the beneficiary or beneficiaries be sui juris and whether or not any remainder interest be created, so long as the trustee has any powers or duties in regard to the trust property such as to preserve or protect, to manage, to invest or reinvest, to collect income or proceeds, to sell or otherwise dispose of, to ascertain the objects or the beneficiaries, or to distribute income or principal." Since the instant trust provides that the money is to be invested at interest and used to pay the taxes and upkeep of the homeplace and for the support and maintenance of J. F. Thornton, Jr., and his children, in the trustees' discretion, and authorizes the trustees to sell part of the land, it is executory under Code Ann.  108-111.1.</div><div class="casepar">(b) In considering the validity of the trust, the question arises as to whether a beneficiary of the trust might also be one of the trustees. This point, as such, is not raised by the plaintiff in fi. fa., but we deem it a pertinent facet of discussion.</div><div class="casepar">Where there is but a single trustee who is also the sole beneficiary, merger of legal and equitable interests results. Code  85-710 and Code  108-112. However, there is a dearth of authority in Georgia concerning the situation where there are plural trustees, one of whom is the sole beneficiary. In those jurisdictions which have examined this question the courts, with virtual unanimity, have held the trusts to be valid. 54 Am. Jur. 102, Trusts,  117, citing Julian v. Northwestern Trust Co., 192 Minn. 136 (255 NW 022); and Ridge v. Bright, 244 NC 345 (<span class="casemissing">93 SE2d 607</span>);; 90 CJS 131, Trusts,  203, citing Mesce v. Gradone, 1 NJ 159 (02 A2d 394), and In re Phipps' Will, 2 NY2d 105 (157 NYS2d 14, 138 NE2d 341). See in this connection Leavitt v. Leavitt, <span class="casemissing">149 Ga. 601 (101 SE 670)</span>, where this court approved a trust in which the sole trustee was one of the beneficiaries under a deed; and McCreary v. Gewinner, <span class="casemissing">103 Ga. 528</span>, 534 (<span class="casemissing">29 SE 960</span>), where this court in construing  3148 of the Civil Code of 1895 (now Code  408-101 and 108-102) stated: "A trust is an equitable obligation, either express or implied, resting upon a person by reason of a confidence reposed in him, to apply or deal with property for the benefit of some other person, or for the benefit of himself and another or others, according to such confidence."</div><div class="casepar">In view of the Georgia cases above cited as well as the weight of authority of our sister States, we agree with the soundness of such pronouncements. The further fact that here the children in the discretion of the trustees, also might receive support from the income of the trust impels us to the conclusion that there are no grounds for merger by operation of law and that the trust arrangement is a valid one.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The will provides that the personal property and land of the testator be held by the trustees for the use and benefit of A. F. Thornton, Jr. "The money shall be placed in a bank or building loan association at interest, and shall be used to pay the taxes and the upkeep of the homeplace, and for the support and maintenance of my son John Fortson Thornton, Jr., and his children" in the discretion of the trustees. It is contended that the trust created by this provision is fatally defective because: (1) no remainder estate is created, (2) the trust contains no termination date, and (3) it violates the rule against perpetuities.</div><div class="casepar">(1) Code Ann.  108-111.1 provides that a trust shall be executory whether or not any remainder estate be created. Moore v. First Nat. Bank &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../165/22/index.html">218 Ga. 798</a></span>, 800 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../165/22/index.html">130 SE2d 718</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">Of course, the time for termination is limited by the rule against perpetuities or the rule against restraint on alienation. 54 Am. Jur. 75, Trusts,  70.</div><div class="casepar">(3) We thus consider whether the trust provision violates the rule against perpetuities. In construing a will, we must first give effect to the intent of the testator. Lanier v. Lanier, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../163/49/index.html">218 Ga. 137</a></span>, 140 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../163/49/index.html">126 SE2d 776</a></span>). Here it seems evident that after the purposes of the trust were fulfilled, the testator intended the corpus of the trust to revert to his estate and pass by intestacy. In Oliver v. Powell, <span class="casemissing">114 Ga. 592 (4) (40 SE 826)</span>, this court found that, where one was a beneficiary for life with no remainder created by the will, a reversion was created in the estate, which reversionary interest vested immediately upon the testator's death. Code  85-701 provides: "An estate in reversion is the residue of an estate, usually the fee left in the grantor and his heirs after the determination of a particular estate which he has granted out of it. The rights of the reversioner are the same as these of a vested remainderman in fee." Since the rule against perpetuities involves remoteness of vesting, it is not applicable to a vested remainder or to a reversion. Erskine v. Klein, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../163/42/index.html">218 Ga. 112</a></span>, 117 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../163/42/index.html">126 SE2d 755</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">Since, in any event, the trust would not terminate until the death of J. F. Thornton, Jr., he would never have such interest in the property in question so that it would be subject to a judgment obtained against him by his ex-wife, the plaintiff in fi. fa.</div><div class="casepar">5. The final contention made by the plaintiff in fi. fa. is that there was a conflict in the evidence as to a material issue, that is, as to whether the original assent by the executors was as contended by the claimant or whether it was in the form as recorded in the clerk's office. Because of this conflict in the evidence she contends that a judgment notwithstanding the mistrial in the claimant's favor was properly refused.</div><div class="casepar">The instrument by which the executors assented to the devise in the will could not exceed the power granted in the will. Hence, even if the original deed purported to convey fee simple title to the beneficiary, J. F. Thornton, Jr., it would violate the expressed intent of the testator and thus could not convey such title to J. F. Thornton, Jr. It is therefore apparent that evidence of what was contained in the original instrument relative to the executor's assent would be of no consequence and any conflict would not be as to a material matter.</div><div class="casepar">The trust set out in the will being a valid one, the property would not be subject to levy and sale on a judgment obtained against J. F. Thornton, Jr. Hence, the trial judge erred in overruling the claimant's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in Case No. 23031; reversed in Case No. 23030.
