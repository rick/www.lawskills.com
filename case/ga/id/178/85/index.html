A dispute which involves the validity of a bargaining agreement between a railroad and a union, and not its meaning, cannot be resolved by interpretation so as to give jurisdiction to the Railway Adjustment Board to the exclusion of State courts.</div><div class="casepar">2. Members of the union organization who have constituted the organization exclusive bargaining agent on behalf of all employees of their employer, are bound by the terms of a contract made on their behalf by the organization; and where the employee acquires his seniority under such contract, he is bound by the imitation that the contract may be revised or abrogated, and any rights acquired under the contract may be revised or abrogated by a subsequent valid amendment thereto.</div><div class="casepar">(a) An employee has no inherent right to seniority in service; and where seniority arises only out of contract, such rights created and arising under the contract do not extend beyond its life when it has been legally terminated.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The collective-bargaining agreement between the railroad and the brotherhood, which was the duly authorized bargaining representative for the conductors involved, and which provided (or compulsory retirement at the age of 70, was not discriminatory because, while each conductor will be affected at a different time, the effect will be the same, as each will be retired upon reaching the age of 70.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Compulsory retirement at the age of 70 is a proper object of a bargaining agreement within the meaning of the Railway Labor Act.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The railroad was not required to examine into the specific authority of the bargaining agent, the railroad brotherhood here, as such authority may be affected by the by-laws and charter of the collective bargaining agent where the railroad is not charged with notice of such alleged violation, and where the brotherhood was the undisputed recognized bargaining agent of the complaining employee.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in error (plaintiff below) sought to enjoin the defendant railway company and the defendant union or brotherhood from enforcing his compulsory retirement as a conductor of the railroad because he had attained the age of 70 years. His petition alleged that he had been in the employ of the defendant railroad for more than 49 years, was now 72 years of age, was in good health and fully able to perform his duties as a conductor, and that the railroad ordered his retirement solely because of an amendment, dated February 3, 1955, to a collective-bargaining agreement entered into between the railroad and the brotherhood in 1937 and amended in 1940, the said amendment providing that conductors shall forfeit all seniority and retire from service when they attain 70 years of age.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff contends that the agreement is invalid for several reasons, to wit, that to deprive him of his seniority rights, which are property rights, and force his retirement, deprives him of his property without due process of law in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions; that it is discriminatory, in that it discriminates in favor of the younger conductors and against the older ones; that compulsory retirement because of age is not a proper subject of negotiation between the railroad and the union, either under the Railway Labor Act or under the agreement of 1937 as revised in 1940; and that the union exceeded its authority in negotiating said contract and failed to comply with the rules and statutes of said union in adopting the contract.</div><div class="casepar">By its demurrers the defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the court, contended that the agreement requiring compulsory retirement is valid, and for that reason no cause of action is stated; and that injunction or equitable relief is not a proper remedy.</div><div class="casepar">To that part of the court's order sustaining the demurrer to the petition, the plaintiff excepted by main bill of exceptions; and to the order overruling the demurrer on the question of jurisdiction and as to injunction being an appropriate remedy the defendant railroad company excepted in a cross-bill of exceptions.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The court did not err in holding that it had jurisdiction. The question here involved is the validity of the contract entered into between the union and the railroad on February 3, 1955, amending the original agreement of 1937 as revised in 1940, providing compulsory retirement of conductors upon reaching the age of 70 years. Its meaning is perfectly clear, for it plainly provides that conductors must retire upon reaching the age of 70 years. There is no dispute between the parties about its meaning. The entire controversy is as to its validity. It is contended that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the matters involved are within the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board exclusively under Title 45,  153 of U. S. C. A., as the contracts were negotiated under provisions of the Railway Labor Act. It has been definitely established that the courts are without power to interpret union collective agreements prior to an interpretation of such agreement by the Railway Adjustment Board, where the interpretation will govern future relations between the parties. Slocum v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. Co., 339 U. S. 239 (1) (70 Sup. Ct. 577, 94 L. ed. 795); Order of Ry. Conductors of America v. Pitney, 326 U. S. 561 (66 Sup. Ct. 322, 90 L. ed. 318); Order of Railway Conductors of America v. Southern Railway Co., 339 U. S. 255 (70 Sup. Ct. 585, 94 L. ed. 811); Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../182/85/index.html">211 Ga. 263</a></span> (85 S. E. 2d 413).</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the railroad concede in their brief that four district court cases, cited by them in support of the validity of the contract, rejected contentions as to jurisdiction similar to theirs and held that the court had jurisdiction. McMullans v. Kansas, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf Ry. Co., 129 Fed. Supp. 157; Goodin v. Churchfield Railroad Co., 125 Fed. Supp. 441; Boget v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad Co. (not reported) ; Beasley v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. (not reported). See also Williams v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 124 Fed. Supp. 164; Moore v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., 312 U. S. 630 (61 Sup. Ct. 754, 85 L. ed. 1089).</div><div class="casepar">Nothing contained herein is in conflict with Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, supra, for there the majority held that the question was the interpretation of the agreement, which would result primarily in a determination of future relations between the carrier and the employee, and that the validity of the contract was not in issue.</div><div class="casepar">In view of the holding in the next division, it is not necessary to deal with the other alleged error in the cross-bill of exceptions, that injunction was not a proper remedy in this case.</div><div class="casepar">2. We next deal with the main bill of exceptions, wherein it is contended that the compulsory retirement agreement was invalid for a number of reasons.</div><div class="casepar">The first reason assigned is that, by and through the collective-bargaining agreement of 1937, as revised in 1940, the plaintiff had and has a vested property right in his acquired seniority, and that the collective-bargaining agreement of 1955 is invalid, null, and void because it divests him of his seniority rights, thus taking his property without due process of law in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions.</div><div class="casepar">Under the original agreement of 1937, as revised in 1940, it is provided that the agreement may be "revised or abrogated." It is under this contract that the plaintiff contends that he has acquired his seniority, a vested property right . . . He was a member of the union at the time the contract was negotiated and the union was his recognized bargaining representative.</div><div class="casepar">"The members of a union organization, who have constituted the organization exclusive bargaining agent on behalf of all employees of their employer, are bound by the terms of a contract made on their behalf by the organization." Savage v. Western Union Telegraph Co., <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 728 (2)</span> (32 S. E. 2d 785). Having acquired his seniority under this contract, he is bound by the limitation that, the contract may be revised or abrogated, and any rights acquired under that contract would be subject to revision or abrogation by a subsequent valid amendment thereto. See Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U. S. 330 (73 Sup. Ct. 681, 97 L. ed. 1048); Lewellyn v. Fleming, 154 Fed. 2d 211; Elder v. New York Cent. R. Co., 152 Fed. 2d 361. One may waive or renounce his constitutional rights; and if the plaintiff acquired seniority under the contract, he could under the same contract, as he did here, agree that the contract might be waived or abrogated. Bradford v. Mills, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../191/70/index.html">208 Ga. 198 (1)</a></span> (66 S. E. 2d 58).</div><div class="casepar">The above disposes of the question of whether the plaintiff was illegally deprived of his seniority rights. As to whether seniority rights that arise from a collective-bargaining agreement vest immutable property rights, courts from other jurisdictions, so far as we are able to learn, uniformly hold that "collective bargaining agreements do not create a permanent status, give an indefinite tenure, or extend rights created and arising under the contract, beyond its life, when it has been terminated in accordance with its provisions." System Federation No. 59 &amp;c. v. Louisiana &amp; A. Ry. Co., 119 Fed. 2d 509, 515 (certiorari den. 314 U.S. 656).</div><div class="casepar">Seniority arises only out of contract or statute. An employee has "no inherent right to seniority in service." Ryan v. New York Central R. Co., 267 Mich. 202, 208 (255 N. W. 365); Casey v. Brotherhood, 197 Minn. 189, 192 (266 N. W. 737); Trailmobile Co. v. Whirls, 331 U. S. 40, 45 (67 Sup. Ct. 982, 91 L. ed. 1328).</div><div class="casepar">"Seniority among railway workers is fundamentally and wholly contractual, does not arise from mere employment, and is not an inherent, natural, or constitutional right." Colbert v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 206 Fed. 2d 9 (2). See also Pellicer v. Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks, 217 Fed. 2d 205.</div><div class="casepar">The cases relied upon by the plaintiff in error are distinguishable, in that they involve the violation or misapplication of an existing bargaining agreement, as by preferring an employee with less seniority over another with greater seniority, where the employee is still in service of the employer under the contract, and such violation of the agreement deprives the employee of his seniority rights. Such seniority rights, which are property rights, will be protected in the courts. Evans v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., <span class="casemissing">191 Ga. 395</span> (12 S. E. 2d 611).</div><div class="casepar">Next, the agreement does not, as contended, discriminate against any special class or minority, that is, in favor of the younger men as against the older, but equally affects all persons covered by the agreement. Each conductor will be affected at a different time, but all will be affected the same, that is, when each reaches 70 years of age.</div><div class="casepar">The Railway Labor Act imposes upon the bargaining representative of a craft the duty to act fairly in behalf of all those for whom they act without hostile discrimination against them. "This does not mean that the statutory representative of a craft is barred from making contracts which may have unfavorable effects on some of the members of the craft represented. Variations in the terms of the contract based on differences relevant to the authorized purposes of the contract in conditions to which they are to be applied, such as differences in seniority, the type of work performed, the competence and skill with which it is performed, are within the scope of the bargaining representation of a craft, all of whose members are not identical in their interest or merit." Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co., 323 U. S. 192, 203 (65 Sup. Ct. 226, 89 L. ed. 173). The Railway Labor Act provides that employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives chosen by them, and the majority of any craft have the right to determine who shall represent them. 45 U. S. C. A.  152. It is conceded here that the defendant union was the authorized bargaining representative of the plaintiff's craft.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff could not, therefore, complain that the contract was discriminatory because conductors were forced to retire at 70 where engineers were not. Engineers are in a different craft, represented by a different bargaining representative and operating under a different contract.</div><div class="casepar">Next, the subject matter of the agreement--compulsory retirement at age 70 years--is a proper object of collective bargaining. Goodin v. Clinchfield Railroad Co., 125 Fed. Supp. 441 (supra); McMullans v. Kansas, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf Ry. Co., 129 Fed. Supp. 157 (supra); Inland Steel Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 170 Fed. 2d 247, 252 (12 A. L. R. 2d 240); National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 309 U. S. 350, 360 (60 Sup. Ct. 569, 84 L. ed. 799).</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff relies upon the case of Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton, 295 U. S. 330 (55 Sup. Ct. 758, 79 L. ed. 1468). However, that case is distinguishable, in that there the court held that Congress did not have the authority to pass compulsory retirement legislation. Here the question is the right of private parties to contract as to compulsory retirement upon reaching a certain age. We know of no inhibition against that.</div><div class="casepar">Next, there is no merit in the contention of the plaintiff that the defendant union, which admittedly represented him in the original bargaining agreement of 1937, as revised in 1940, and in the amendment of February 3, 1955, did not bind him by the latter agreement because, in entering into the agreement, it violated its charter and by-laws and executed the agreement without complying with the same. The plaintiff's pleadings did not charge notice to the railroad of such alleged violation; and the railroad in dealing with the union--plaintiff's bargaining agent, was under no duty to look beyond the fact that it had been certified as such pursuant to the terms of the Railway Labor Act, and was not required to examine into the specific authority of the agent, as such authority might be affected by the by-laws and charter of the collective-bargaining agent. Order of Railway Conductors v. Gorman, 133 Fed. 2d 273; Childers v. Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, 192 Fed. 2d 956.</div><div class="casepar">It was held in Day v. L. &amp; N. R. Co., 295 Ky. 679 (175 S. W. 2d 347), that members of a trade union as between themselves may agree to the procedure to be followed in authorizing agents of a union to agree to specific contracts, but as between members and an employer, members cannot question the specific authority of their own bargaining agent; after a contract has been entered into between a trade union and an employer, the court may not determine whether the procedure agreed upon among members in respect to specific authority of a bargaining agent has been followed.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed on both the main and cross-bills of exceptions.
