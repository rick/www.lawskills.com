Before Judge Moore. Fulton Superior Court. August 2, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">HEAD, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in holding that the priority of the deed to secure debt was waived by the grantee as to the liens subsequently recorded against the described property.</div><div class="casepar">This case originated on the petition of W. M. Parham, a materialman, praying for the foreclosure of his lien on described property, a special lien on the property, the appointment of a receiver, the enjoining of two foreclosure sales by the holders of deeds to secure debt, the enjoining of other claimants, and other relief. It was asserted that: The property described had been sold by J. W. Harris to H. E. Bailey, and Bailey had executed a deed to secure debt to Harris, securing an indebtedness of $2,400. Bailey had also executed a deed to secure debt to Central Builders Supply Co., Inc. This corporation later executed a quitclaim deed to N. B. Estes, another materialman, conveying one-half of the property. The petitioner is a plumbing contractor and furnished materials for the improvement of the property at a contract price of $1,250. He filed his claim of lien for the materials furnished within 90 days from the completion of thee work, and no part of the indebtedness due him has been paid. H. E. Bailey is insolvent. Other named persons have furnished materials and labor for the improvement of the property and have filed claims of liens. The deed to secure debt from Bailey to Harris recited: "Permission is hereby granted for purchaser to begin construction of two houses on this property as soon as suitable financing can be arranged." By this written permission granted, Harris co-operated with Bailey in the improvement of the land and was active and instrumental in having the real estate improved, and the liens of the petitioner and other materialmen are superior to the claim of Harris. Although he has no power of sale to any land less than the whole of that conveyed in the deed to secure debt from Bailey to him, Harris is advertising the east one-half of the property for sale on a given date. Estes is advertising the west one-half of the property for sale on the same date. Such foreclosure proceedings will result in the sale of the property for a sum less than its market value, the property will be exposed to sale to persons having no actual notice of the priority of the materialmen who have filed their claims of liens. It will avoid a multiplicity of suits to have this sale enjoined and to have the property sold by a receiver and the proceeds of the sale distributed to the persons nailed in the present action in accordance with their respective priorities.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants named in the petition for injunction and receiver were the holders of the deeds to secure debt, the transferee, N. B. Estes, and the other lienholders. Various demurrers, motions to dismiss, and answers were filed by the defendants. On the interlocutory hearing the trial judge appointed a receiver to take charge of the property and procure sales of the two houses built thereon. The receiver obtained bidders, and the trial judge approved the sales of the two houses. The petitioner and the defendants filed their claims to the fund deposited in court. Harris renewed his motion to strike the petition for injunction and receivership. The trial judge entered an order finding that the indebtedness represented by the deed to secure debt to Central Builders &amp; Supply Co., Inc., constituted a first lien on the property, and directed that the receiver pay the amount of this indebtedness out of the fund in his hands. The motion to strike filed by Harris and all other demurrers were overruled. The receiver filed his report as to the sums received from the sale of the property, the disbursements made to N. B. Estes and Central Builders Supply Co., Inc., the expenses of receivership, the funds remaining in his hands, and the claims made against the funds. He prayed that a determination be made as to the priority of the claims to the remaining funds. The judge set the matter for hearing on the priority of the claims, and the case was heard by him without the intervention of a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence, J. W. Harris filed a motion for directed verdict for the amount of his claim, plus interest. The judge denied this motion and held that the claims of the petitioner, Parham, and other materialmen, had priority over the claim of Harris under his deed to secure debt. Harris filed his motion for new trial on the general grounds, which was amended by the addition of special grounds in which he asserted that the court erred in overruling specified grounds of the motion for directed verdict, and in entering the order in favor of the materialmen.</div><div class="casepar">J. W. Harris brought his bill of exceptions to this court assigning error upon "all the rulings of the court" and the denial of his motion for directed verdict and motion for new trial, as amended.</div><div class="casepar"> The record in this case contains a formidable mass of pleadings and orders, and many legal questions might be considered. However, since the litigants have agreed as to the sole question for consideration by this court, we will confine ourselves to this question. The plaintiff in error in his brief states: "Plaintiff in error contends that the sole question for decision is the respective priority of claims of materialmen, on the one hand, and of the priority of a loan deed on the other, to the proceeds of the sale of real estate in the hands of the receiver." In the brief of W. M. Parham, defendant in error, it is stated: "The sole question is whether or not, under the facts above stated and appearing in the record, the laborers and materialmen have priority."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant in error asserts in his brief that the question of priority raised by the plaintiff in error has been adjudicated by the overruling of his renewed motion to strike, and that this ruling has become the law of the case because there is no exception thereto in the bill of exceptions. The exception to "all the rulings of the court", appearing after the recital as to the order denying the renewed motion to strike, is sufficient to prevent the question of priority of claims being settled by the law of the case.</div><div class="casepar">The petition for injunction and receivership, as amended, was sufficient to authorize a court of equity to grant such prayers, and the trial court's action in granting an injunction and appointing a receiver (retaining the question of the priority of claims to the funds realized by the sale of the property), is affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">The deed to secure debt from Bailey to Harris was executed May 9, 1955, and recorded August 26, 1955. It contained the language: "Permission is hereby granted for purchaser to begin construction of two houses on this property as soon as suitable financing can be arranged." The claim of lien of W. M. Parham was recorded October 10, 1955; those of C. M. Howard, November 9, 1955; that of Harold F. and Fred C. Haynes, September 22, 1955; and that of N. B. Estes, October 15, 1955. No question can thus be made as to any notice of the liens of the materialmen by the holder of the security deed at the time of the execution of the deed, and the only question is whether or not the holder of the security deed waived his right to insist on the priority of his deed.</div><div class="casepar">It is the general rule that: "Where title to real estate is conveyed by duly recorded deed to secure debt, and the grantee takes the deed and advances the money loaned, without notice of a materialman's claim of lien upon the property, and before the record thereof, the title thus acquired is superior to such lien." Picklesimer v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. 600 (1)</span> (139 S. E. 72), and cases cited.</div><div class="casepar">In the briefs of both parties the legal arguments in regard to the priority of liens are centered around the case of Williams v. Brewton, <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 164 (3)</span> (152 S. E. 441), in which it was held: "Where the owner of land conveys it to another by warranty deed, and simultaneously takes from the purchaser a deed to secure the purchase-money, in which security deed the vendor in the deed first mentioned agrees that the vendee-purchaser shall have the right to place a permanent loan on the land conveyed and on a house to be erected thereon, not to exceed sixty per cent of the appraised value of said house and lot, and further agrees that said vendee shall have the right to place a payroll loan on said lot not to exceed $1,500, the owner of the lot (vendor in the first deed) in these circumstances consents to the improvement of the real estate by the purchaser, thus impliedly authorizes it, thus co-operates with the purchaser in its improvement, and is active and instrumental in having the real estate improved; and in such circumstances the liens of laborers for work done, and of materialmen for material furnished, in the improvement of the real estate are superior to the vendor's claim for the purchase-money secured by the deed of the purchaser."</div><div class="casepar">There were two dissents in Williams v. Brewton, supra. This case was reviewed in Georgia State Savings Assn. v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">189 Ga. 21</span>, 29 (5 S. E. 2d 14), which was concurred in by all the Justices. It was held in the latter case that the rulings of the former case would not be extended, and it was stated: "We apprehend that many vacant lots are sold, with a part payment down, a deed to the purchaser executed, and a security deed to the vendor for the balance of the purchase-price, when the vendor knows that a dwelling is to be erected thereon. It is not uncommon to specify in the deed the character and minimum cost of the contemplated building. In such case it could be said that the vendor authorized the purchaser to make improvements thereon; but this is not enough to place the claim of a materialman above the rights of the holder of the security deed."</div><div class="casepar">In Rutland Contracting Co. v. Sallie E. Gay Estate, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 468</span>, 471 (18 S. E. 2d 835), which involved the priorities of the liens of the holder of a deed to secure debt and materialmen who had furnished materials for the improvement of the property, it was said: "The knowledge of the owner that the improvements were being made, and failure to object to the same, affords no ground for giving a lien upon the land."</div><div class="casepar">The oral testimony shows no conduct on the part of the security deed holder which would preclude him from asserting his lien as being superior to the liens of the materialmen.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge erred in ruling that the liens of the materialmen were superior to the lien of Harris, the holder of the deed to secure debt.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Northcutt &amp; Edwards, James A. Wofford, Preston L.
