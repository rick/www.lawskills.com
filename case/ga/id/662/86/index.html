Ware Superior Court. Before Judge Hodges.</div><div class="casepresiding">JORDAN, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The evidence in this case did not authorize a finding that the plaintiff was crossing the street within a statutory crosswalk when he was struck by the defendant's automobile, and, consequently, it was error for the trial court to give in charge to the jury the provisions of Code Ann.  68-1656 (a).</div><div class="casepar">This was a suit by the plaintiff to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him when he was struck by an automobile operated by the defendant as the plaintiff was attempting to walk across Nicholls Street in the City of Waycross, shortly before dawn on the morning of January 16, 1962. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the trial court denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. The exception is to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar">1. Error is assigned in special ground 2 of the amended motion for new trial on the following excerpt from the charge of the court: "I charge you, lady and gentlemen of the jury, that when traffic control signals are not in place, or not in operation, the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right of way, slowing down or stopping if need be to so yield, to a pedestrian crossing -- the roadway within a crosswalk when the pedestrian is upon the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling, or when the pedestrian is approaching so closely from the opposite half of the roadway as to be in danger; but no pedestrian shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle which is so close that it is impossible for the driver to yield."</div><div class="casepar">It is contended that this charge, which embodied the provisions of Code Ann.  68-1656 (a), was erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant since it authorized the jury to find that the plaintiff had the right of way as a pedestrian crossing a street within a statutory crosswalk when the evidence did not show the presence of a crosswalk within the area of the crossing where the plaintiff was struck by the defendant's automobile.</div><div class="casepar">Since it is undisputed that there was no marked crosswalk on Nicholls Street within the area of the crossing, the determination of this issue must turn on the question of whether or not a finding was authorized under the evidence in this case that the plaintiff was crossing Nicholls Street at the time of the occurrence within a statutory unmarked crosswalk. If such finding was not authorized, then the giving of the charge complained of would clearly constitute prejudicial error as erroneously warranting the jury to conclude that the plaintiff had the right of way under the provisions of Code Ann.  68-1656 (a) at the time he was struck by the defendant's automobile.</div><div class="casepar">An unmarked crosswalk is defined in Code Ann.  68-1504 (3) (a) as: "That part of a roadway at an intersection included within the connections of the lateral lines of the sidewalks on opposite sides of the highway measured from the curbs, or in the absence of curbs from the edges of the traversable roadway." Under this definition the essential elements necessary for the presence of an unmarked crosswalk are (1) an intersection of public streets or highways (See Code Ann.  68-1504 (1) (a, c), (2) (a), for the definition of "street", "highway", "roadway", and "intersection") ; and (2) the presence of sidewalks on opposite sides of the streets or highways at such intersection, the lateral lines of which may be connected to form the unmarked crosswalk.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence in this case disclosed that the plaintiff was struck by the defendant's automobile at a point near the center of Nicholls Street and approximately 10 feet south of the intersection of Nicholls Street and a "dirt street" or "driveway" which entered Nicholls Street from a northeasterly direction and terminated. There was no evidence that this "driveway" or "dirt street" entering Nicholls Street was publicly maintained, nor was there evidence showing the presence of sidewalks on either side of such street or driveway. But assuming that this was an intersection of public streets and that there were sidewalks on either or both sides of such street, there could be no unmarked crosswalk here according to the definition set forth in the Code.</div><div class="casepar">This definition implies that an unmarked crosswalk can exist only if a street's sidewalk is intersected and continues on after such intersection. Otherwise, there can be no "connection of the lateral lines of the sidewalks on opposite sides of the highway," as is the case when there is only a "T", or variated "T" type intersection as here involved. Where there is this type intersection, the sidewalk terminates at such intersection, and no crosswalk exists unless it is marked as such.</div><div class="casepar">This conclusion had been reached by other courts in jurisdictions where the definition of an unmarked crosswalk is identical with the language of our statute, Langlois v. Rees, 10 Utah 2d 272 (351 P2d 638), and Martin v. Harrison, 182 Ore. 121 (186 P2d 534), and to hold otherwise would render incapable of ascertainment the external imaginary lines of the unmarked crosswalk by either the motorist or the pedestrian. See St. George v. Lollis, 209 Minn. 322 (296 NW 523).</div><div class="casepar">Under these circumstances, it was error for the court to give in charge to the jury the provisions of Code Ann.  68-1656 (a), and thus improperly authorize the jury to conclude that the plaintiff had the right of way as a pedestrian crossing the street within a statutory crosswalk; and such error requires the grant of a new trial under the facts and circumstances of this case.</div><div class="casepar">2. The remaining special ground assigned error on the following excerpt from the charge of the court: "I charge you that where there is an accident and a pedestrian is hit by an automobile which, at the time, is being operated on its left side of the load, the prescription is against the driver of the automobile."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff contends that this charge was correct as an abstract principle of law, and that if the defendant considered the charge incomplete or desired additional instructions, he should have requested them. While the language of the charge complained of may be found in at least two opinions of this court, see Eubanks v. Mullis, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 728</span>, 731 (<span class="casemissing">181 SE 604</span>), and Jackson v. Crimer, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 18</span>, 24 (<span class="casemissing">24 SE2d 603</span>), in which the court stated: "It has been held that where there is an accident and a pedestrian is hit by an automobile which at the time is being operated on its left side of the road, the presumption is against the driver of the automobile", the correctness of this charge as an abstract principle of law has not been directly ruled upon; nor has judicial scrutiny been given to the criticisms lodged against said charge in the defendant's assignments of error relied upon here. In McGee v. Young, <span class="casemissing">132 Ga. 606 (4)</span>, 608 (<span class="casemissing">64 SE 689</span>), which is the authority cited and relied upon by the court in the Eubanks and Jackson cases in support of the statement referred to above, the following charge was attacked by the defendant on the ground that the evidence did not authorize a finding that he was on the wrong side of the road: "If a collision takes place and a party is on the wrong side of the road, the presumption is generally against the party on the wrong side of the road. This applies to whichever of the parties in this case you may find, if either, was upon the wrong side of the road." The court in ruling on this ground in the McGee case specifically pointed out that the accuracy of said charge as a legal proposition was not questioned by the assignment of error and held that since the evidence showed that the plaintiff and not the defendant was on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision, the charge was beneficial and not harmful to the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">In the present case, however, the evidence did show that at least some part of the defendant's automobile was on its left side of the roadway at the time the plaintiff was struck; and in our opinion the charge complained of was subject to the criticism that the jury might assume under said charge that the "presumption" referred to therein was one of absolute liability and that upon proof of the defendant's automobile being on the wrong side of the roadway, a verdict would ipso facto be demanded for the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">This, of course, is not the law, for as stated by the Supreme Court in Chenall v. Palmer Brick Co., <span class="casemissing">117 Ga. 106</span>, 108 (<span class="casemissing">43 SE 443</span>): "There is no absolute presumption of negligence in any case under our law." Even where an act constitutes negligence as a matter of law as being in violation of a duty created by statute or valid municipal ordinance, the commission of the act would not raise a presumption of liability against the negligent party for it must further be shown that said act was the proximate cause of the alleged injury.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court in this case gave to the jury the provisions of Code Ann.  68-1633, which provide that upon roadways of sufficient width a vehicle shall be driven upon the right half of the roadway, with certain exceptions (none of which were applicable to this case), and under the evidence adduced on the trial it would have been proper for the court to have instructed the jury that the violation of the duty imposed by this Code section would constitute negligence as a matter of law, along with cautionary instructions as to proximate cause. The charge complained of, however, was, in our opinion, subject to the attack that it was confusing and misleading to the jury, and should not be repeated on the subsequent trial of this case.</div><div class="casepar">3. The general grounds of the motion for new trial have been abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. Nichols, P.
