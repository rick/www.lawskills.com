Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Langham.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Carter (defendants) for the alleged wrongful repossession of her automobile. Defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint and the parties filed opposing motions for summary judgment. The evidence, construed in a light which most favorably supports plaintiff's claims, reveals the following:</div><div class="casepar">On June 28, 1986, plaintiff financed and purchased a new car through an automobile dealership and committed the vehicle as collateral under a retail installment contract ("the loan agreement") assigned to Anchor Bank. The loan agreement calls for sixty consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $366.19, prescribes a late charge of five percent on any payment more than ten days overdue, prohibits plaintiff from moving the collateral without the lender's prior written consent and requires plaintiff to insure the vehicle "with comprehensive, fire and theft, and a minimum amount of deductible collision insurance satisfactory to [the lender], endorsed to protect [the lender] with a licensed insurance company." The loan agreement also provides that "[the lender] can waive or delay enforcing any of [its] rights without losing them."</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff tendered all 60 monthly payments as required under the loan agreement and maintained the required comprehensive, fire, theft and collision coverage on the vehicle during the entire life of the loan. The only time plaintiff tendered a monthly payment beyond the ten-day grace period prescribed in the loan agreement was in the early part of 1989 when Anchor Bank closed its Marietta Street office (where plaintiff hand-delivered her payments) and posted an inaccurate address for customers to mail loan payments. This confusion was clarified and plaintiff thereafter posted her monthly payments to an address in Chamblee, Georgia, as she was directed by an agent for Anchor Bank.</div><div class="casepar">In December 1988, plaintiff notified a teller at Anchor Bank's Marietta Street office that she changed her residence on November 22, 1988, from the address designated on the loan agreement to an address in Atlanta, Georgia. The teller responded by (apparently) entering plaintiff's new address into Anchor Bank's computer records. However, the teller did not give plaintiff written authorization to move the collateral as required by the loan agreement and Anchor Bank never forwarded such authorization to plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">Anchor Bank posted a form notice, dated March 16, 1989, to the address listed on the loan agreement reminding plaintiff of the need for insurance covering the collateral and warning plaintiff that failure to confirm the existence of such insurance within 15 days of the date of the notice would result in procurement of a policy covering Anchor Bank's interest in the vehicle ("forced placed policy") at plaintiff's expense. Plaintiff never received this notice as she no longer resided at the address provided on the loan agreement. As a consequence, Anchor Bank purchased a forced placed policy covering its interest in the vehicle from February 11, 1989 to February 11, 1990, and charged the premium cost ($1,284) to plaintiff's loan account.</div><div class="casepar">In December 1989, plaintiff's insurance carrier settled a claim for damage to the plaintiff's vehicle and issued a check in the amount of $1,358.77 to plaintiff and Anchor Bank as loss-payees. Both plaintiff and Anchor Bank endorsed the insurance check and tendered it to the automobile dealership where plaintiff's car was repaired. Despite this proof of insurance, Anchor Bank purchased another forced placed policy covering the vehicle from February 11, 1990 to February 11, 1991, and charged the premium to plaintiff's loan account, bringing the total balance for the forced placed insurance to $2,378. However, Anchor Bank did not demand reimbursement of the cost of these policies immediately. It waited until after plaintiff paid off her loan in July 1991.</div><div class="casepar">Anchor Bank posted correspondence, dated August 14, 1991, to plaintiff's former address demanding either proof that the vehicle was insured during the terms of the forced placed policies (between February 11, 1989 and February 11, 1991) or payment of the premiums paid for the forced placed policies. This letter required a response within 15 days from the date on the letter and included Anchor Bank's promise that proof of such insurance would result in a credit to plaintiff's loan account for the full cost of the forced placed insurance. Plaintiff never received this notice.</div><div class="casepar">On September 13, 1991, Anchor Bank posted a notice to the address listed on the loan agreement demanding payment of amounts which appear to reflect the cost of the forced placed insurance. On September 16, 1991, Anchor Bank posted another notice to the address listed on the loan agreement demanding payment of an amount which appears to reflect the cost of the forced placed policies, plus a $73.20 late charge Anchor Bank claims plaintiff owes as a result of a delinquent payment during the term of the loan. A third notice demanding immediate payment of the same amount was mailed to plaintiff's former address on September 25, 1991. When plaintiff did not respond to these notices, Anchor Bank contracted for Omni to repossess plaintiff's car. Omni enlisted James L. Carter to carry out the task.</div><div class="casepar">At 5:00 in the morning on October 11, 1991, Carter went with two other men to plaintiff's home in Atlanta to seize the collateral. Plaintiff was (apparently) aroused from sleep by the activities of Carter and his associates and confronted the men outside her home. Plaintiff informed the strangers that they had no right to seize her car and showed Carter proof that she paid the car loan off in July 1991. Carter informed plaintiff that the car was being repossessed for lack of insurance. Plaintiff then showed Carter proof that she maintained insurance on the vehicle during the entire life of the loan. Nonetheless, Carter refused to leave plaintiff's premises, explaining that it was his job to seize her car.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff telephoned for police assistance and attempted to move the vehicle from her driveway and into her garage. However, Carter's associates stepped in front of the garage door, blocking her way. Plaintiff then ordered the men to remove themselves from her path. The strangers complied and warned plaintiff that she would be committing an illegal act if she refused to relinquish control of the car. Plaintiff then heard Carter inform his associates that they would have to remove the car by force, i.e., towing.</div><div class="casepar">A law enforcement officer later arrived on the scene and examined Carter's repossession papers. The officer informed plaintiff that Carter had authority to repossess the car and instructed plaintiff to turn her car keys over to Carter. Plaintiff complied and Carter took possession of the vehicle, delivering it to Southern State's place of business where it was prepared for auction.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiff contacted Michael Cerase, an agent for Anchor Bank, on the day the car was repossessed and Cerase informed plaintiff that her car would not be returned. That same day, Cerase posted a letter to plaintiff's former address informing plaintiff that her car would be sold at a private sale on October 21, 1991, if she did not pay an amount which appears to reflect the cost of the forced placed insurance plus a $73.20 late charge Anchor Bank claims plaintiff owes as a result of a delinquent payment during the term of the loan. However, this threat was never carried out and plaintiff's car was returned to her by Southern States five days after repossession upon the direction of Anchor Bank. On October 22, 1991, Anchor Bank posted a notice to plaintiff's former address congratulating her "on the successful completion of payments on [her] loan."</div><div class="casepar">The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' motions for summary judgment. This appeal followed. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. Defendants have filed a motion to remand the case sub judice to the trial court, pointing out that a transcript of the summary judgment hearing is not included in the appellate record as requested by plaintiff in her notice of appeal.</div><div class="casepar">In the notice of appeal, plaintiff's attorney directed "[t]he Clerk [of the trial court] to omit nothing from the record on appeal" and augmented this directive via the following handwritten insertion: "The summary judgment hearing transcript should be included." Over two months later, plaintiff's attorney posted (in pertinent part) the following letter to a deputy clerk of the trial court: "Please remit the record on the above-styled case to the Georgia Court of Appeals. There is no transcript to forward with the record in this case." The clerk of the trial court transmitted "the original Notice of Appeal together with a true copy of those portions of the record required to be transmitted to the Court of Appeals of Georgia. . . ." After the case was docketed in the Court of Appeals, defendants jointly filed a motion to remand the appeal to the trial court, arguing the case sub judice is premature because of plaintiff's failure to have the summary judgment hearing transcript prepared and filed for inclusion in the record on appeal.</div><div class="casepar">Defendants fail to point to any specific evidentiary material or admission adduced at the summary judgment hearing which could have possibly supported or detracted from the trial court's ruling on summary judgment. On the other hand, plaintiff contends no such evidentiary material or admission was adduced during the summary judgment hearing and that argument of counsel was all that was accomplished at the hearing. Our examination of the parties' (multi-faceted) briefs in the case sub judice, the ten-volume record (comprising multiple depositions, affidavits and evidentiary filings) and the trial court clerk's certificate that she complied with plaintiff's directive to omit nothing from the record on appeal indicates that all pertinent material before the trial court upon the parties' opposing motions for summary judgment is now before this court on appeal. Consequently, "[w]e do not consider the transcript necessary to our disposition of this appeal from a grant of summary judgment. If defendant[s] as appellee[s] considered the transcript necessary, [they] could have had it prepared and sent to us . . . , see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/41/index.html">5-6-41</a></span> and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/42/index.html">5-6-42</a></span>, or moved to compel plaintiff to do so." Johnson v. Hardwick, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/57/index.html">212 Ga. App. 44</a></span>, 46 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/57/index.html">441 SE2d 450</a></span>). Remanding the case sub judice to the trial court would only serve to delay adjudication of plaintiff's appeal. Accordingly, defendants' joint motion to remand is denied.</div><div class="casepar">2. Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment, arguing that genuine issues of material fact remain as to her claim for breach of the peace.</div><div class="casepar">" '(I)f collateral, such as a car, is on the streets or in a parking lot, no breach of peace will occur if the secured party takes it without protest or out of the presence of the debtor.' Callaghan, Uniform Commercial Code Series,  9-503:03, p. 559. [However, the unequivocal oral protest of the defaulting debtor eliminates] self-help repossession [as] a lawful alternative for the secured party. See Callaghan, supra,  9-503:03 at p. 559. (Of course, whether a protest was made and if so made whether it is unequivocal, generally are questions for jury resolution.) . . . See Fish v. State, <span class="casemissing">124 Ga. 416 (52 SE 737)</span>; see also Williams v. State, <span class="casemissing">105 Ga. 608 (31 SE 738)</span>; cf. Deavers [v. Standridge, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../550/65/index.html">144 Ga. App. 673</a></span>, 674 (1), 675, supra,] (declining to hold that the jury was unauthorized to find a breach of the peace notwithstanding the evidence 'was not strong')." Hopkins v. First Union Bank of Savannah, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/67/index.html">193 Ga. App. 109</a></span>, 110 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/67/index.html">387 SE2d 144</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, defendants Anchor Bank, Omni and Carter contend there was no breach of the peace because Carter and his associates were polite, unabusive and unprofane at the time of repossession. Defendants Omni and Carter also argue that no breach of the peace occurred because plaintiff voluntarily relinquished her car keys at the time of repossession These arguments are without merit. It is not the function of this court (or the trial court) to resolve whether the acts of Carter and his associates constituted a breach of the peace. We review only the sufficiency of the evidence. Hill v. Fed. Employees Credit Union, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/34/index.html">193 Ga. App. 44</a></span>, 46 (2d) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/34/index.html">386 SE2d 874</a></span>). From this perspective, we find the circumstances of plaintiff's resistance to seizure of her automobile at the time of repossession sufficient to authorize a finding that Carter and his associates breached the peace while repossessing plaintiff's automobile. Hopkins v. First Union Bank of Savannah, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/67/index.html">193 Ga. App. 109</a></span>, 110 (1), supra. The fact that Carter and his associates may have been polite, unabusive and unprofane does not diminish the possibility that a jury may find that defendant Carter and his associates posed an intimidating presence during the early morning encounter with plaintiff and that their refusal to yield to plaintiff's resistance cultivated a hostile environment which could have led to a breach of the peace. Further, it can hardly be said that plaintiff voluntarily relinquished possession of her vehicle at the time of repossession.</div><div class="casepar">While consent to repossession may be a valid defense to a claim of wrongful repossession (Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code,  9-503:24), such consent must be voluntary and freely given. See Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code,  9-503:21. In the case sub judice, plaintiff testified that she gave up possession of her vehicle only after a law enforcement officer ordered her to do so. This evidence would authorize a finding that plaintiff did not freely and voluntarily relinquish possession of her car at the time of repossession The trial court erred in finding that genuine issues of material fact do not remain as to plaintiff's claim for breach of the peace.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Anchor Bank contends it is not responsible for any breach of the peace, arguing that repossession of plaintiff's car was carried out by independent contractors who were acting outside the scope of its direction and control.</div><div class="casepar">In Dietrich v. Trust Co. Bank of Augusta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../417/62/index.html">179 Ga. App. 330 (346 SE2d 107)</a></span>, this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of a bank for alleged wrongful repossession, reasoning that the bank was not responsible for any breach of the peace because the agent who seized the automobile was an independent contractor. However, this two-judge decision is physical precedent only and is not binding in the case sub judice. Court of Appeals Rule 35 (b). See Southern Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mason, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../302/46/index.html">213 Ga. App. 584</a></span>, 587, n. 2 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../302/46/index.html">445 SE2d 569</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The general rule that an employer is not ordinarily liable for tortious acts committed by an independent contractor has important exceptions. For example, an employer may generally not delegate the manner of performance of duties imposed by contract, ordinance or statute. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/2/5/index.html">51-2-5</a></span> (3), (4). See Wilson &amp; Brother v. White, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. 506</span>, hn. 1a; Campbell Coal Co. v. White, <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 283 (1) (78 SE 1009)</span>. This basic maxim is enunciated in the Restatement of the Law of Torts, Second,  425 (1965) and was recently enforced in Gaffney v. EQK Realty Investors, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../302/73/index.html">213 Ga. App. 653</a></span>, 655 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../302/73/index.html">445 SE2d 771</a></span>), where this court held that a landlord may not contractually avoid duties imposed by law (relating to the safety of a public elevator) via delegation of those duties to an independent contractor. In Gaffney, this court reasoned that public policy forbids such a waiver or release when the duty imposed is " 'one in which the public has an interest. . . .' " Central of Ga. R. Co. v. Lippman, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 665</span>, 680 (2) (<span class="casemissing">36 SE 202</span>). Gaffney v. EQK Realty Investors, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../302/73/index.html">213 Ga. App. 653</a></span>, 655, supra.</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, the relevant public policy is found in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/11/9/503/index.html">11-9-503</a></span>, prohibiting self-help repossession if there is threat of violence, injury or intimidation during repossession. Hopkins v. First Union Bank of Savannah, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/67/index.html">193 Ga. App. 109</a></span>, 110 (1), supra. We will not diminish this sound public policy by relieving a repossessing creditor of liability simply because the creditor employs an independent contractor to carry out the task of repossession. This holding is consistent with the view held by the Alabama Supreme Court in Gen. Finance Corp. v. Smith, 505 S2d 1045, where a secured creditor was held liable for a breach of the peace committed by an independent contractor employed to carry out a repossession. If we adopted the view of Dietrich v. Trust Co. Bank of Augusta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../417/62/index.html">179 Ga.

Allen Parker Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../631/62/index.html">119 Ga. App. 813</a></span>, 817 (4), 818, supra. In the case sub judice, the trial court found three separate events of default under the loan agreement authorizing repossession of plaintiff's automobile, i.e., plaintiff was in default for (a) failing to name defendant Anchor Bank as a loss-payee under the motor vehicle liability insurance policies covering the vehicle during the term of the loan, (b) failing to notify defendant Anchor Bank of her change of address during the term of the loan and (c) failing to pay a $73.20 fee which allegedly accrued as a result of a late payment in 1989. Plaintiff challenges this finding, arguing that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the issue of a bona fide event of default which justified repossession of her vehicle. Plaintiff also argues (under another enumeration of error) that genuine issues of material fact remain as to Anchor Bank's waiver of the loan agreement's anti-waiver provision.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Failure to Name Anchor Bank as a Loss-Payee. The loan agreement required plaintiff to insure the vehicle "with comprehensive, fire and theft, and a minimum amount of deductible collision insurance satisfactory to [the lender], endorsed to protect [the lender] with a licensed insurance company." Although plaintiff complied with this provision by maintaining the required insurance coverage on her vehicle during the entire term of the loan, she failed to have Anchor Bank endorsed as a loss-payee on her policies of insurance. However, it can hardly be said that this omission constituted a bona fide event of default authorizing repossession of plaintiff's car since it is undisputed that Anchor Bank did not base repossession of the collateral on the fact that it was not named as a loss-payee under plaintiff's motor vehicle liability insurance policies. In fact, the record shows that Anchor Bank did not even know it was not named as a loss-payee until after plaintiff instituted this action. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> It thus follows that Anchor Bank may not defend plaintiff's claim of wrongful repossession on an issue of default it did not rely on as a basis of repossession and which in no way is connected to the cause of repossession. Crosson v. Lancaster, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/67/index.html">207 Ga. App. 404</a></span>, 405 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/67/index.html">427 SE2d 864</a></span>). Such a rule is justified on public policy grounds as well as estoppel principles. To say otherwise, would allow creditors to exercise self-help repossession without any real incentive to investigate the basis for repossession (i.e., the existence of a bona fide event of default) and would expose vendees, once in technical default, to perpetual risk of loss of goods via repossession without the benefit of preventive recourse. See Pierce v. Leasing Intl., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../557/04/index.html">142 Ga. App. 371</a></span>, 372 (2), 373 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../557/04/index.html">235 SE2d 752</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court recognized in its summary judgment order that, in response to an interrogatory soliciting the reason the collateral was repossessed, Anchor Bank responded: " 'Failure to maintain proper insurance on the vehicle. Plaintiff was in default for failure to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage to this defendant, the lien holder.' " <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> These grounds provide no basis (i.e., bona fide events of default) for repossessing plaintiff's vehicle. First, it is undisputed that plaintiff properly insured the vehicle during the entire term of the loan agreement. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> Second, the loan agreement did not require plaintiff to provide Anchor Bank with proof that the vehicle was insured "with comprehensive, fire and theft, and a minimum amount of deductible collision insurance satisfactory to [the lender], endorsed to protect [the lender] with a licensed insurance company." Nonetheless, the parties hotly contest (and the trial court resolved) the issue of whether plaintiff informed Anchor Bank of her change of address during the term of the loan agreement. This dispute seems to be the heart of Anchor Bank's defense to plaintiff's claim of wrongful repossession and appears to be a valid condition of default under the provision in the loan agreement requiring plaintiff not to remove the collateral from the address listed on the loan agreement without the lender's prior written consent. The trial court erred in finding that plaintiff's failure to name Anchor Bank as a loss-payee was a bona fide event of default justifying repossession of the collateral.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Change of Address. The loan agreement provides that plaintiff is not to remove the collateral from the address listed on the loan agreement without the lender's prior written consent. We read this provision (as did the trial court and the parties) to mean that plaintiff must inform the lender of any change of address during the term of the loan agreement. It follows that, upon such notice of plaintiff's change of address without prior written consent, the lender would have the option of acting on the default by repossessing the collateral or providing written consent for plaintiff to move the collateral from the address listed in the loan agreement. A third option is the lender's acquiescence via failure to respond to plaintiff's notice that the collateral has been (or is going to be) relocated. Such acquiescence may amount to a waiver of the loan agreement's "prior written consent" and anti-waiver provisions. A jury is authorized to find such waivers when there is proof that a lender knowingly accepted the risk caused by the default and failed to insist on strict adherence to the terms of the security agreement.

In the case sub judice, plaintiff testified that she informed a teller at Anchor Bank of her change of address within two weeks after moving her residence from the address listed on the loan agreement and that the teller (apparently) entered this information on Anchor Bank's computer records. Plaintiff also testified that she posted her payments to Anchor Bank's agent in Chamblee using envelopes bearing her new home address; that she gave her new address to an Anchor Bank telephone attendant via a long distance telephone call to New York during the early part of 1989 (after Anchor Bank closed banking operations in Georgia) and that Anchor Bank mailed an interest statement to her new address in the early part of 1989 in response to plaintiff's request for information necessary for preparing her 1988 federal income tax return. This testimony and other evidence raises genuine issues of material fact as to whether plaintiff properly notified Anchor Bank of her change of address and whether Anchor Bank acquiesced to plaintiff's relocation of the collateral, thereby waiving the loan agreement's anti-waiver provision.

Plaintiff explained that Anchor Bank later notified her that the car payment was past due, that she owed a five percent late charge as a consequence of the delinquent payment and that all future payments should be mailed to Anchor Bank's agent in Chamblee, Georgia.
