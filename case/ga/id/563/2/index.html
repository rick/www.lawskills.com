Whitfield Superior Court. Before Judge Temples.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Appellant Dennis Laron Williams was indicted for the February 1983 and May 1984 felony murders of his infant sons, Richard and Jacob Williams. Williams was found guilty of each murder and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> He appeals, and we affirm.</div><div class="casepar">Both children died of head injuries. At trial, Dr. Brent Morris, a pediatrician who treated the children, testified that x-rays of Richard showed that he had suffered two rib fractures several weeks before his death. He said that the most likely mechanism of injury was a blow to the baby's side with a blunt object. In addition, Richard had suffered severe brain damage, which in Dr. Morris' opinion was caused by an "acceleration/deceleration injury" that was consistent with violent shaking of the infant.</div><div class="casepar">As to Jacob, Dr. Morris testified that x-rays had revealed two lower leg fractures which had been caused by a torsional force. The fractures were less than a week old. Like Richard, Jacob had suffered severe brain injury resulting from an acceleration/deceleration injury consistent with a violent shaking. It was Dr. Morris' opinion that the injuries to Richard and Jacob had been caused by intentional abuse.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Walter Boehm, a neurosurgeon who treated Richard, opined that his eye and brain injuries were consistent with abuse and mistreatment by shaking.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. James Metcalfe, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on Richard. He testified that the infant's broken ribs could have been caused by a blow to the chest or by a fall on a protruding object. Richard's brain injury could have been caused, according to Dr. Metcalfe, either by a fall on the head, a blow or blows to the head, or a shaking of the head.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Fred Gregg, an ophthalmologist, examined Jacob and found blood inside his eyes. He testified that this type of injury was consistent with an adult abusing the child by shaking.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Floyd James, a pathologist, performed an autopsy upon Jacob's body. He was of the opinion that Jacob's brain injury had resulted from an acceleration/deceleration type injury.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant made several pretrial statements to investigators. Taken in sum, they contained his admissions that Richard had been injured while the appellant was babysitting. Williams said that Richard had been crying, and he had spanked the baby until he stopped breathing.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant made similar admissions regarding Jacob's death. As with Richard, he said Jacob had cried while he was babysitting. Williams had shaken the infant to quiet him, whereupon the baby had stopped breathing and gone limp.</div><div class="casepar">1. When considered in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence submitted at trial was sufficient to enable any rational trier of the facts to find Williams guilty of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 433 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">2. Williams contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance of trial of the felony murders. He argues that the offenses were joined only because they were similar, and that he was therefore entitled to severance. We disagree. Where joinder is based upon a series of acts connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan, severance lies within the discretion of the trial judge. Cooper v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../629/1/index.html">253 Ga. 736 (3) (325 SE2d 137) (1985)</a></span>; Williams v. State, <span class="casemissing">251 Ga. 749</span>, 804 (16) (<span class="casemissing">312 SE2d 40</span>) (1983).</div><div class="casepar">In this case two brothers of approximately the same age died within a fifteen-month period of similar injuries inflicted by their father under similar circumstances. The similarity of the two murders clearly reached the level of a pattern of fatal child abuse. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever the offenses for trial.</div><div class="casepar">3. Williams contends his pretrial statements to police investigators were not freely and voluntarily made, and that the court therefore erred in admitting them into evidence. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">Before the court allowed the introduction of the statements, it held a hearing pursuant to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (84 SC 1774, 12 LE2d 908) (1964), and determined, based on the evidence presented by the state (Williams offered no evidence during the Jackson v. Denno hearing), that Williams had been advised of his Miranda rights, that he had knowingly and intelligently waived them, and that thereafter he had voluntarily made his statements.</div><div class="casepar">There is evidence to support the trial court's ruling. In reviewing Jackson v. Denno decisions, factual determinations by the trial court will be accepted unless the findings are shown to be clearly erroneous. Berry v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../584/3/index.html">254 Ga. 101 (1) (326 SE2d 748) (1985)</a></span>. We find no error.</div><div class="casepar">4. In his third enumeration of error Williams contends that the court erroneously admitted two photographs into evidence. One of the photographs, state's exhibit 16, depicted a small child in a hospital bed, attached to and surrounded by various pieces of medical equipment. The other photograph, state's exhibit 18, was a close-up of the same scene.</div><div class="casepar">During the trial the following dialogue took place concerning these photographs:</div><div class="casepar">"Q All right. Let me show you what's been marked as State's Exhibits 16, 17, and 18, and ask you if you can identify that setting particularly in the pictures? <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">"A These are pictures of a baby in the pediatric intensive care unit at T. C. Thompson Children's Hospital.</div><div class="casepar">"MR. HARRISON: Your Honor, we would move the admission of 16, 17, and 18.</div><div class="casepar">"THE COURT: Any objections?</div><div class="casepar">"MR. BROWN: Yes, Your Honor. He just said they're pictures of a baby. There's been no identity of who the pictures are, or anything, for admission into evidence.</div><div class="casepar">"THE COURT: All right. Lay the foundation.</div><div class="casepar">"Q If you would, look at that picture again and tell me if you're able to determine the child that it is a picture of?</div><div class="casepar">"A I didn't take these pictures, so I can't state specifically that these are pictures of Jacob, although I believe they are pictures of Jacob. But I wasn't there when they were taken, so I can't state categorically that these are pictures of Jacob.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Does that appear to be --</div><div class="casepar">"A This appears to be Jacob and this is the pediatric -- I'm sure this is the pediatric intensive care unit and this is bed 3. I know that unit very well, so I have no question about that. I just can't say whether this is Jacob or Richard.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Based on your not taking the picture?</div><div class="casepar">"A Well, based on the fact also that this is either Jacob or Richard, and I don't know what the date of these pictures was.</div><div class="casepar">"MR. HARRISON: Your Honor, I think that would be sufficient foundation.</div><div class="casepar">"THE COURT: Sustain the objection.</div><div class="casepar">"Q All right, let me show you State's Exhibit 16 --</div><div class="casepar">"MR. BROWN: May I see it before you show it to the witness, please?</div><div class="casepar">"MR. HARRISON: Same pictures.</div><div class="casepar">"MR. BROWN: Your Honor, you've already sustained my objection.</div><div class="casepar">"MR. HARRISON: Your Honor, I'll use them for a different purpose if I can lay the foundation.</div><div class="casepar">"THE COURT: Go ahead.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Did you describe that as bed 3 in the pediatric intensive care unit?</div><div class="casepar">"A Yes sir.</div><div class="casepar">"Q All right, now, that is what the setting would be in the hospital in the care of a child such as Richard or Jacob?</div><div class="casepar">"A Yes sir.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Would that depict the monitors and the apparatus used to treat a child that would be in such a hospital?</div><div class="casepar">"A Correct.</div><div class="casepar">"Q All right. Was Jacob and Richard in such a setting?</div><div class="casepar">"A Yes sir. This is either Jacob or Richard, I just don't know which one, because the two babies were so similar in appearance.</div><div class="casepar">"Q All right, State's Exhibit 18. Is that a fair and accurate representation of a ventilating apparatus on a child who had been treated in your care --</div><div class="casepar">"MR. BROWN: Your Honor, this is all totally irrelevant to the case we're here to try. I'm going to renew my objection.</div><div class="casepar">"THE COURT: Overrule your objection. He says it was one of them so I'll admit it.</div><div class="casepar">"Q That's the breathing apparatus?</div><div class="casepar">"A Yes sir.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Now, what is the function of such apparatus?</div><div class="casepar">"A The function of such an apparatus is to provide breathing for someone who either has inadequate lung function or who is unable to breathe on their own.</div><div class="casepar">"Q Now, that would be the situation in both infants, Jacob and Richard, they were unable to breathe by themselves?</div><div class="casepar">"A Yes sir."</div><div class="casepar">Appellant contends that these photographs were inadmissible because the state did not show that the authenticating witness, Dr. Brent Morris, was present when the photographs were taken. However, we find no error. It was "not necessary that the authenticating witness be the photographer or even have been present at the scene when the photograph was taken. Toler v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/83/index.html">213 Ga. 12</a></span> [3] (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/83/index.html">96 SE2d 593</a></span>) (1957)." Craft v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../514/28/index.html">154 Ga. App. 682</a></span>, 684 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../514/28/index.html">269 SE2d 490</a></span>) (1980).</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, these grounds were not raised in the trial court. Appellant's failure to make a timely and specific objection constituted a waiver. Seabrooks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../664/7/index.html">251 Ga. 564 (1) (308 SE2d 160) (1983)</a></span>; Muff v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../582/6/index.html">254 Ga. 45</a></span> (2a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../582/6/index.html">326 SE2d 454</a></span>) (1985).</div><div class="casepar">Appellant also complains that the state did not establish the exact identity of the child in the photographs. As we explain below, we find that under the circumstances of this case it was not necessary to specify whether the child in the photographs was Richard or Jacob. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> It is the trial court's function to decide in the exercise of its discretion whether or not a photograph is a fair and accurate representation of the scene sought to be depicted, City Council of Augusta v. Lee, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/55/index.html">153 Ga. App. 94 (4) (264 SE2d 683) (1980)</a></span>, and unless manifestly abused the exercise of that discretion will not be controlled by this court, Collins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../744/6/index.html">248 Ga. 687 (2) (286 SE2d 8) (1982)</a></span>. In this case the two photographs were offered to depict the setting in which the children had been hospitalized. The testimony of Dr. Morris was adequate to establish that the photographs truly and accurately represented the room and its equipment per se. His testimony also established that the appearance of the baby in the shots did not differ discernibly from either of the brothers as they lay in the intensive care unit. Therefore, it was of no moment that Dr. Morris could not say whether the child was Richard or Jacob, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting state's exhibits 16 and 18. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Stephen A.

      Williams was indicted on June 4, 1984. The sentence was entered on August 31, 1984. The motion for new trial was filed on September 28, 1984, was heard on March 14, 1985, and was denied on March 18, 1985. Notice of appeal was filed April 15, 1985, and the transcript was certified by the court reporter on April 23, 1985. The appeal was docketed in this court on May 14, 1985, and argued on June 26, 1985.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      State's exhibit 17 was not admitted into evidence.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      Although Williams has not carried forward on appeal his objection that the photographs were irrelevant, we note in passing that they were relevant to aid the jury in visualizing testimony regarding the nature of the medical treatment which was administered to the children in the pediatric intensive care unit and the sequence of events leading up to their deaths.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      Although we affirm the admission of these exhibits, we are compelled to emphasize that we would have been presented with a very different question if the baby in the photographs had been wholly unidentified. In that event the photographs could have been inflammatory and misleading. Cf. City Council of Augusta v. Lee, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/55/index.html">153 Ga. App. 94</a></span>, supra, holding it was not an abuse of discretion to exclude a posed motion picture from evidence where the movie was substantially different from the facts of that case.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Richie L.
