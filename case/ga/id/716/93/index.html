The judgment of the trial court, having sustained certain grounds of a motion to dismiss the answer of the respondent, and being unexcepted to, became the law of the case that the answer was subject to be dismissed for the reasons set forth in said motion. It follows that the subsequent judgment of the trial court dismissing the answer was without error. Since, under the law of this State governing money rules, it is the duty of the trial court in the absence of an answer of the respondent to make the rule absolute, and since, after dismissal, there was no answer in this proceeding, the trial court did not err in entering the judgment making the rule absolute here.</div><div class="casepar">2. There is nothing in the record to show that the trial judge entering the final judgment in this case was without jurisdiction and, since judges of the superior courts have jurisdiction of money rules, this assignment of error is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. Error, to be reversible, must be shown to be harmful. Without deciding whether or not it was error for the trial court to overrule the motion for a continuance in this case, this assignment of error is without merit because the record does not disclose any harm suffered by the respondent by reason thereof.</div><div class="casepar">4. Since the answer of the respondent was properly stricken, the judgment making the rule absolute was demanded. Therefore the over-ruling of the respondent's special demurrers to the original motion for the money rule, if error, was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">5. The introduction in evidence of the affidavit and the demand of movant is in accordance with Code  24-207 and was therefore not improper.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant in error, hereinafter referred to as the movant, filed a motion in the Superior Court of Fulton County against the plaintiff in error, hereinafter referred to as the respondent, for a money rule under Chapter 24-2 of the Code of Georgia. For a more detailed statement of the case see Aiken v. Richardson, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. App. 591</span> (56 S. E. 2d, 782), wherein it is held that the application for the rule is not subject to general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">The respondent interposed certain special demurrers to the application for the money rule of the movant which were overruled on June 19, 1950. To this order the respondent preserved exceptions pendente lite and assigns error thereon in his bill of exceptions. In the meantime, the respondent had filed an answer as contemplated by Code  24-210. Thereafter, on June 21, 1949, the movant moved to strike the respondent's answer, which motion, in toto, is as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Comes now William Richardson and moves that respondent's answer be stricken and that a rule absolute issue for the following reasons: (1) Said answer sets forth no issuable defense. (2) Defendant has made no accounting, although he admits receipt of $3,425.00 paid to him in settlement of movant's claim. (3) Said answer is vague, indefinite, uncertain, evasive and self-contradictory. (4) Said answer does not itemize the expenses averred to have been advanced by respondent in paragraphs 19 and 20 nor show when, to whom or for what such payments were made. (5) Said answer does not set forth any vouchers in support of expenses averred to have been advanced by respondent in paragraphs 19 and 20 as required by law. (6) Said answer shows no reason why said rule should not be made absolute.</div><div class="casepar">"Wherefore, movant prays that respondent's answer be stricken and that a rule absolute be issued against respondent."</div><div class="casepar">This motion continued to pend until renewed by another motion on October 5, 1950, as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Comes now William Richardson and renews his motion to strike respondent's answer as heretofore filed and moves that the respondent's answer as heretofore amended be stricken and that a rule absolute be issued against respondent."</div><div class="casepar">Pursuant to these motions the trial court on October 23, 1950, entered an order thereon as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"William Richardson's motion to strike respondent's answer in the above stated case coming on for a hearing and after hearing argument it is ordered that the grounds set forth in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of said motion be and the same are hereby sustained. The grounds set forth in paragraphs 1 and 6 of said motion are hereby overruled. The respondent is hereby allowed ten days within which to amend his answer."</div><div class="casepar">The answer of the respondent was not amended. in accord with this order, but respondent preserved exceptions pendente lite thereon. However, no exceptions appear to this order in the bill of exceptions. On November 3, 1950, respondent having failed to amend his petition within ten days from the date of the order sustaining certain grounds of the motion to strike respondent's answer as hereinbefore set forth, movant filed a motion to strike the answer of respondent as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Comes now William Richardson, plaintiff in the above styled case, and respectfully shows: (1) That a motion to strike the answer of the defendant was filed and renewed to the defendant's answer as amended, and, after argument, said motion to strike was sustained upon grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof, by order of this court entered on October 23, 1950, and the defendant was given the right to amend within a period of ten days from the date of said order. (2) The time allowed for the defendant to amend under the terms of said order has now expired, and no amendment has been filed or tendered by said defendant. Wherefore, plaintiff moves the court that an order be entered striking and dismissing the response of said defendant, and that a rule absolute be entered against said defendant upon plaintiff's original motion for money rule as heretofore amended." This motion was set for hearing on November 8, and, having come on for hearing on that date, respondent moved to continue on grounds as follows: that his leading counsel and associate counsel were, upon his information and belief, prevented from being present because of other important court engagements made before notice of the hearing in this case; that he could not safely go to trial without them, and expected their services at the next term of court. The continuance on these grounds was requested for a thirty-day period, and the court granted a continuance for a nine-day period, or until November 17. Exceptions pendente lite were duly preserved to this order, and error is assigned thereon. The respondent further urged in the form of an oral motion his oral contention that the judge presiding over this hearing, Judge Andrews, did not have jurisdiction of said case "for the reason that he was the Presiding Judge of the Second Civil Division of Fulton Superior Court for the November term, 1950, and under the rules of said court and its regularly published order of business for said term, the judge presiding in the non-jury division of said court for said term had jurisdiction to entertain said motion." This contention was also overruled, exceptions pendente lite preserved thereto, and error assigned thereon. Error is assigned on exceptions pendente lite in the bill of exceptions upon the admission in evidence against the respondent of an affidavit regarding the service of a letter of demand upon him previously to the application for money rule, at the hearing on November 17, together with a copy of the letter referred to therein, on the grounds that the original letter was not accounted for, that the demand is excessive, and that there is no prayer for the 20% interest referred to therein in the original application for the money rule. Error is also assigned in the bill of exceptions upon an order of the court dated November 17, 1950, striking respondent's answer as amended and an order of the same day making the rule absolute, which order is as follows: "The response of G. Seals Aiken as amended to the motion of William Richardson for a money rule against him having been stricken, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that said motion for a money rule be, and the same is hereby, made absolute and the said G. Seals Aiken is hereby required and ordered to pay over to the said William Richardson or his attorneys of record the sum of $2189.38, together with 20% per annum upon said sum from May 23, 1949, until paid, together with the sum of $-------- costs."</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) Proceedings on money rules are controlled by chapter 24-2 of the Code of Georgia, providing that a judge of the superior court, upon application, may grant a rule nisi containing a full statement of the case in which the officer is called upon to show cause; that in answer to this rule the officer ruled shall fully respond in writing and under oath; that thereafter the movant of the rule may traverse the truth of such answer and, when such traverse is filed, an issue is joined which shall be tried before a jury. Rules against officers of the court for breaches of duty are sui generis, and are governed more largely by the discretion of the court in each particular case than by the technical rules of ordinary procedure. Hixon v. Callaway, <span class="casemissing">2 Ga. App. 678</span> (58 S. E. 1120). While there is no express statutory provision for motions in the nature of general demurrers to strike and dismiss the respondent's answer, nevertheless, such motion may be made. Wilkins v. Jordan, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 119</span> (177 S. E. 344); Reynolds v. Howard, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 349 (3)</span> (38 S. E. 849); Read Phosphate Co. v. Weichselbaum Co., <span class="casemissing">1 Ga. App. 420 (1)</span> (58 S. E. 122).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court sustained several grounds of the motion to dismiss, one of them being that the answer was vague, indefinite, uncertain, evasive and self-contradictory. Exceptions pendente lite were taken to this portion of the order; however, nowhere in the bill of exceptions is error assigned either on the exceptions pendente lite or on the order of the court sustaining these grounds of the motion. Code  24-210 provides in part as follows: "The officer called on by rule nisi, as provided in the preceding section, shall fully respond in writing to said rule, which answer shall be under oath taken at the time the answer is filed; and if the answer is not denied, the rule shall be discharged, or made absolute, according as the court may deem the answer sufficient or not." Italics ours.</div><div class="casepar">The discretion of the trial court to hold that an answer is evasive and insufficient for this reason is recognized in Willis v. Powell, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. 476</span> wherein it is held as follows: "The court may have deemed the answer of the sheriff evasive and insufficient and for that reason made the rule absolute. We find nothing in this record that will authorize this court to control the discretion of the court below in making the rule absolute and ordering an attachment to issue against the sheriff." See also Wilkins v. Jordan, supra. It may be seen that not only does the very language of the Code section itself authorize the court to examine the answer and determine if the respondent has fully responded, but this authority has been recognized by our appellate courts. It follows therefore that the trial court can find answers to be vague, indefinite and evasive, which answers at the same time contain issuable facts and which answers at the same time, should the trial court exercise his discretion by not striking the same for vagueness or evasiveness, could show reasons why the rule absolute should not be issued. Here the trial court found the answer to contain issues of fact. He also found that the answer contained reasons why the rule should not be made absolute, yet he found the answer subject to be stricken for evasiveness if not amended in this respect. The answer was not amended in this respect and the order finding it subject thereto is not excepted to in the bill of exceptions. Accordingly, the question of whether the trial court abused his discretion in striking the answer for evasiveness is not before this court. It became the law of the case that it was evasive, even though as a matter of fact it may not have been.</div><div class="casepar">Assignments of error must be made in the bill of exceptions in order to present any question for decision. Code  6-901; Parker v. Harling, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 419 (1)</span> (200 S. E. 800); Jett v. Wolfe, <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. App. 155 (3)</span> (42 S. E. 2d, 505). It accordingly became the law of the case that the answer as amended (the motion having been renewed after an amendment thereto by the respondent) was subject to the defects therein stated, and whether or not it may have been so subject in point of fact is a question not presented to this court for decision. The trial court is vested with large discretion in such cases ( Read Phosphate Co. v. Weichselbaum Co., supra) and where, the answer being thus evasive, and the proceeding requiring, under Code  24-210 that he "fully respond," upon his failure to do so the discretion of the trial court in making the rule absolute will not be interfered with. Wilkins v. Jordan, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 119</span>, 121, supra; Albert v. Howell, <span class="casemissing">32 Ga. 548</span>; Willis v. Powell, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. 475</span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in his orders of November 17 in striking the respondent's answer and thereafter entering a rule absolute against him.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is further contended that the orders of November 17 are void because the judge sitting at the hearing did not have jurisdiction of the case. The bill of exceptions and exceptions pendente lite disclose that the hearing was before Hon. A. A. Andrews, who is a judge of the Superior Court of Fulton County, and we are cited to no rule of court under which it would be unlawful for him, rather than another superior court judge of the Atlanta Circuit, to preside over the case. This exception is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. It is contended that the trial court committed reversible error when, on November 8, 1950, he refused to grant a motion for a continuance on behalf of the respondent for a 30-day period, on the ground that leading counsel and associate counsel were engaged in the trial of other cases. The court did grant a continuance for nine days, and no further motion was urged at that time for a further continuance. It does not therefore appear that the respondent was harmed, since he was granted a continuance and, failed to show, at the expiration of the period of time granted, that he could not safely go to trial. This objection is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">4. Exceptions pendente lite were preserved to the overruling of the respondent's special demurrers to the original motion of the movant, to the first amendment thereto, to the second amendment thereto, and to the third amendment thereto and the motion as amended. As to the first and second amendments, these were subsequently stricken by the movant and have no proper place in the record; accordingly, questions regarding their sufficiency are moot. See Aiken v. Richardson, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. App. 591</span> (56 S. E. 2d, 782). This case also held that the motion as finally amended was not subject to general demurrer. Accordingly, any error in regard to special demurrers thereto is harmless to the defendant under the circumstances of this case, since, after the order striking his answer, as finally amended, he presented no defense whatever and a judgment making the rule absolute was demanded. These exceptions are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, it was not error to receive the affidavit stating the contents of the demand and when and where the original was delivered to the officer.</div><div class="casepar">6. Error is also assigned on various rulings of the court in permitting the traverse to the response, which originally contained a defective verification, to be amended, and in failing to strike the traverse. Where the respondent's answer is so defective as to authorize the court to make the rule absolute, whether or not a traverse is made is immaterial, "since it is only a verified answer, and one that 'shall fully respond . . . to said rule [nisi]' without being vague, uncertain, indefinite, or evasive, which the statute requires to be traversed." Wilkins v. Jordan, supra, at page 121. The questions regarding the sufficiency of the traverse are therefore nugatory.</div><div class="casepar">TOWNSEND, J., concurring specially. Although the professional integrity of the respondent is not in issue in this case, nevertheless attacks have been levied against him both in the pleadings of the movant and in briefs of movant's counsel.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Jones, Williams, Dorsey &amp; Kane, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">G.
