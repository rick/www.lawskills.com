The colloquy between the trial court and the foreman of the jury was not subject to the criticism that it coerced the jury to return a verdict against the defendant, nor were extraneous issues injected into the case by such colloquy.</div><div class="casepar">Roy Smith and his wife, Eula Smith, were indicted in the Superior Court of Paulding County and charged with the wilful and malicious burning of a dwelling of A. P. Wigley which was occupied by Sarah Smith.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence adduced upon the trial was substantially to the following effect: A dwelling house, owned by A. P. Wigley, and occupied by Mrs. Sarah Smith, was burned on the morning of March 8, 1949. Mrs. Sarah Smith was the mother of four children by Johnnie Smith, a brother of Roy Smith. Johnnie Smith had died in Europe during World War II. The defendant Roy Smith was a second beneficiary of his deceased brother under a certain policy of insurance, following the death of their mother. Roy Smith prevented his mother's efforts to give the insurance money to Johnnie Smith's children, forced his attentions upon Mrs. Sarah Smith, and endeavored to control her and her children by occasional payments to Mrs. Smith and the children of the children's share of their grandmother's estate. He revealed his intentions by proposing to Mrs. Sarah Smith that she live with him when he had divorced his wife, Mrs. Eula Smith. This proposal was declined by Mrs. Smith and she, rebelling against his advances and threats, moved away from a dwelling controlled by him and rented the house which is alleged to have been burned by him and Mrs. Eula Smith. Mrs. Sarah Smith was employed as a cook at the New Hope School, the community into which she had moved from Roy Smith's house, and had secured a pension for her children from the Veterans Administration. Roy Smith blamed Mr. Wigley, the owner of the house rented by Sarah Smith, for his loss of control over the Sarah Smith family and continued to harass Mrs. Smith with threats and slander.</div><div class="casepar">Between sundown and dusk on March 7, 1949, Roy Smith went to the home of A. P. Wigley in a drunken condition and said, "Paul, I have come down here to see why you are trying to run my business." Upon Wigley's denial of the statement, he called Wigley a "damned liar" whereupon Wigley struck him and forced him to leave his premises. Leaving the Wigley premises, Smith went to the house occupied by Mrs. Sarah Smith, which was within sight of the Wigley home, driving a Dodge truck with a red cab and lug grip tires. On arriving at the Sarah Smith house, he threatened and was abusive of Mrs. J. W. Maxwell, Mrs. Sarah Smith's mother, saying that he thought he had "run her off." While he was still there Mrs. Sarah Smith returned to her home and Smith began to threaten her and was abusive of Mr. Wigley, saying that he was going to make her move and was going to take her children away from her and send her to the asylum. Mrs. Smith ordered him to leave the premises and Smith profaned her and said, "Yes, you are going to move, all right. I'll put you out and you won't have any home."</div><div class="casepar">The following morning at about seven o'clock Roy Smith and his wife, Mrs. Eula Smith came to the Wigley home and Mrs. Eula Smith asked Wigley why he had attacked her husband the night before. Smith, himself, remained in his truck, parked on the road in front of the Wigley home. Wigley ordered Mrs. Eula Smith to leave his premises and she replied that she would not depart until she had told Wigley what kind of woman he was protecting, meaning Mrs. Sarah Smith.</div><div class="casepar">On the same morning, Mrs. Sarah Smith had cooked breakfast on a wood stove in her kitchen, using splinters from small strips. No other fire was built in the house. She left her house for work about 7:15 a.m., but returned to tell her mother to leave the house and go to the Wigley home. Mrs. Maxwell left the Smith house about 7:45 a.m., and the fire in the kitchen stove had not been replenished after 7 o'clock, and the type of wood used would not burn ordinarily longer than thirty minutes. The stove was in good condition as were the electric lights. There was no lightning that morning. The house was safe when Mrs. Maxwell left it and she fastened the kitchen door by a latch or button from the inside, and locked the front door as she departed.</div><div class="casepar">At approximately 8:30 a.m. Roy Smith and Eula Smith came from the direction of Dallas, Georgia, and turned into the road leading to the house in which Sarah Smith lived and drove up into the back yard. Roy Smith kicked and knocked on the front door of the house but it did not open. He then went to the back door and broke open the door to the kitchen and went into the house. He was followed by his wife a minute or so later. The two were in the house about five minutes and when they came out they engaged in a chase around the wood pile. They seemed to be striking at one another. They then got into the truck and came out the road toward the Wigley house and drove toward New Hope in the opposite direction from Dallas. In about five minutes they came from the direction of New Hope, parked the truck in plain view of the Wigley house, and sat in the truck looking in the direction of Sarah Smith's house. Roy Smith drank something from a bright colored can and after motioning toward the Sarah Smith house, slapped the steering wheel of his truck. After about three minutes they drove the truck into the Wigley driveway to turn around, and drove off in the direction of New Hope. They were seen a few minutes before 9 a.m. passing New Hope and to the road to the Levi Cooper Place. Mrs. J. G. Wigley and Mrs. J. W. Maxwell watched the truck when it was parked in front of the Wigley house and a few minutes after the truck had disappeared from sight the two ladies went onto the porch of the Wigley house and saw smoke billowing from the top of the Sarah Smith house. Mrs. J. G. Wigley ran into the house and into the back yard to tell her mother-in-law, consuming not more than one-half minute and on her return to the front porch the roof of the Sarah Smith house was blazing and fire was coming from the window of the front bedroom where no fire had been.</div><div class="casepar">Roy Smith and Eula Smith were arrested some time in the afternoon of the same day parked on the side of the road near Lost Mountain in Cobb County. Several cans of beer were found in the truck and Roy Smith was so drunk that he was "in no shape to talk."</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict finding Eula Smith not guilty but finding Roy Smith guilty and fixed his punishment at from two to four years in the penitentiary.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant's motion for a new trial, based upon the usual general grounds and four special grounds, was overruled and he excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. "To support a conviction of arson, it is necessary to show that the burning was not due to accidental or providential cause." Sutton v. State, <span class="casemissing">17 Ga. App. 713</span> (88 S. E. 122).</div><div class="casepar">2. " 'It is not often possible to make out a case of arson by direct proof establishing the corpus delicti or showing the connection of the defendant with the commission of the crime, for arson is seldom committed except at an hour when there is small chance that the criminal will be actually observed in the execution of his nefarious purpose, and it is also generally easy to commit the crime by stealth, without the help of an accomplice, without the beating of drums or blare of trumpets or any betraying noises; and therefore circumstances must generally be depended upon not only to show the guilt of the accused, but to establish the corpus delicti. The rule that the circumstances proved should exclude every other reasonable hypothesis save the guilt of the accused should not be relaxed; but it does not follow that the criminal must go unwhipped of justice because absolute proof is not presented by the State. If there be enough shown to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused has been established to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis, and no other reasonable hypothesis is suggested by the evidence, and there is nothing to indicate that the jury failed to accord to the defendant every consideration to which he was entitled, a reviewing court will not arbitrarily say that the conviction should be set aside.' Wade v. State, <span class="casemissing">16 Ga. App. 163</span>, 167 (84 S. E. 593), and see State v. Wenger, 47 Wyom. 401 (38 Pac. 2d, 339), where this language of the Wade case was quoted with approval. 'To sustain a conviction, it is not required that the evidence exclude every possibility or every inference that may be drawn from proved facts. It is only necessary to exclude reasonable inferences and reasonable hypotheses which may be drawn from the evidence under all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular case.' Graves v. State, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. App. 96</span>, 97 (30 S. E. 2d, 212); Smith v. State, <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. 605</span>." Grimes v. State, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 489</span>, 502 (54 S. E. 2d, 302).</div><div class="casepar">3. Applying the foregoing rules to the evidence in the instant case, the jury was authorized to find the defendant, Roy Smith, guilty of arson. There were facts in evidence from which the jury could infer that the origin of the fire was neither accidental nor providential. The only fire kindled in the house on the morning the house was destroyed was built in the kitchen stove. The fuel used was splinters which were ordinarily consumed in about thirty minutes. Mrs. Sarah Smith had built the fire in the kitchen stove, cooked breakfast, and had left the house at about 7:15 a.m. The fire was not replenished after that time. She returned to the house a few minutes later to instruct her mother, Mrs. Maxwell, to go to the Wigley home for the day. Mrs. Maxwell left the house at about 7:45 a.m. The house was not on fire at that time. The stove was in good condition. The electric lights were in good condition. There was no electrical disturbance or lightning on the morning in question. Between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. the house was seen to be on fire and flames were coming from the front bedroom window in which room no fire had been kindled on that morning. From these facts the jury was authorized to infer that the fire was criminal in its origin.</div><div class="casepar">There were also facts from which the jury could infer the defendant's connection with the origin of the fire. The defendant's ill feeling for Mrs. Sarah Smith, the occupant of the house and for Mr. Wigley, the owner of the house was established; and, while the threat was not in itself sufficient, the defendant had threatened to put Mrs. Sarah Smith out so that she would have no place to live. The defendant, together with his wife, was seen to break into and enter the house only a few minutes before the house was discovered to be on fire, and he and his wife were seen after they left the house to park at a vantage point looking and gesticulating in the direction of the house. From these facts, together with the fact that the defendants denied their presence in or near the house on the morning in question, the jury could infer that the defendant set the fire which consumed the house.</div><div class="casepar">4. "Where two persons are jointly indicted for an offense which does not require in its commission the joint act of both, but may be separately committed by either, a verdict finding one of the defendants guilty, if supported by the evidence, would be authorized," even though the other defendant was found not guilty upon the same evidence. Easterling v. State, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. App. 690</span> (78 S. E. 140); Page v. State, <span class="casemissing">23 Ga. App. 548</span> (99 S. E. 55).</div><div class="casepar">5. In special ground 1 of the amended motion for a new trial counsel for the defendant insist that although the following charge was given at their insistence and request, it was erroneous and injurious to the defendant in that it confused the jury as to the burden of proof which the State had to carry in order to authorize the jury to convict the accused, inasmuch as the court had previously charged the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty the jury must do so beyond a reasonable doubt, and the following charge complained of was the last charge given the jury with regard to the burden of proof and the court had previously charged the jury correctly as to the burden of proof which the defendant must carry with reference to his defense of alibi and at the time the court gave this latter charge he did not instruct the jury as to what he was referring to and the jury was misled and confused as to whether it would be authorized to find the defendant guilty if it believed the evidence preponderated toward his guilt or whether it must find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt: "In determining where the preponderance of evidence lies, the jury may consider all the facts and circumstances of the case, the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity for knowing the facts to which they testify, the nature of the facts to which they testify, and the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of interest and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear from the trial. The jury may also consider the number of the witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number." The trial judge made the following notation on this special ground of the motion for a new trial: "Counsel for the defendants requested and insisted that the court give in charge to the jury  38-107 of the Code of 1933." The language upon which error is here assigned is the exact language of Code  38-107, and in view of the court's note to this ground that such charge was requested and insisted upon by counsel for the defendant, there is no merit in this ground. "A party may not complain of an error which he himself invited." Gaskins v. State, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. App. 97 (4)</span> (76 S. E. 777); Brown v. State, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 756 (2)</span> (105 S. E. 289); Caesar v. State, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 710</span> (57 S. E. 66); Hill v. State, <span class="casemissing">147 Ga. 650</span> (95 S. E. 213).</div><div class="casepar">6. In special ground 2, the defendant assigns error upon the following excerpt from the court's charge to the jury upon the ground that it "was erroneous and not sound as an abstract principle of law": "A reasonable doubt, gentlemen, the words 'reasonable doubt' have their ordinary and usual meaning. You would have a reasonable doubt if when you consider all the evidence and the defendant's statements your minds are wavering and uncertain, and if you have that doubt it would be your duty to give the benefit of it to the defendant and to acquit, that is, the defendant that you have such doubt about." This assignment of error raises only the question of whether this language complained of states a principle of law correct in the abstract. Anderson v. Southern Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">107 Ga. 500 (4)</span> (33 S. E. 644). There is no error in this charge which is substantially the language used and approved as stating a correct principle of law in Chancey v. State, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 12 (1)</span> (88 S. E. 205). There is no merit in this ground of the amended motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">7. In special ground 3 error is assigned upon the following excerpt from the court's charge to the jury: "You look to the evidence and see whether or not the property described in this indictment has been burned, and then you look to the evidence and the defendants' statements and determine what the facts are with reference to how it was burned and if anybody burned it, and then determine the guilt or innocence of the defendants upon a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence and all the circumstances that have been admitted for your consideration." The error assigned upon this excerpt is that it amounted to an expression of opinion by the court that the testimony of the witnesses was evidence and separated the defendants' statements from the "evidence," and was erroneous as an invasion of the jury's province to determine what is "evidence" and what is testimony or a statement, and that had the jury chosen to believe the defendants' statements then they would have been "evidence" and the court's charge here complained of prevented the jury from so doing and confused their minds as to the weight they must give the testimony and the defendants' statements. This excerpt from the charge is not subject to the criticism lodged against it. The court gave an adequate charge on the statutory provisions touching the defendants' statements and in this excerpt the trial court was correct in following the admonitory rule of Vaughn v. State, <span class="casemissing">88 Ga. 731</span>, 738 (4) (16 S. E. 64): "The jury trying a criminal case are sworn to give a true verdict according to evidence. It is important for them not to confound the prisoner's statement with the evidence or the evidence with the statement. The statute allows them to give the statement such force as they think proper, and even to believe it in preference to the sworn testimony. In charging them the court should keep the evidence distinct from the statement and shape the general tenor of the charge by the evidence alone and the law applicable to it. For if the court should mingle the evidence and statement together, the jury might find it difficult to separate them and might fail to understand the import of the instructions delivered from the bench." Burke v. State, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. App. 612</span>, 616 (47 S. E. 2d, 116); Booker v. State, <span class="casemissing">183 Ga. 822</span> (190 S. E. 356); Green v. State, <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 290</span> (183 S. E. 204); Harris v. State, <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. App. 300</span> (183 S. E. 107), and citations; Phillips v. State, <span class="casemissing">58 Ga. App. 553</span> (199 S. E. 342).</div><div class="casepar">8. In special ground 4 counsel for the defendant contend that the following colloquy between the trial judge and the foreman of the jury constituted coercion on the part of the judge to force the jury to reach a verdict. Court: "Well, you needn't tell me how you stand. It is 10 o'clock, it is time to quit work I guess. We have no place to send the jury tonight. I have to keep you in the courthouse. Is there any prospect of your making a verdict pretty soon or not?" Foreman: "I don't see any, Judge. We have tried every combination, looks like." Court: "Maybe after a night's rest you can do it. Mr. Sheriff, do you have any place to take them?" Sheriff: "I don't know." Foreman: "Do we have to have a unanimous vote to determine the sentence?" Court: "You can't make a verdict unless all of you agree to it. I wouldn't mind sitting up a little longer if there is any prospect of your making a verdict. You can take charge of the jury and let them stay there as long as they want to, and when they get ready to quit, if they have not made a verdict, get them a place to stay if you can find one in town. Some jury has got to make verdict, and as far as I can tell you are qualified as well as any jury to do that. A man is not expected to give up any conscientious views that he has, but it is your duty to try to reconcile your differences and make a verdict if you can. That's all I can say to you. Do the best you can. I will be back tomorrow at 10 o'clock."</div><div class="casepar">The foregoing colloquy is not subject to the criticism that it coerced the jury into returning a verdict on consideration of matters not in issue, as was the case in Campbell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../726/05/index.html">81 Ga. App. 834</a></span> (60 S. E. 2d, 169), where the court admonished the jury to consider the expense and time for a trial, nor is it subject to the criticism that the court intimated or expressed an opinion in favor of one party as against the other, as was the case in Peavy v. Clemons, <span class="casemissing">10 Ga. App. 507</span> (73 S. E. 756), the cases upon which counsel for the defendant rely.</div><div class="casepar">While it is true the court intimated that there might not be a place for the jury to stay overnight other than in the courthouse and instructed the jury that it was as well qualified as any other to reach a verdict, the court at the same time admonished the jury that no juror was expected to give up any conscientious views that he might have. The court admonished the jury to reconcile the differences but did not intimate that the jurors should in any manner compromise solely for the purpose of reaching an agreement, and we are convinced that under the rulings of the Supreme Court, the colloquy in this case is not reversible error. Yancy v. State, <span class="casemissing">173 Ga. 685</span> (160 S. E. 867); Golatt v. State, <span class="casemissing">130 Ga. 18</span> (60 S. E. 107); Gambo v.
