Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 of the defendants' demurrer were properly sustained, thereby striking irrelevant matter from the petition.</div><div class="casepar">5. In an action brought under Code  85-1003 and 85-1004 by tenants in common to recover their share of the rents and profits from the defendants, who are in possession of the land owned in common, a recovery therefor can be had only up to the time the suit is commenced; and a former action, between the same parties for the rents and profits on the same property, which is still pending, does not abate so much of the present suit as seeks recovery of the plaintiffs' share of the rents and profits accruing since the filing of said former action. Therefore, it was error to overrule the plaintiffs' demurrer to paragraph 4 of the defendants' plea in abatement.</div><div class="casepar">In substance, the petition alleges the following: The plaintiffs are the heirs of H. L. Lankford, and the owners of an undivided half interest in a certain described tract of land in Douglas, Coffee County, Georgia. This tract is the western part of tract four referred to in the title-registration case. On February 19, 1943, the Judge of the Superior Court of Coffee County decreed that title to an undivided half interest in said tract of land be registered in the plaintiffs' names, and that the other undivided half interest be registered in the names of J. H. Milhollin and N. E. Holton. On February 19, 1943, J. H. Milhollin and N. E. Holton were in possession of the land in question, and it is now in the possession of N. E. Holton and Milhollin's executors. Rilza T. Holton and her husband and agent, N. E. Holton, had seized possession of the land in 1924 without title or right of possession, and they and J. H. Milhollin or his executors, whom they later put into possession with N. E. Holton, have held the land ever since, paying nothing for the occupancy and use of the plaintiffs' interest. This seizure of the plaintiffs' interest in the tract was made in bad faith, without legal process, without the consent of Mattie L. Lankford, and with knowledge on the part of Rilza T. Holton and N. E. Holton that they had no right to do so. A few weeks after the decision by the Supreme Court in the land-title-registration case ( Lankford v. Holton, supra), the attorneys for Rilza T. Holton, N. E. Holton, and J. H. Milhollin, who was then living, refused to pay the plaintiffs any amount on account of their past trespasses, and refused to pay any amount for the future use and occupancy of the plaintiffs' undivided half interest in the land. When said counsel were asked by counsel for the plaintiffs whether they would agree for their said clients to pay any amount to the plaintiffs for either past or future occupancy of the plaintiffs' interest, said counsel replied that their clients would not pay the plaintiffs any amount on account of the use of the land unless it was sued out of them. A suit for the rents and profits filed against the defendants on February 19, 1943, has not been tried on account of delay on the part of the defendants. Rilza T. Holton and her agent, N. E. Holton, acting for her, after wilfully seizing possession of the land, put J. H. Milhollin in possession, and they are jointly and severally liable with J. H. Milhollin and his executors for damages or rents and profits which may be adjudicated to be due to the plaintiffs. Because of N. E. Holton's joint occupancy of the plaintiffs' interest with J. H. Milhollin or his executors, N. E. Holton is jointly and severally liable with Milhollin or his executors for any amount that may be adjudicated to be due to the plaintiffs because of said trespasses. The reasonable monthly rental value of the plaintiffs' interest in said land is $100 per month. Because of their deliberately wanton, wilful, and malicious seizure of the plaintiffs' interest in the land, and their continuing trespasses, said defendants are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiffs in the additional amount of $5000 as punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">Attached to the petition were copies of the "settlement contract" of 1923 between Mattie L. Lankford and Rilza T. Holton, the "option contract" delivered by Rilza T. Holton to Mattie L. Lankford in 1923, the final report of the examiner in the land-registration case, and the exceptions, numbered 7 and 8, to findings of law 12 and 13 of the examiner's report.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants demurred to the petition, and all of the demurrers were sustained, except the last paragraph thereof, which was overruled. The defendants also filed a plea in abatement, in which they alleged that the plaintiffs had filed a petition in the Superior Court of Coffee County on August 2, 1947, which was duly served on the same defendants, and which was still pending between the same parties. It was alleged that the former petition referred to and alleged the same facts, so far as the claim for rents and profits and for punitive damages is concerned, as the petition to which the plea was directed, and (paragraph 4) that, under the allegations of the petition in the former suit, if proved, the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover rents and profits up to the time of the trial of that suit. The plaintiffs demurred to paragraph 4 of the plea in abatement, on the ground that the plaintiffs could only recover the rents and punitive damages sued for in the former suit up to the time of filing that suit, on August 2, 1947, and that the plea in abatement is not good, in fact or law, as to rents and punitive damages which have accrued since said date of August 2, 1947. This demurrer was overruled.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs excepted to the judgment sustaining certain of the demurrers to their petition and to the judgment overruling their demurrer to the plea in abatement.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The defendants in error have moved to strike the executors of the will of J. H. Milhollin, and N. E. Holton, as parties defendant to the writ of error, on the ground that the record shows that there has been no final judgment in the trial court as to these defendants in error, and that as to them the case remains pending in the trial court. "All formal parties to the pleadings in the trial court are proper parties to a writ of error." Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Griffith, <span class="casemissing">111 Ga. 551</span> (1 b), (36 S. E. 859). It appears from the record that the parties who ask that their names be stricken from the writ of error were joint defendants with Rilza T. Holton in the court below, and that all the defendants demurred jointly and obtained the judgment here excepted to. The ruling on the demurrers dismissed the case as to Rilza T. Holton and also struck that portion of the suit asserting liability for trespasses and punitive damages against the other defendants. This was a final judgment, and changed the plaintiffs' case, from one brought against three defendants alleged to be jointly and severally liable, to one against two defendants. Under these circumstances, we think it was proper to join all of the defendants in the bill of exceptions. See McGaughey Bros. v. Latham, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. 67 (2)</span>; Kollock v. Webb, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 762</span> (39 S. E. 339); Millers National Ins. Co. v. Hatcher, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 449</span>, 451 (22 S. E. 2d, 99); Smith v. Atlanta Enterprises, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. App. 760</span> (169 S. E. 243). The motion is denied.</div><div class="casepar">2. The first paragraph of the demurrer to the petition goes to that part of the petition seeking to hold Rilza T. Holton liable to the plaintiffs for rents and profits or trespasses, because the petition shows that Rilza T. Holton has not had possession of the land since February 19, 1943. The second paragraph of the demurrer is to the allegations of the petition charging the defendants with being trespassers, because, under the allegations of the petition, they were tenants in common with the plaintiffs after February 19, 1943, and also because, if any trespasses were committed prior to that date, an action therefor would be barred by the statute of limitations.</div><div class="casepar">The second paragraph of the demurrer, in so far as it raises the bar of the statute of limitations to trespasses committed prior to 1943, is well taken, and accomplishes what the first paragraph of the demurrer attempts, namely, to eliminate Rilza T. Holton from the case. The petition shows that she and her husband, N. E. Holton, as her agent, seized possession of the land in question in 1924, and that she claimed title to the whole interest in the land in the registration proceeding, as did N. E. Holton and J. H. Milhollin, who later intervened therein, claiming under Rilza T. Holton. It is not shown when the Holtons put J. H. Milhollin in possession, but it was apparently during the pendency of the title-registration case and prior to 1943 that this was done, and an action for damages based on trespass against Rilza T. Holton would have been barred in four years from the time of the trespass. "All actions for trespass upon or damage to realty shall be brought within four years after the right of action accrues." Code,  3-1001. This limitation applies to a count for mesne profits which is based on the action of trespass ( Lopez v. Downing, <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. 120</span>) and it also applies to a nuisance or continuing trespass. Monroe v. McCranie, <span class="casemissing">117 Ga. 890</span> (45 S. E. 246). Whether Rilza T. Holton's possession was that of a trespasser, or of a tenant in common holding adversely to her cotenants, her liability therefor ceased four years after she was no longer in possession or put others in possession. The action for continuing trespasses or for holding adversely as cotenants, prior to 1943, against N. E. Holton and J. H. Milhollin was likewise barred when the present suit was filed in 1950, and this part of the second paragraph of the demurrer was properly sustained.</div><div class="casepar">3. Regardless of what the character of the possession of N. E. Holton and J. H. Milhollin or his executors may have been prior to February 19, 1943, their possession since that time must be considered with regard to the decree in the land-registration case entered on that date, and registering title to an undivided half interest in the land in the plaintiffs and title to a like interest in the defendants, as tenants in common with the plaintiffs. "The obtaining of a decree of registration and the entry of a certificate of title shall be construed as an agreement running with the land, and, except as hereinafter provided, the same shall remain registered land subject to the provisions of this Title." Code,  60-421. "If the fee simple shall be registered undividedly in the name of more than one person, as tenants in common or other like relationship of joint or common interest, it shall not be freed from registration except upon the unanimous action of the owners of the entire fee."  60-422. It was not alleged that the land in question had been freed from registration. "No title to nor right or interest in registered land in derogation of that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession."  60-423. Thus, even though the defendants' possession prior to the date of the registration decree may have been that of trespassers, or of tenants in common who have ousted their cotenants, the registration decree, operating as an agreement running with the land, and preventing the acquisition of title by prescription, imposed upon the defendants as parties to that decree a recognition of their relationship to the plaintiffs as tenants in common. The opinion in the case of Harral v. Wright, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. 484</span>, states: "If Jessup's possession became adverse for a time, that would go for nothing if, before the bar of the statute attached, the possession ceased to be adverse in consequence of his return to duty, as bailee or co-tenant. As often as he resumed the cast-off relation, he would come again under the law of that relation." Although Rilza T. Holton, in 1928, and N. E. Holton and J. H. Milhollin, at some time between 1928 and 1943, claimed the whole interest in the tract in the land-registration proceedings, their claim was ruled invalid in part by the decree entered therein, which was binding upon them.</div><div class="casepar">According to the Code,  85-1005, "There may be no adverse possession against a cotenant until actual ouster, or exclusive possession after demand, or express notice of adverse possession; in any of which events the cotenant may sue at law for his possession," and for injury to his possession, as measured by the rental value or mesne profits of the land. Adams v. Bishop, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. App. 811</span> (157 S. E. 523); Burney v. Arnold, <span class="casemissing">134 Ga. 141</span> (67 S. E. 712).</div><div class="casepar">However, the petition does not show any of the elements set out in Code  85-1005, supra, which would make the defendants' possession since February 19, 1943, that of trespassers rather than simply that of cotenants in exclusive possession. No demand for possession is alleged, although there was an alleged demand for the rents. No ouster or facts amounting to an ouster are shown, and no notice given to the plaintiffs by the defendants as to their adverse possession is alleged. Exclusive possession alone by a cotenant will not be presumed to be an adverse holding, but simply one in support of the common title. Morgan v. Mitchell, <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 596</span> (30 S. E. 792); Green v. Rountree, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 1</span>, 11 (116 S. E. 116).</div><div class="casepar">Without the element of ouster or adverse holding, the plaintiffs may be left to their remedy of accounting, as provided by the Code,  85-1003 and 85-1004; and the trial judge apparently so ruled in overruling the tenth paragraph of the demurrer to the petition, to which order no exception appears to have been taken. However, if the allegations of the petition are insufficient to show that the holding of the land by the defendants since February 19, 1943, was that of trespassers, it likewise shows that the plaintiffs are not entitled to punitive or additional damages to "deter the wrongdoer from repeating the trespass." Code  105-2002.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in sustaining the second and seventh paragraphs of the defendants' demurrer, which went to the allegations charging the defendants as trespassers, since February 19, 1943, and to the allegations that the defendants were liable for punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the demurrer to paragraphs 3 through 26 of the petition, with the exception of paragraphs 7, 8, and 25 of the petition, which were not demurred to, were also properly sustained, as these paragraphs allege occurrences prior to February 19, 1943; and although these allegations may show an ouster of or trespass against the plaintiffs before 1943, such ouster or trespass did not continue, but was interrupted by the title-registration decree entered on February 19, 1943, enforcing a recognition of the plaintiffs' title by the defendants, and so characterizing the defendants' possession as no longer adverse, but in support of the tenancy in common; and any claim by the plaintiffs for damages, on account of such ouster or trespass prior to 1943, is barred by the statute of limitations. Thus said allegations cannot illustrate any issue arising under the allegations of the petition, as contended by the defendants in their demurrers, and paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the demurrer were also properly sustained.</div><div class="casepar">5. The plaintiffs' demurrer to paragraph 4 of the defendants' plea in abatement raises the question of whether the plaintiffs, seeking to recover rents and profits from the defendants, as their tenants in common in possession, may recover their share of the rents to the time of the trial (the former action not having been tried) or only to the time of filing their petition in that case. It is contended by the plaintiffs that their former action, alleged in the plea to have been commenced on August 2, 1947, does not abate so much of their present action as seeks recovery of rents and profits accrued since that date.</div><div class="casepar">"Where the injury sued for is caused by a mere repetition or continuing of acts of the same class, plaintiff's recovery is limited to the damages resulting from such of those acts as were done before the bringing of the suit," and "Where successive actions are brought for a continuing wrong, the damages to be recovered are for the injuries which have occurred during the period covered by the particular action." 25 C. J. S. 908, Damages,  193. Damages sustained by reason of a nuisance which may be abated ( Langley v. Augusta, <span class="casemissing">118 Ga. 590</span>, 45 S. E. 486), or a continuing but not a permanent trespass ( Savannah &amp;c. Canal Co. v. Bourquin, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. 378</span>; Jones v. Lavender, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. 228</span>; Ketron v. Sutton, <span class="casemissing">130 Ga. 539</span>, 541, 61 S. E. 113), are recoverable up to the time of bringing the suit, the reason being that the trespass or nuisance may or may not be continued after the suit is commenced, and if continued, a new cause of action arises therefor. We think that the same rule should apply to the action of a tenant in common for his share of the rents, brought under Code  85-1003 and 85-1004.</div><div class="casepar">While, in an action of ejectment, mesne profits may be recovered up to the time of the final judgment, this exception to the general rule is based on the statutory provision that "No plaintiff in ejectment shall have and maintain a separate action in his behalf for the recovery of mesne profits which may have accrued to him from the premises in dispute." Code,  33-105. See Brown v. Tyson, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 598</span> (104 S. E. 420). Also, the successful plaintiff in a contested dispossessory-warrant proceeding could formerly recover double rent up to the time of the trial ( Sims v. Shotkin, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 68</span>, 27 S. E. 2d, 466; Gaultney v. Adamson, <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. App. 406</span>, 43 S. E. 2d, 778); and now, under the act of 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, p. 657; Code, Ann, Supp.,  61-305), the judgment in such an action may provide for the payment of future double rent until the tenant surrenders possession of the lands, but this is by virtue of the statutory provisions.</div><div class="casepar">It was error to overrule the plaintiffs' demurrer to paragraph 4 of the plea in abatement, setting up the pending suit as an abatement to the action for the recovery of rents and profits accruing after August 2, 1947.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.
