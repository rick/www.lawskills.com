Fulton State Court. Before Judge Joyner.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a Delaware corporation, and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a New York partnership in which the Delaware corporation is a general partner, (referred to as UGTC unless otherwise necessary) appeal from judgments entered against them in these product liability cases, including $25 million in punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">This case had its genesis in a wreck in August 1989 involving the Fords' 1982 van which was equipped with UGTC-produced tires. Mrs. Ford, Jr. had originally purchased two new SP-7000 tires from NTW also named as a defendant, in February 1988. One of the tires was returned to NTW and replaced with a new tire because of a vibration noticed by Mr. Ford, Jr., which NTW attributed to the tire being out of round. In August 1989, while returning from vacation on Interstate 85 with their sons, Frank (Ford III) and Doug, Mr. Ford, Jr., who was driving the van, again noticed an intermittent vibration while they were south of the Atlanta airport. Although the Fords discussed the vibration and possible causes, including a tire problem, they continued their trip. Near the North Druid Hills exit on I-85, they heard two thumps, the second of which caused Mr. Ford, Jr. to have to struggle with the steering wheel to control the van. The left rear tire had ruptured, causing the steel belt to wrap around the rear axle, totally immobilizing the van. Because they were in the third lane, one lane from the median, they did not exit the van, but remained in it while Mr. Ford, Jr. attempted to move the van and call for help on his C.B. radio. Several minutes later, the immobilized van was rammed from behind by a car driven by Parsons, who was killed by the impact. Frank Ford III suffered severe and permanent brain damage and Mrs. Ford a badly fractured leg.</div><div class="casepar">These appeals involve two separate actions which were brought seeking to recover for these injuries. One action (case nos. A95A0468 and A95A0469) was brought against the defendants by Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Jr. for injuries suffered by Mrs. Ford, Jr. in the collision along with Mr. Ford, Jr. 's loss of consortium claim. An identical separate action (case nos. A95A0465 and A95A0466) was filed against the same defendants on behalf of the son, Ford III, for his injuries.</div><div class="casepar">As the dissent correctly points out, although for the wrong reasons, it was error for the trial court to order this procedure over the objection of UGTC. That error, however, does not require reversal in this case.</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to the dissent's conclusion, the trial court's order was not controlled by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a). Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a), which was adopted from Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, governs consolidation of separate cases on the court's docket, or of issues within those cases, for trial before a single jury or trier of fact. This section and its provision that "the court may order a joint hearing or trial . . ." has never been interpreted as authority for ordering simultaneous trials before multiple juries in the same courtroom. See Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, Vol. 9, Ch. 7,  2381, 2382 (1995).</div><div class="casepar">However, the consolidation provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a) do provide guidance in addressing this issue. The primary purpose for consolidating separate actions for trial is the promotion of convenience and judicial economy in cases involving common questions of law and fact. Even in proper cases where judicial economy would be promoted, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a) clearly departs from the otherwise identical provisions of federal Rule 42 (a) by providing that consolidation may be ordered only if the parties consent. Robinson v. Hall, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../423/56/index.html">177 Ga. App. 181 (338 SE2d 699) (1985)</a></span>, disapproved on other grounds, Stenger v. Grimes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../420/5/index.html">260 Ga. 838</a></span>, 839 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../420/5/index.html">400 SE2d 318</a></span>) (1991). Similarly, the simultaneous trial of these actions before two juries, as ordered by the trial court, was prompted solely by considerations of judicial economy. This so-called dual or multiple jury procedure has been approved in numerous criminal cases in other jurisdictions as a means to avoid problems arising under Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (88 SC 1620, 20 LE2d 476) (1968), and other general prejudice problems in joint criminal trials and as an economy measure. See Velez v. State, 596 S2d 1197, 1199-1200 (Fla. App. 3 Dist. 1992); United States v. Hayes, 676 F2d 1359, 1366-1367 (11th Cir. 1982); Smith v. DeRobertis, 758 F2d 1151 (7th Cir. 1985). In one civil case, the trial court ordered the simultaneous use of two juries in a complex air crash case as an economical means to apply the law of two different states to the evidence. Martin v. Bell Helicopter Co., 85 FRD 654 (D. Colo. 1980).</div><div class="casepar">Without condoning its use as an economy measure in a case of this type nor condemning it in general, we conclude that, like consolidation, the procedure should not be forced on any party in a civil case who does not consent to it. Accordingly, the trial court erred by ordering the procedure over the objection of UGTC. Nevertheless, since harm as well as error must be demonstrated to warrant a reversal, it must be shown how the procedure prejudiced the defendants in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants claim that, due to the dual jury procedure, one jury was deprived of continuous access to the blown tire during its deliberations while the tire was being used by the other jury. Even though the tire could not be used by both juries at once, there is nothing in the record showing that this prejudiced the defense. Both juries had access to the tire at one time or another during their deliberations, and there is no indication that either jury requested and was denied access to the tire. Moreover, the defendants made no claim in the trial court that lack of continuous access to the tire by both juries was error.</div><div class="casepar">The defense claim that they were prejudiced by being deprived of the chance to employ different strategies before separate juries in separate trials is unpersuasive. Once again, the defendants did not make this claim during the trial so that the trial judge could consider allowing the presentation of any such defenses to one jury at a time. And the defendants were apparently not concerned with possible conflicting defenses when they moved for consolidation of the two cases for trial before a single jury.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants' allegations of "logistical difficulties" caused by the dual jury procedure, without any detailing of such difficulties or resulting prejudice, present nothing for review.</div><div class="casepar">Lastly, the defendants claim that the inconsistent verdicts reached by the two juries with respect to punitive damages demonstrate that they were prejudiced by the dual jury procedure and require reversal. Although the inconsistency of the two verdicts was perhaps more dramatic because it occurred during the simultaneous trials of both cases, rather than in sequential trials before separate juries, two separate juries hearing the same evidence on the same issue may legally render inconsistent verdicts. Stapleton v. Palmore, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/3/index.html">250 Ga. 259 (297 SE2d 270) (1982)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Since the defendants have not shown they were prejudiced as a result of the dual jury procedure ordered by the trial court, no reversal is required on this ground.</div><div class="casepar">2. UGTC's fourth enumeration alleges that it was reversible error for the trial court to order the addition of new party defendants in both cases three days prior to trial without service of process and over the objections of the added defendants. We concur.</div><div class="casepar">In the case brought on behalf of the son, Ford III, the plaintiffs concede that in October 1990, pursuant to a consent order, the B. F. Goodrich Company was dropped as the defendant and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a partnership ("the partnership" for purposes of this division), was substituted as the party defendant. The plaintiffs also concede that, in the separate action brought by Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Jr., the complaint named Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company as a defendant. The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a Delaware corporation ("the corporation" for purposes of this division), was served with process through its corporate agent.</div><div class="casepar">In granting the plaintiffs' motions to add parties, the trial court concluded that it was perfecting the style of the case and ordered that the corporation be added as a defendant in the action brought on behalf of Ford III and that the partnership be added as a defendant in the action brought by Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Jr. Neither the partnership nor the corporation was separately served with process in the actions to which they were added. Three days later, both cases were simultaneously tried before separate juries, and judgments were subsequently entered against the original and added defendants in both cases.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court's action did not merely perfect the style of the case or correct a misnomer but added new parties to each action. See Northgate Village Apts. v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/97/index.html">207 Ga. App. 479</a></span>, 481 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/97/index.html">428 SE2d 381</a></span>) (1993). The partnership and the corporation were distinct legal entities, neither of which had been previously named as a defendant or served in the actions to which they were added. A new defendant added by motion must be served with process in the usual way even if the added defendant has knowledge of the pending suit. Stone Mountain Aviation v. Rollins Leasing Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../433/23/index.html">174 Ga. App. 35</a></span>, 36 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../433/23/index.html">329 SE2d 247</a></span>) (1985); Charming Shoppes &amp;c. v. Parrish, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../299/57/index.html">214 Ga. App. 729</a></span>, 730-731 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../299/57/index.html">448 SE2d 781</a></span>) (1994). A judgment against added parties is null and void where there has been no valid service or waiver of service. DeJarnette Supply Co. v. F. P. Plaza, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../132/59/index.html">229 Ga. 625 (193 SE2d 852) (1972)</a></span>; see Hap Farms v. Heard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../315/45/index.html">209 Ga. App. 684</a></span>, 685 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../315/45/index.html">434 SE2d 118</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">Here, the added defendants timely objected to the addition without service, so there was no waiver. Id. at 685. Moreover, the record does not support the plaintiffs' claims that the corporation and the partnership waived service by making general appearances in the cases to which they were added or that they otherwise consented to the jurisdiction of the court. Compare Hap Farms, supra at 685-686.</div><div class="casepar">Although the plaintiffs claim that the similarly named corporation and partnership were not always clearly referred to during the litigation as separate entities, it is clear that the entity added as a defendant in the Ford III case was a corporation, not the partnership which had been properly served in that case. Also, the suit as originally filed by Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Jr. was served on a corporation, not the partnership added three days before trial. It was the responsibility of the plaintiffs to conduct an investigation to determine that the proper parties were named and served in each case. "Service on the proper party is the responsibility of the plaintiff, not the [party] accepting service." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Charming Shoppes, supra at 730-731. In fact, the plaintiffs eventually recognized the problem and sought to correct it by adding defendants. However, the required service was never accomplished.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the added defendants are not bound by the judgments entered in the cases in which they were not served. Moreover, since the judgments were joint as against both defendants in each case, including those defendants not served, the judgments are indivisible and must be reversed as to both co-defendants in each case. Knox v. Landers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../486/98/index.html">160 Ga. App. 1</a></span>, 2 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../486/98/index.html">285 SE2d 767</a></span>) (1981); Medlin v. Church, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/13/index.html">157 Ga.

App. 273 (196 SE2d 318) (1973)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. Enumerations 20 and 22 deal with the award of punitive damages of $25 million in the son Franklin Ford III's suit, Case Nos. A95A0465 and A95A0466, and are addressed together. The jury in Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Jr.'s action, Case Nos. A95A0468 and A95A0469, concluded that the defendants were not liable for punitive damages. Since this issue is likely to recur on retrial, we address the punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">This punitive damage award must be reversed for two reasons.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The trial court charged the jury that: "The statutory law of Georgia provides that in a tort case in which the cause of action arises from product liability, 75 percent of any amounts awarded as punitive damages, less a proportionate part of the cost of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be paid into the treasury of the state." UGTC excepted to this charge and contends on appeal that this was error requiring reversal of the punitive damages award.</div><div class="casepar">The charge given was a correct statement of a portion of subsection (e) (2) of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>. "The clearly stated purpose of [OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.11/index.html">51-12-5.11</a></span> is to punish and deter the defendant in a tort action." Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 542 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">436 SE2d 635</a></span>) (1993). Subsections (e) (1) and (2) of the statute carry out this purpose with respect to the imposition of punitive damages in product liability actions and provide in general that, although there is no ceiling on the award of punitive damages, there may be only one such award against a defendant for any act or omission regardless of the number of causes of action that may arise from such act or omission, and that 75 percent of any such award will be paid into the state treasury. In discussing these limitations on the imposition of punitive damages under the statute in Mack Trucks, supra, the Supreme Court observed that they enforce "the legislature's stated intent that the purpose of the statute is to punish the defendant, and not to provide compensation or, in our view, a windfall to an individual plaintiff. Rather, we think that the purpose of this subsection is to authorize punishment of a defendant who has the potential to greatly damage society at large. The statute furthers this purpose by not allowing the first plaintiff to reach the courthouse with a product liability lawsuit to reap a windfall from the punitive damages, but instead requiring that three-quarters of the punitive damages awarded be paid into the state treasury for the benefit of all Georgia citizens. Punishment and deterrence of the defendant being the purposes of the subsection, it is insignificant under the statute that the plaintiff does not receive the full award." (Emphasis supplied.) Id. at 542.</div><div class="casepar">It follows from the above analysis of the purposes of subsections (e) (1) and (2) that the sole concern of the jury under these subsections is to decide what amount of punitive damages will serve to punish and deter the defendant. It is no concern of the jury that the plaintiff will not receive the full award and that 75 percent of the award will be paid into the state treasury for the benefit of all Georgia citizens, including the members of the jury. It matters not a whit that some or all of the jurors may have already known that 75 percent of any award would be paid to the state, as the dissent contends. The point is that this information is not relevant to the jury's consideration of punitive damages. Instructing the jury that the state would receive 75 percent of any punitive damages awarded created a substantial risk that the jury was improperly influenced by this consideration to adjust its award of punitive damages in a manner which prejudiced the defendants.

However, there is no evidence that the SP-7000 tire at issue manufactured under these conditions had ever previously caused an injury. Thus, there is no clear and convincing evidence that UGTC was engaging in any type of "willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences" by which it knowingly placed the plaintiffs or others in danger of the type of accident and serious injuries suffered in this case.

The record shows that on March 17, 1993, NTW entered into a Compromise Release Agreement with Franklin E. Ford III as to all of his claims against NTW. On that same date, NTW and Franklin Ford, Jr. and Claudia Ford entered into a Compromise Release Agreement. In these agreements, plaintiffs agreed to "release and discharge all claims" against NTW. NTW remained in the case, and on September 1, 1993, NTW cross-claimed against UGTC for indemnification. On January 18, 1994, UGTC subsequently cross-claimed against NTW for contribution. On March 10, 1994, the parties filed Dismissals with Prejudice as to both cross-claims. Because of the Compromise Release Agreements releasing NTW from all claims, UGTC and NTW filed a joint motion for dismissal of NTW. The trial court held a hearing on this motion on March 11, 1994. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, basing its opinion on this court's holding in Carney v. JDN Constr. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/23/index.html">206 Ga. App. 785 (426 SE2d 611) (1992)</a></span>. But, the appeal in Carney was the denial of a motion to transfer venue based on the plaintiff's settlement with one of the joint tortfeasors, not whether the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss a party against whom there were no longer any claims pending. See Collipp v. Newman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../290/08/index.html">217 Ga. App. 674 (458 SE2d 701) (1995)</a></span>. Further, the record in Carney shows that the settlement agreement, with the amount of the settlement edited from it, was introduced into evidence at trial. Where parties have entered into a definite settlement agreement, "the trial court should make the agreement the judgment of the court, thereby terminating the litigation." Smith v. Haverty Furniture Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../438/19/index.html">173 Ga. App. 447</a></span>, 448 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../438/19/index.html">326 SE2d 812</a></span>) (1985) (quoting Skinner v.

Further, once the release had been signed, the claims against NTW disappeared and there was no justification for not granting NTW's motion to dismiss when there was no longer any claim or controversy to be decided.</div><div class="casepar">Because the trial court refused to allow the settlement agreement to be introduced as evidence and refused to allow the parties to inform the jury of NTW's true status, the jury was given the mistaken impression that one of the defendants had admitted fault. Therefore, we find alternatively, with regard to UGTC's sixth and seventh enumerations, that if the trial court refused to dismiss NTW, it was error not to introduce the settlement agreement into evidence and allow the parties to inform the jury as to NTW's status in the case. As previously discussed, plaintiffs' counsel was allowed to create the impression that NTW had admitted liability, and this could have served only to unfairly influence the jury as to UGTC's liability.</div><div class="casepar">(b) UGTC's eighth enumeration of error contends that the trial court erred in charging the jury on breach of warranty. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> The claim for breach of warranty was applicable only to the dismissed claim against NTW. There was no breach of warranty claim against UGTC. The warranty charge given by the court was as follows: "Negligence is not an element of breach of warranty. If goods do not conform to the warranty, the seller's utmost care will not relieve him of liability." However, the juries' verdict forms did not provide for a verdict for or against NTW. Each jury returned a verdict solely as to UGTC. The Fords contend that the jury understood that the warranty claim was not against the manufacturer and could lie only against the seller. However, UGTC points out that it was referred to repeatedly as the seller of the tire. Therefore, it is highly probable that the jury applied the charge as to these warranty claims against UGTC. A charge which could confuse the jury as to the contentions of the parties and the real issues in the case is grounds for the granting of a new trial. Overstreet v. Nickelsen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../450/20/index.html">170 Ga.

Here, the charge was clearly confusing as there was no provision for returning a verdict against NTW. The jury could easily have applied this charge to the claims against UGTC, thus allowing plaintiffs to recover against UGTC on a basis not authorized by law. Overstreet, supra; Mitchell, supra. Accordingly, the trial court erred in giving the jury the breach of warranty charge. These errors mandate reversal of both judgments.</div><div class="casepar">5. Enumerations 9 through 11 allege error in the trial court's admission, over objections at trial as well as the denial of a pretrial motion in limine seeking exclusion, of evidence of recall notices of tires other than the SP-7000 (enumerations 9 and 10) and the study done by a UGTC employee of the number of "adjustments" (honored warranty claims) made for tires originating from the Tuscaloosa plant as well as several other plants (enumeration 11).</div><div class="casepar">Under the facts of this case, such evidence should not have been admitted and was highly prejudicial to UGTC, and the motions in limine should have been granted in both cases as follows.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The court's order disposing of the motions in limine ruled regarding the tire recalls: "Granted in part, denied in part. The fact that recalls were issued will not be permitted. However, plaintiffs will be permitted to introduce information contained in such recall memoranda for the limited purposes of impeachment and to establish defendant's UGTC's knowledge that vehicle vibration is symptomatic of impending belt separation." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">Although the tires subject to the recalls were manufactured by UGTC, they were not the SP-7000 tire, which had never been subjected to a recall. The first recall involved 16-inch "Edge" and "Trail Edge" light truck tires, which were of a different load range, size, and category from the 15-inch SP-7000. No showing was made that the tire type was in any way similar, nor was any showing made that the belt or tread separation occurred in a similar fashion.</div><div class="casepar">The second recall was of the "Lifesaver" tire, a passenger tire. Again, there was no showing that the tire was similar to the SP-7000. Further, the defect for which this tire was recalled was a "maldistribution of tread rubber in the shoulder area." There was no evidence that such a maldistribution was in any way involved with the Ford accident or, in fact, had ever occurred in a SP-7000 tire.</div><div class="casepar">"In product liability actions, evidence of other incidents involving the product is admissible, and relevant to the issues of notice of a defect and punitive damages, provided there is a showing of substantial similarity.

Here, the lower blade guards on several saw models were designed and operated similarly by a spring-loaded mechanism, and evidence was produced to show it).</div><div class="casepar">Further aggravating this problem, the court allowed the plaintiffs to redact portions of the unrelated recall letters, removing any reference to "recall." Instead, the two bulletins are completely whited out with the exception of the bulletin numbers, dates, and the following heading: "Very Important Read Immediately! BULLETIN." The first states that "Belt separation may also cause moderate to severe vehicle vibration. Continued operation could cause rapid air loss and vehicle crash." The second states: "Belt edge separation could develop during normal driving conditions and may be noticed by slight to moderate vehicle vibration or the appearance of a bubble in the upper sidewall near the tread. Continued operation could cause rapid air loss and vehicle crash." This second notice had not even been issued when the Fords purchased their tires, the time at which they claim they should have been given notice of the significance of any such vibration.</div><div class="casepar">UGTC offered to stipulate that belt separation in any tire could cause vehicle vibration, which fact was known to UGTC. This stipulation, which would have obviated the need for the proof of this by the recall letters, was rejected. While we do not mean to imply that a party may preclude its opponent from tendering evidence by a stipulation, any such evidence must first be admissible and relevant before allowed.</div><div class="casepar">In such a situation, as in Moseley, supra, the prejudice to the defendants cannot be ignored, particularly when they were precluded from explaining the contexts of the two unrelated notices.</div><div class="casepar">The denial of the motions in limine requires reversal of both judgments.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Also subject to the motion in limine was the "study" conducted by Hudson, a former employee of UGTC. The trial court's order concerning the motion in limine stated that "Plaintiff may introduce evidence consisting of adjustment data and adjustment claim forms based on claims made for the subject tire and the common green tire for belt edge separation and tread separation condition codes only, provided such evidence is based on claims asserted prior to the date of NTW's March 1988 sale of the subject tire. All hearsay shall be redacted from any adjustment claim forms."</div><div class="casepar">Hudson stated that, after the corporate merger of Uniroyal and Goodrich in August 1986, he was asked to do a survey of adjustments made by UGTC. The adjustment center was where tires returned by customers for any reason would be returned by the dealers to UGTC. A form for each tire was also sent. This "adjustment form" contained information supplied by the customer as well as the dealer, including a code number for the type of problem. Hudson had the center put aside tires from all of UGTC's plants, including the Tuscaloosa plant where the Ford tire was made. He then went to the center and examined between 2,000 and 3,000 tires. He counted those tires which had belt separations as well as tread separations. The tires examined included all types of tires produced by UGTC. Hudson could not state that any of the examined tires were, in fact, the SP-7000. Although he was unclear about the time span of the study, he stated that he thought it was done in late 1987 and 1988. The tires examined could have been as old as seven years, or produced as early as 1980, and perhaps a few tires produced in 1989 were included.</div><div class="casepar">Based on this examination, Hudson concluded that the "Tuscaloosa plant . . . produced more separations per volume of built tires than the other plants. Even though [another plant] might have produced more tires, had more separation. The percentage per thousand was more. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">Without question, at a minimum, the evidence allowed in through Hudson's testimony was not in compliance with the court's order. There was no showing made that any of the tires inspected from the Tuscaloosa plant were the SP-7000 or the "common green tire" batch involved. Further, no showing of similarity of the tires, defects, or the causes thereof was made.</div><div class="casepar">"[T]he Supreme Court's holding in Mack Trucks v. Conkle, supra, makes it clear that before such evidence is admissible for whatever appropriate use, there must be a showing of substantial similarity to the incident at issue.

Therefore, this enumeration is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">7. Similarly, the charge not given and addressed in the twenty-first enumeration is addressed.</div><div class="casepar">UGTC contends that the trial court erred in failing to charge on the defense of third-party intervening cause because a defendant who creates a traffic hazard is not the proximate cause of injuries resulting from a third party's negligent failure to avoid the hazard. UGTC contends that Rebecca Parsons, the driver of the station wagon that collided with the Fords' van, qualified as a potential intervening and superseding cause of the injuries suffered by the Fords. Therefore, UGTC concludes that the court erred by not charging the jury on third-party intervening causation and a new trial is required.</div><div class="casepar">The Fords contend that the principle of intervening superseding causation probably does not apply to strict liability cases where liability is not based on negligence, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Pretermitting the issue of whether defendants were prejudiced by the joint proceeding, the trial court's action cannot be condoned.

While I agree with the defendants that much of the evidence supporting the punitive damage award was inadmissible and may have tainted the jury's verdict, I am not able to hold that the issue of punitive damages is altogether precluded. Upon retrial, should the plaintiffs provide clear, convincing, and admissible evidence that defendants, motivated by profit, knowingly endangered those who used or came into contact with their tires, then the issue of punitive damages may be presented to the jury.

With this standard in mind, my review of this enormous record reveals the following.</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs Franklin E. Ford, Jr. ("Mr. Ford") and his wife, Claudia Ford ("Mrs. Ford"), brought this product liability action against defendants The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a Delaware corporation, Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a New York partnership (collectively "Uniroyal Goodrich"), and Automotive Corporation d/b/a NTW, alleging defective tire design, defective tire manufacture, and failure to warn. According to the complaint, the Fords' van became stranded on an interstate highway when a 15-inch radial passenger tire designed and manufactured by Uniroyal Goodrich "exploded, separating between its steel belts[.]" One of the steel belts wrapped around the van's axle and emergency brake cable, immobilizing the van in the second left-hand lane. The van was then struck with great force from the rear by an approaching station wagon, driven by Rebecca Parsons. The impact killed Mrs. Parsons and injured Mrs. Ford and her 22-year-old son, Franklin E. Ford III ("Franklin Ford"). Franklin Ford brought a separate but identical complaint, seeking to recover for permanent brain injuries sustained in this collision. By consent order in the Franklin Ford case, "The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company, a partnership, [was] substituted as the party defendant[, in lieu of the former entity known as The B. F. Goodrich Company, without need of] further service of the Complaint or Answer. . . ." Uniroyal Goodrich admitted that it manufactured the "technical excellence SP7000 S tire, size P-235/70 SR15 model steel belted radial tire . . ." on the Fords' van at the time of the collision but denied the tire was defective in any way. Before extensive discovery, Uniroyal Goodrich moved "to consolidate or, in the alternative, assign these companion cases to the same judge, pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a)," and the cases were assigned to a single judge. Plaintiffs settled with NTW before trial. Over objection by Uniroyal Goodrich, the cases were tried before two separate juries, simultaneously. One jury decided Mrs. Ford's case (with Mr. Ford's consortium claim) as against both the New York Uniroyal Goodrich partnership and the Delaware Uniroyal Goodrich corporation. The other jury decided Franklin Ford's case against the same defendants.</div><div class="casepar">The parties stipulated that "the subject tire . . . was manufactured by defendant [Uniroyal Goodrich], a New York partnership, at the Tuscaloosa plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in the thirty-fifth week of 1987." The following circumstances and chronology are undisputed: Mr. Ford purchased two new tires from NTW on February 18, 1988. He noticed that the van vibrated after these tires were mounted. When Mrs. Ford returned the van to NTW, she was informed that one "tire was out of round" and received a substitute. At the time of the blowout on Saturday, August 26, 1989, the tire at issue had been driven 13,000 miles. That day, the Fords and their two sons were driving north on I-85, returning to Norcross, Georgia, from a vacation in Florida. South of Hartsfield International Airport, Mr. Ford drew Mrs. Ford's attention to a slight vibration, similar to those vibrations of the van observed while driving on the tire they had replaced. She "could feel it going uphill and . . . could not feel it at other times." Although they discussed the possible source of the intermittent vibrations, the Fords never discussed "getting off the road and terminating the trip[.]" Between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m., as they approached the Clairmont Road exit, Mrs. Ford heard "a thump in the van[ . . . and saw that her husband] was just struggling with the [steering] wheel. . . ." Within seconds, she heard "another thump and [Mr. Ford] said, that was the tire." The van "skittered a while and came to a stop. And cars were just coming all around us." In vain, Mr. Ford tried to move the van from the lane of traffic into the emergency lane. Mrs. Ford "could hear him pressing the accelerator and the van would not move." Other cars were "squealing around [them]. They would come up on [the Fords] quickly and have to swerve . . . to get around. . . ." Some vehicles, including a tractor-trailer, had merged left and passed the stalled van by "going into the emergency lane." The Fords "all agreed that we just did not dare try to get out." They remained trapped in the van for "five or six minutes," strapped into their seats with seatbelts, facing ahead. Franklin Ford turned on the four-way hazard lights while Mr. Ford tried to summon help on the C. B. radio. With the rearview mirror, Mr. Ford observed as Rebecca Parson's station wagon speedily approached from the south, and he exclaimed, "this one's not going to stop." The impact of the ensuing crash pushed the van 200 feet. "It was just like we . . . got hit by a freight train." When the van finally came to rest, Franklin Ford's "seat had twisted and come back so that he was . . . on his back. . . ." He was "trembling and convulsing[, while Mrs. Ford's right] leg was broken."</div><div class="casepar">It is uncontradicted that neither Uniroyal Goodrich nor NTW ever gave the Fords any consumer warning not to drive the vehicle if vibrations were observed because such vibrations could be a symptom of imminent belt separation leading to loss of air and possible vehicle crash. The existence of a manufacturing defect, of the need to warn, and of the foreseeability of the type of catastrophic harm actually sustained were very much in dispute. The following evidence was adduced in support of the contentions that the tire at issue was defectively manufactured and Uniroyal Goodrich failed to warn the Fords of a foreseeable danger: Officer Steve Merrifield, a traffic specialist and accident reconstructionist with the DeKalb County Police, was called to the scene. From his analysis of the physical evidence, the jury was authorized to conclude the "tread had come loose [from the carcass of the tire] and had wrapped around the axle of the vehicle, while the vehicle was moving. The leading edge of the tread had wrapped around the axle; had wedged itself; . . . had locked the left-rear wheel. . . . The tire, with no tread left on the pavement, the cord wore through quickly; blew the tire out. It aired out. The wheel was locked up and . . . the vehicle, basically, became immobilized." Photographs showing where the "rim was grinding on the pavement [indicated that] one of the wheels on the vehicle was . . . locked." This grinding of the pavement started "probably [one] hundred feet . . ." from where the Fords' van came to a halt. Three hundred feet back from that place, Officer Merrifield found "an offset mark that indicated that . . . [the belt] was flapping." So tightly was the belt wrapped around the axle, it took the police "an hour and a half . . ." to remove the wheel without cutting the belt. Stephen P. Disch, M. D., the treating neurologist, thought that Franklin Ford's brain injuries occurred when he "had a side-to-side action and that his head on the right side probably hit something on the right side[, . . . ] then went side-to-side[; . . .] sheared the blood vessels and caused the blood clot." Dr. Disch affirmed that these injuries were compatible with the Fords' van being propelled first to the right by the blow of the collision "and then, because of the locked wheel on the left, chang[ing] direction to the left." Franklin Ford's permanent brain injuries are "the equivalent of having a stroke." He is "hemiparetic on the left side of his body."</div><div class="casepar">William J. Campbell worked at the B. F. Goodrich plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for over 27 years. Since 1981, he had been in the Quality Assurance Department. In that position he had so-called shut-down authority "in cases of either machine alignment or components or tolerances[.]" However, after the 1986 merger of B. F. Goodrich and Uniroyal Tire Company, he noticed a very definite change in his authority. "Oftentimes, [a machine he ordered shut down] wouldn't stay down. The decision would be made to go ahead and run the machine. There was more of an emphasis put on keeping production going." The post-merger company "relaxed [former] tolerances on components [and . . .] relaxed tolerances on machine alignment."</div><div class="casepar">During the summer of 1987, when this tire was manufactured, Mr. Campbell noticed a continuous emphasis on production, with each of the four plants in the Uniroyal Goodrich system being assigned daily, weekly, and monthly quota productions. While production was increasing, the size of the post-merger Quality Assurance Department was permitted to diminish through retirement and attrition. Mr. Campbell observed green (uncured) tires hanging from racks, where they would "sit there for a number of days before they were cured." Such a delay can cause distortion in uniformity and even lead to "some separations." If a "tread edge lifts and paint gets in there, . . . it could cause a crack or a separation [of the steel belts] when it cured." Because the Tuscaloosa plant had no air conditioning, during the hot and humid summer months, Mr. Campbell "would notice the tack[, i.e., stickiness of uncured tires,] in the different stock would change. [As a result, the manufacturer would] have to change the compounds to increase tack. That was an ongoing process. . . ." In the absence of "a proper amount of tack [the pressure of the stitching cycle] could cause the different components, whether it be belts or cone strip or whatever, it could cause them to shift around, move, literally move." It was not uncommon in the tire room for the indoor temperature to reach 105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. When moisture or perspiration got "on the tire itself, especially if it got trapped between plys or between belts or under the tread, that would cause contamination and it probably wouldn't cure out." Workers were offered sweatbands, but some "refused to wear them." John M. Swarts, a retired Manager of General Tire Compounding for Uniroyal Goodrich, confirmed that high temperatures and humidity affect the compounds used in tire building in that "it tends to degrade the tack." Consequently, "it doesn't have as much strength. It won't stick to other things as good as it used to." Mr. Campbell's diminished Quality Assurance staff no longer could physically inspect the same number of finished tires. They "went from [physically] inspecting [one entire stack] of one group of tires [. . . down to just visually] inspecting the top three tires on the pallet." Mr. Campbell related incidents where production employees would tinker with the preset speed at which the tire is rotated while steel belts were joined to the rubber. This applied the belt faster than it was being fed to the worker and "can stretch and distort the belt by doing that." On one occasion, loose tires from the scrap heap were added to round out a load, and that load was then sent to the warehouse.</div><div class="casepar">In late 1987 and early 1988, William H. Hudson, the Supervisor of Failed Tire Analysis for Uniroyal Goodrich, conducted an investigation of reported tire failures involving "belt separations or separations in the tread areas" for Uniroyal Goodrich management. He determined "that the B. F. G[oodrich] side of the family had more separations returning to the adjustment centers than the Uniroyal tires. . . . And the . . . Tuscaloosa plant . . . produced more separations per volume of built tires than the other plants." He examined "every conceivable tire that was sent back to the adjustment centers[,] of all sizes and all brands[, . . . numbering] close to two to three thousand tires[,]" built between 1984 and 1988. These were tires that customers returned and the manufacturer agreed to take back. If there were no problem with excessive incidents of belt separation, Mr. Hudson expected to see that condition in "less than one percent . . ." of the tires returned for adjustment. When compared to the industry average as the normal rate of return for all defects, the percentage of total production returned for belt separations alone was eight times greater than that industry average. He further found that, of all the tires returned under warranty for belt separations, "more than ten percent . . ." were manufactured at Tuscaloosa. Based on Uniroyal Goodrich criteria, this was "high enough that you would want to address the situation and to get it back to a normal area." He affirmed that his report was "given to . . . management at Uniroyal Goodrich," sometime in early 1988, i.e., near the time Mr. Ford purchased his tires and 18 months before this tragic collision.</div><div class="casepar">Mr. Hudson also examined the Fords' tire and concluded that "the tire separated because of lack of adhesion between the belt surfaces that are present in this tire." This is evidenced by the "smooth appearance" of the separated belts. Ordinarily, wavy stock lines, called knotty tear lines or serrations, indicate resistance to separation. On the Fords' tire, the "absence of these types of serrations lines indicate that is less adhesion." He observed no "abrasion in the shoulder area to show that this tire was actually running underinflated or overloaded." Rather, he affirmed that the lack of adhesion as the cause of this tire's failure was a "manufacturing defect[.]"</div><div class="casepar">Richard James Grogan, a pneumatic tire consultant, examined the Fords' tire and found "chafing, that is movement, very small movements, but many, many hundreds of times over inside the tire." Mr. Grogan's X-rays of the Fords' tire show that the stacked steel "belts have been sliding about or snaking as it's known in the business." He also found "shiny bits of brass in the failed tire, that tells us of incomplete adhesion, incomplete bonding," because the brass plating should have been converted to black brass sulfide during the vulcanization process. He found "some bonding, but not enough, not enough to combine all that brass and fuse it to the rubber." Further, Mr. Grogan discounted the likelihood that the Fords abused the tire because, in his opinion, "damage that arises from underinflating . . . , [and] to a certain extent overloading as well, will affect the tire uniformly around." On the Fords' tire, Mr. Grogan found "bits of the tire which are reasonably intact and bits which have come apart. So it can't be underinflation, it can't be overloading. It's wrong in appearance and it's wrong in position." Mr. Grogan also explained that "rubber components have to be fresh and tacky to stay in place where the tire maker puts them. And if the factory is not air-conditioned, then the shelf life, the useful life of those components is very much reduced, and there's a tendency for those sticky components to dry out quite rapidly and air conditioning helps this process enormously."</div><div class="casepar">Steven R. Syson, an accident reconstructionist and former engineer with the "Safety, Research and Development Laboratories at the General Motors Proving Grounds," affirmed that, in his experience, "manufacturers of components [including tires] are [subject to] federal regulations that are . . . the same as . . . for auto makers[.]" The tire manufacturer must comply with "uniform tire quality grading requirements and then tires are also subject to the notification and recall procedures of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration." Mr. Syson explained that the notification and record-keeping procedures of the U. S. Department of Transportation include the "requirement that all defective products be reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration." In Mr. Syson's opinion, the tire manufacturer had a duty to inspect the "out-of-round" tire that the Fords had returned under warranty. "[A]s a result, if they had inspected that tire, they would have found that that particular tire had a problem with tread separation. And I think, under those circumstances, they had a duty, at least, to notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that they were having a problem with this particular size and date of manufacture of the tire and, then, . . . at that point, [had a further duty to] investigate how many other failures they were having and make a determin[ation] as to whether or not they needed to do a recall." Mr. Syson also affirmed that, "in the automotive industry, including . . . tires, if a manufacturer knows or has reason to believe that there is a defect, they have a duty to warn the public[.]" Specifically, if the manufacturer knows that a "certain defect presents itself in a certain way, [it has] a duty to warn the public about what to anticipate when that defect shows up[.]" Mr. Syson recalled that General Motors maintained a policy manual for defect and recall procedures that "tells you what to do and how to deal with situations like that and, . . . if you have a problem, then you have a duty to inform the consumer of it[.]"</div><div class="casepar">Plaintiffs' exhibit 93 is a September 2, 1987, document authorizing changes in the manufacturing specifications and indicates that Uniroyal Goodrich was operating under the assumption that certain radial passenger tires produced at Tuscaloosa could be "defective at plant[,]" due to inadequate tack. According to this technical authorization, the modification "will result in a dramatic increase in tack retention (aged up to 4 days). This is very critical during hot summer weather. . . ." However, two months later, on November 2, 1987, Uniroyal Goodrich approved another technical authorization. This technical change abandoned the recent modification, which had been projected to save more than $400,000 per year, and reverted to previous compound and bonding formulae. Although the defense offered alternative explanations for the Fords' tire failure, even the expert tire engineer called by Uniroyal Goodrich conceded that underinflation alone "didn't cause this tire to fail." Redacted copies of service bulletins giving notice and instructions to dealers of the voluntary recall of other Uniroyal Goodrich tires were admitted for the limited purpose of showing the manufacturer's knowledge that "[b]elt separation may also cause moderate to severe vehicle vibration. Continued operation could cause rapid air loss and vehicle crash."</div><div class="casepar">One jury found for Mrs. Ford but against Mr. Ford in his claim for loss of consortium. This jury further determined that Uniroyal Goodrich should not be liable to Mrs. Ford for punitive damages. The other jury found for Franklin Ford and further determined that Uniroyal Goodrich should be liable for punitive damages. After subsequent deliberations, Mrs. Ford was awarded $150,000 for her actual medical expenses and for her pain and suffering. The other jury awarded Franklin Ford more than $465,000 for past medical expenses; $3,022,000 for future medical expenses; $1,561,000 for reduced earning capacity; and $12 million for his pain and suffering. This jury also imposed punitive damages in the amount of $25 million. The four appeals in Case Nos. A95A0465, A95A0466, A95A0468, and A95A0469 follow the denial of post-trial motions by Uniroyal Goodrich for new trial, for judgment n.o.v., and for reduction in damages. The 26 enumerations of error urged are broadly classified as procedural objections, evidentiary objections, and exceptions to jury instructions. In Case Nos. A95A0467 and A95A0470, Franklin Ford and Mrs. Ford cross-appeal from the order of the trial court denying their motions to dismiss the post-trial motions of Uniroyal Goodrich. Case Nos. A95A0465, A95A0466, A95A0468, and A95A0469</div><div class="casepar">1. In the first enumeration, Uniroyal Goodrich contends the trial court committed procedural error by "conducting simultaneous trials of unconsolidated cases without the consent of the parties. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span> (a) provides: "When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, if the parties consent, the court may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs and delay." In the cases sub judice, there was no consent by Uniroyal Goodrich to a joint trial before separate juries. Accordingly, the trial court did err in ordering the joint trials of unconsolidated actions without the consent of the parties. However, the State Court of Fulton County had jurisdiction over each Uniroyal Goodrich defendant separately by reason of their being properly named and served in the substantively identical suits as filed by Mr. and Mrs. Ford against the Delaware corporation and by Franklin Ford against the New York partnership, respectively. Furthermore, venue remained proper in Fulton County despite the plaintiffs' settlement with NTW, the sole resident defendant. Carney v. JDN Constr. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/23/index.html">206 Ga. App. 785</a></span>, 790 (5), supra. Consequently, the error in trying the separate cases jointly without the consent of the parties "does not require a reversal of the judgment[.]" Herring v. McLemore, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../749/0/index.html">248 Ga. 808</a></span>, 809 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../749/0/index.html">286 SE2d 425</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">2. Three days before trial, in response to plaintiffs' motions to add a party, the trial court amended the pretrial order to add the New York partnership Uniroyal Goodrich as a defendant in Mrs. Ford's case and to add the Delaware corporation Uniroyal Goodrich as a defendant in the "Franklin Ford, III case[.]" Although the trial court considered that it was merely correcting the style of the case, defendants objected, arguing that "new parties have an absolute right to be served, answer the complaint, and opportunity to raise any personal defenses or other defenses they may have to any claims." In the fourth enumeration, Uniroyal Goodrich complains of this procedure.</div><div class="casepar">Appellate courts are reluctant to control an exercise of the discretion reposed in the trial court by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/16/index.html">9-11-16</a></span> in formulating and amending the pretrial order. Ambler v. Archer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../128/14/index.html">230 Ga. 281</a></span>, 285 (1), 287 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../128/14/index.html">196 SE2d 858</a></span>). Assuming without deciding that in the cases sub judice Uniroyal Goodrich did not invite this procedure by its previous motion for consolidation of the cases under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/42/index.html">9-11-42</a></span>, and pretermitting whether each Uniroyal Goodrich defendant waived service of process in the opposite suit by making a general appearance, I note that substance and function prevail over nomenclature. Chan v. W-East Trading Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/06/index.html">199 Ga. App. 76</a></span>, 77 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/06/index.html">403 SE2d 840</a></span>). Strictly speaking, neither Uniroyal Goodrich defendant is a stranger or a "new" party to the substance of these product liability actions, since each had been properly served in one action or the other, and each filed responsive pleadings and engaged in extensive discovery over a period of many months. Compare Stone Mountain Aviation v. Rollins Leasing Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../433/23/index.html">174 Ga. App. 35</a></span>, 36 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../433/23/index.html">329 SE2d 247</a></span>). In the cases sub judice, the substance of the trial court's action in amending the pretrial order was to make all allegations uniform against each existing defendant, rather than to make a complete stranger to the action a new defendant. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/16/index.html">9-11-16</a></span> (a) (2). Here, neither the Delaware corporation nor the New York partnership has shown that it was unfairly surprised, that a valid defense was surrendered, that a valuable cross-claim was lost, or that the amendment created rather than prevented a "manifest injustice" under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/16/index.html">9-11-16</a></span> (b). Moreover, it appears that any risk of harm from additional exposure to liability may be addressed in a separate action for contribution or indemnification. It follows that any error in not requiring service of an amended complaint after the amendment of the pretrial order is not fatal to the judgment in this instance. This enumeration is without merit, and so I respectfully dissent from the majority's holding to the contrary.</div><div class="casepar">3. Uniroyal Goodrich enumerates the denial of its motion for judgment n.o.v. as to the punitive damages awarded for Franklin Ford's permanent partial paralysis and loss of mental capacity, arguing that a "mere 'battle of the experts' is not clear and convincing evidence of malice or wantonness." I do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence that Uniroyal Goodrich management knew, from its own internal investigation conducted by Mr. Hudson, that belt separation due to inadequate tack occurred with a markedly greater frequency among tires manufactured at Tuscaloosa during the hot and humid summer months was, in the opinion of Mr. Syson and others familiar with the applicable regulations, sufficient to trigger defect-reporting requirements imposed on the industry by federal law. Although Uniroyal Goodrich vigorously contested the applicability of the reporting requirements, the evidence on that issue was in conflict. See Windermere v. Bettes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/22/index.html">211 Ga.

Golden Key Realty, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../343/90/index.html">200 Ga.

The subsequent failure of Uniroyal Goodrich to warn of or otherwise remediate a latent hazard which was nevertheless obvious to the manufacturer is some evidence of scienter, i.e., reckless disregard of the known facts. This circumstance provides a clear and convincing evidentiary basis for the award of punitive damages in some amount against the manufacturer of the defective product under the standards established by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b) and (e) (I). In Georgia, the "purpose of punitive damages [generally] is to deter the repetition of reprehensible conduct." Hosp. Auth. of Gwinnett County v.

The purpose of subsection (e) (1) of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> specifically "is to authorize punishment of a defendant who has the potential to greatly damage society at large." Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 541 (2a), 542 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">436 SE2d 635</a></span>).

[Cit.]"). In the cases sub judice, an award of punitive damages was authorized to deter in the future a dilatory response to a manufacturer's own evidence reliably indicating a safety threat to the motoring public. Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 544 (4), supra. See also Windermere v. Bettes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/22/index.html">211 Ga. App. 177 (1)</a></span>, 178, supra, applying the whole court decision in J. B. Hunt Transport v.

As it is my view that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for directed verdict as to punitive damages, I respectfully dissent from the majority's holding to the contrary.</div><div class="casepar">4. Uniroyal Goodrich also contends the trial court erred charging the jury on the substance of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (2). This Code subsection provides that 75 percent of the punitive damages awarded in a product liability action, less a proportionate part of the costs of litigation, will be paid into the treasury of the State of Georgia. While it is argued that informing the jury of this fact will encourage an increase in the amount of the award, I do not agree that any such influence is beyond the scope of the present statutory scheme.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>, as enacted in 1987 and since amended, provides a comprehensive scheme governing the imposition of punitive damages in the courts of this state. In the case of product liability claims, there are two significant changes from previous law. First, repeated awards of punitive damages for the same conduct (no matter how egregious) were eliminated. Now, only one award of punitive damages may be recovered from a product liability defendant for any act or omission regardless of the number of causes of action which may arise from such act or omission. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (1). The second change is the division of any punitive damages award between the plaintiff and the public treasury as noted in the challenged charge. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (2). The issue presented is what is the jury's role in this statutory scheme.</div><div class="casepar">Either the jury is informed of the provisions of the statutory scheme and allowed to consider this information in reaching its verdict on punitive damages or charges detailing the statutory scheme are prohibited. The latter approach results in an attempt to reach a punitive damages award on the same theoretical basis as under prior law despite extensive legislative reform of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> as amended. However, since the statutory provisions are general law and have been widely publicized, a choice not to charge on this Code subsection must endure the fact that many jurors will have independent knowledge of the statutory scheme.</div><div class="casepar">In Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 541 (2a), 543, supra, the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected an equal protection challenge to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (2), holding that under the statute similarly situated parties would be treated equally. In order for equal treatment to be a reality, there must be consistency as to whether or not jurors are aware of the statutory provision. Apart from the presumption of knowledge of the law, this is a well-publicized general law. It must be anticipated that some portion of the jurors chosen to serve on product liability cases will be aware of the statute and bring this knowledge into the jury room. Thus, as a practical matter, the option of having product liability cases decided in every instance by a jury ignorant of this law is probably not available. If the parties in all such cases are to be treated equally, the instruction of the jurors as to such applicable statutes is necessary and proper.</div><div class="casepar">There is no denial that the charge in question is a correct statement of the law. The general rule is that a requested charge which is a correct statement of the law and properly adjusted to the evidence may and should be included in the trial court's instructions to the jury. This rule, like many others, is subject to a number of exceptions, and it is argued here that the charge is erroneous because it encourages the jury to increase its punitive damages award. This objection may have intuitive appeal but erroneously presupposes that such an increase of the one-time punitive award is unfair or prejudicial under the Georgia statutory scheme. If jury charges are to be rejected simply because they may influence the verdict, what instruction could possibly be proper for the jury's consideration?</div><div class="casepar">The underlying assumption of this enumeration of error is that an award of punitive damages in a product liability case under the present scheme should be no greater than that which would have been awarded in a similar case under prior law. In my view, this assumption is without support in the record and is contrary to the express provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e). The present scheme for punitive damage awards in product liability cases presents a tradeoff in that there now may be only one award of punitive damages in product liability for a given act or omission (no matter how egregious) but that one verdict is "unlimited." See Mack Trucks v. Conkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../306/3/index.html">263 Ga. 539</a></span>, 541 (2a), 543, supra. If that one unlimited award of punitive damages is to stand in the place of several awards which might have followed but for this statutory scheme, it seems reasonable to anticipate that this one award could be larger than amounts awarded in similar cases under prior law. The statutory tradeoff is facilitated by the provision diverting 75 percent of the proceeds to the public treasury which reduces any constraint on the jury arising from concern for unduly enriching a plaintiff who has already been awarded compensation for his claim. In order for this tradeoff to be realized, the jury must be instructed as to the statutory scheme. The charge on OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (2) was not error.</div><div class="casepar">5. In the twenty-third and twenty-fourth enumerations, Uniroyal Goodrich nevertheless contends the trial court erred in failing to set aside the $25 million punitive award as outrageous and excessive.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (e) (1) provides: "In a tort case in which the cause of action arises from product liability, there shall be no limitation regarding the amount which may be awarded as punitive damages." In Georgia, the amount of punitive damages to be awarded (if any), like damages for pain and suffering, has long been determined according to the facts of the case as evaluated in the enlightened conscience of a fair and impartial jury.

      In reviewing a motion for directed verdict or judgment n.o.v., the trial judge and the appellate court have the same basic task. Both must determine as a matter of law whether the evidence was sufficient under the same standard: "If there is no conflict in the evidence as to any material issue and the evidence introduced, with all reasonable deductions therefrom, shall demand a particular verdict, such verdict shall be directed." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (a). The appellate court must decide whether the trial court was right or wrong in applying this standard. See Gregory, Georgia Civil Practice, p. 505,  6-17 (1990). Although cases also hold that the "any evidence" rule is the standard of appellate review of the trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict (see Mattox v. MARTA, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/36/index.html">200 Ga. App. 697</a></span>, 698 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/36/index.html">409 SE2d 267</a></span>) (1991)), this should not be taken to imply that the appellate court will defer to the trial judge's determination if there is "any evidence" whatsoever to support it. The issue on appeal remains whether or not there is "any evidence" sufficient under the applicable standard. In the case of punitive damages, the standard of review must also be applied in conjunction with the requirement under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b) that the evidence must be "clear and convincing."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;

However, after the jury charge, appellants specifically objected to the charge regarding breach of warranty and reiterated their position that NTW was not a proper party to the suit. That the objection was not made at the charge conference is immaterial. The requirement is that it must be made before the jury returns its verdict.
