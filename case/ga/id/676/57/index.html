Vaughn sued Mrs. Eva Lee Butler and Mrs. Marjorie Green Townsend to recover for injuries and damages allegedly sustained when a vehicle owned by the defendant Mrs. Butler and being driven by the defendant Mrs. Townsend pulled across a highway immediately into the path of the plaintiff's automobile. The negligence alleged as to each defendant was as follows: "That the defendant Marjorie Green Townsend was guilty of negligence in the following particulars: (a) In failing to stop the vehicle which she was driving at the entrance to a through highway, the same being negligence as a matter of law; (b) In failing to yield the right of way to plaintiff's vehicle which was approaching on said highway, the same being negligence as a matter of law; (c) In failing to maintain a proper lookout so as to observe plaintiff's vehicle approaching on said highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard, the same being negligence as a matter of law; (d) In driving said automobile into and through highway and into the path of the oncoming vehicle of plaintiff without first stopping, the same being negligence as a matter of law; (e) In failing to have said vehicle under proper control so as to avoid the collision with plaintiff's vehicle, the same being negligence as a matter of law.</div><div class="casepar">"That defendant Mrs. Eva Lee Butler was guilty of negligence in the following particulars: (a) In permitting an inexperienced minor to operate her automobile, when she knew, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, that said driver was incompetent to operate said vehicle upon the highways of this State, the same being negligence as a matter of fact; (b) In permitting an inexperienced person to operate her automobile, when she knew, or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known, that said person was inexperienced as a driver and lacked the skill and judgment to operate said vehicle in a safe and prudent manner, the same being negligence as a matter of fact; (c) In permitting Marjorie Green Townsend to operate her automobile with her full knowledge, consent and permission when she knew that said driver was not qualified to operate said vehicle and that by the exercise of ordinary care should have known that the operation thereof by said unqualified and inexperienced driver would likely cause injury or damage to other users of the highway, the same being negligence as a matter of fact."</div><div class="casepar">On the trial, no demurrers having been filed according to the record in the case, and the jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff, Mrs. Butler, having made a motion for a directed verdict which was overruled, made a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto which was granted. The defendants also filed a joint motion for new trial on the usual general grounds to which Mrs. Butler filed an amendment assigning error on two excerpts from the charge. The trial court granted the motion non obstante veredicto but overruled the joint motion for new trial. In case number 38844 the plaintiff assigns error on the judgment granting Mrs. Butler a judgment non obstante veredicto while in case number 38869 the defendants assign error on the judgment overruling the motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">1. The evidence adduced on the trial of the case authorized a finding that Mrs. Butler was the owner of the automobile and the real question presented by the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto is whether the verdict found by the jury as to Mrs. Butler was otherwise authorized.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence, construed most favorably in support of the verdict, authorized a finding that Mrs. Butler turned the automobile over to her nephew, J. C. Green, that he permitted Mrs. Townsend to drive it although she had no driver's license, was only sixteen years old, and was inexperienced in operating automobiles, that while Mrs. Butler did not know that J. C. Green was permitting Mrs. Townsend to drive the automobile before Mrs. Townsend first operated the vehicle she did have such knowledge before the date of the collision between the plaintiff's automobile and the automobile owned by Mrs. Butler and being driven by Mrs. Townsend, and that no action was taken by Mrs. Butler to forbid Mrs. Townsend from continuing to drive such automobile.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant Mrs. Butler cites the cases of Mason v. Powell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../701/50/index.html">92 Ga. App. 496</a></span> (88 S. E. 2d 734); and Young v. Kickliter, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../175/97/index.html">213 Ga. 42</a></span> (96 S. E. 2d 605), and similar cases to support her contention that the judgment of the trial court granting her a judgment non obstante veredicto was correct. Such cases involve the "family purpose" doctrine and are cases where the member of the family who was granted permission to use the vehicle turns such vehicle over to a third party without the knowledge or consent of the owner and where the vehicle was not being used for the purpose of the agency. Such cases do not control the case sub judice.</div><div class="casepar">Permission may be expressed or implied. Hill v. State, <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. App. 410</span> (81 S. E. 248); Drake v. General Accident &amp;c. Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../710/57/index.html">88 Ga. App. 408</a></span> (77 S. E. 2d 71); Maryland Cas. Co. v. U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../704/30/index.html">91 Ga. App. 635</a></span> (86 S. E. 2d 801). Before the date of the collision out of which the present action arose Mrs. Butler had actual knowledge that her nephew, J. C. Green, had permitted Mrs. Townsend to operate the automobile and she had taken no action to prevent such inexperienced operator from driving the vehicle. Accordingly the jury was authorized to find that the automobile was being driven by Mrs. Townsend with the implied consent of the owner. In the brief of Mrs. Butler in this case it is contended: "Unless Mrs. Butler had authorized J. C. Green to allow others to operate the automobile without his being present therein, or had authorized J. C. Green to appoint a subagent for the purpose of such driving, the owner (Mrs. Butler), could not be liable." The testimony of Mrs. Butler to the effect that she had bought the automobile in her name because her nephew, J. C. Green, was a minor and that she considered it was his automobile, would authorize a finding that she bought the automobile and turned it over to him without any limitation on his authority to use, or to permit others to use, such automobile. This was at least implied permission to Green to permit others to drive the car and coupled with express knowledge that Mrs. Townsend, an inexperienced driver who lacked the skill and judgment to operate the automobile, had been permitted to operate the automobile previously and presented a question for the jury as to Mrs. Butler's liability. The judgment granting Mrs. Butler's motion for a judgment non obstante veredicto was error since the verdict of the jury finding against both defendants was supported by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">"The burden is on the injured person to establish a contention made by him that the operator of the vehicle was incompetent to drive, and, where it sought to hold the owner for permitting the operation of his vehicle by an incompetent driver, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the owner knew or ought to have known of the driver's incompetency and that the owner's negligence in entrusting the vehicle to an incompetent driver concurred with the driver's negligence to cause the injury." 61 C. J. S. 200, Motor Vehicles,  511 (2). "It is generally recognized that one who places or entrusts his motor vehicle in the hands of one whom he knows or from the circumstances is charged with knowing, is incompetent or unfit to drive, may be held liable for an injury inflicted by the use made thereof by the driver, provided the plaintiff can establish that the injury complained of was proximately caused by the driver's disqualification, incompetency, inexperience, or recklessness . . . liability for the negligence of the incompetent driver to whom an automobile is entrusted does not arise out of the relationship of the parties, but from the act of entrustment of the motor vehicle with permission to operate the same, to one whose incompetency, inexperience, or recklessness is known or should have been known by the owner." 5-A Am. Jur, 590, Automobiles and Highway Traffic,  580.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant Mrs. Butler cites cases in support of her position, that the excerpts from the charge were error, where a "family purpose automobile" was turned over to an incompetent driver by the member of the family authorized by the owner to drive the automobile without the actual knowledge or implied consent of the owner and it held that no cause of action would lie against the owner, or cases where actual knowledge was alleged and the petitions were held to be good. The defendant neither cites, nor has this court found, any Georgia decision holding that where an automobile was turned over to an incompetent driver and the owner, from the facts involved, should have known of such incompetency that no recovery could be had for injuries to a third person caused by the incompetency of the driver. In the case of Holt v. Eastern Motor Co., <span class="casemissing">65 Ga. App. 502</span>, 508 (15 S. E. 2d 895), it was said: "The defendant [owner] would not be liable for the negligence of Danford [driver] in the absence of an allegation that it knew or had reason to believe that he was an incompetent driver." No error is shown by the amendment to the motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed in case number 38844, and affirmed in case number 38869. Carlisle, P.
