The judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction of a sister State, awarding the custody of a minor child, which is regular on its face and unimpeached for fraud, is entitled to full faith and credit in proceedings for the custody of the child in this State. Such a judgment may be modified only when it appears that there has been such a change in conditions since the original decree as would authorize the modification of a similar judgment rendered by the courts of this State.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence in this case was not sufficient to support the judgment of the court below.</div><div class="casepar">3. The judgment of the court below, which, in a habeas corpus proceeding and after a total divorce had been granted to the parties, awarded a sum to the mother for the support of the children, was error.</div><div class="casepar">Hurley Odis Peeples brought this habeas corpus proceeding against Mrs. Geneva Tuten Newman, formerly Mrs. Geneva Tuten Peeples, seeking to recover the custody of two minor children. It was alleged that the plaintiff was the father of the two children, Marian Frances Peeples and Joanne Peeples; that he was entitled to have custody of them by virtue of certain decrees of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaufort County, South Carolina; and that they were being illegally detained from him by the defendant. A copy of the orders of the South Carolina court was attached to and made a part of the petition.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant answered and admitted that she has had possession of the two children since June 4, 1951, but denied that she had illegally detained them. She further answered setting out that the plaintiff was not a fit and proper person to have the custody of the children; and that there had been substantial changes in conditions affecting the welfare of the children since the decree awarding custody was rendered. By way of cross-bill, the defendant asked for permanent custody of the children and for their support.</div><div class="casepar">At the hearing, properly authenticated copies of two decrees by the Court of Common Pleas of Beau fort County, South Carolina, concerning the custody of the two children here involved, were admitted in evidence without objection. The first decree was rendered on March 22, 1945. This decree in substance gave the custody of the children to each parent for six months of each year until the oldest child reached school age. Thereafter, custody was awarded to the father for the nine months during the school year, and to the mother during the vacation period. There is no provision for alimony for the support of the wife or the children.</div><div class="casepar">On November 24, 1945, the mother (the defendant in this action) brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaufort County, South Carolina, seeking the custody of the children here involved, in which she alleged that there had been a change of conditions since the original decree which authorized the modification of the judgment previously rendered. In the second decree above referred to, it was held that there had not been such a change in conditions as would authorize the modification of the previous decree.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in the court below testified that he delivered the children to the defendant in June, 1951, in accordance with the decree of the South Carolina court, and that the defendant had refused to return them when it came time to enter them in school. He further testified that he was financially able to provide for the children; that he could and did provide a good home for them; and that he had a good reputation in his community. Several affidavits were introduced to the effect that the plaintiff had provided a good home for the children; that he was a man of good character; that his financial condition was good; and that the children were in good physical condition and had received proper medical care when they were with the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">When the hearing was concluded, the judge of the court below took the case under advisement, and later rendered a decree giving the mother custody of the children during the school months, and the father custody during the vacation period, on condition that he pay $25 per month for each child to the mother for the support of the children while they were in her custody. The order also provided that the father should give good and solvent bond in the amount of $2000, conditioned upon the return of the children to the mother as provided in the order. To this judgment, the plaintiff in error excepted and assigns the same as error.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The decision in this case involves the validity add effect of the judgment of the courts of a sister State. There is no question in this case as to the jurisdiction of the South Carolina court to award the custody of the children here involved, both parties and the children having been within the jurisdiction of that court at the time the award was made.</div><div class="casepar">It is a well-settled rule of law in this State that "A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in another State, awarding the custody of a child to a named person, which judgment is regular on its face and unimpeached for fraud, is conclusive of the status at the time of its rendition, and will be accorded full faith and credit when introduced in proceedings in this State for the custody of the child." Jernigan v. Garrett, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 390</span> (117 S. E. 327). See also Milner v. Gatlin, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 109</span> (76 S. E. 860); Spann v. Edwards, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. 715</span> (77 S. E. 1128); McDowell v. Gould, <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 670</span> (144 S. E. 206); Hammond v. Hammond, <span class="casemissing">90 Ga. 527</span> (16 S. E. 265). There is nothing to the contrary in Brandon v. Brandon, <span class="casemissing">154 Ga. 661</span> (115 S. E. 115), because in that case the child whose custody was being determined was not within the jurisdiction of the court when the award was made.</div><div class="casepar">Gatlin, supra. Therefore, it appears from the rules announced in the cases above cited that, before the courts of this State are authorized to modify the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction of a sister State awarding the custody of a child, the judgment being regular on its face and not impeached for fraud, it must appear that there has been such a change of conditions as would authorize the modification of a similar judgment rendered by the courts of this State.</div><div class="casepar">2. The question, then, which is presented in this case is whether or not the facts and circumstances appearing in the instant case are such as will authorize the modification of the decree awarding the custody of the children here involved. There are several circumstances relied upon to sustain the judgment of the court below modifying the decree of the South Carolina court. It appeared from the evidence in this case that, since the above decree was rendered, a total divorce has been granted between the parties, and that both have remarried other persons. This is not in itself such a change of conditions as will authorize the modification of a decree awarding the custody of a minor child. See King v. King, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 838</span> (44 S. E. 2d, 791), and Shies v. Bodenhamer, <span class="casemissing">180 Ga. 122</span> (178 S. E. 294).</div><div class="casepar">There was also evidence to the effect that the father had contributed nothing to the support of the children since June 4, 1951, the time when they came to live with the defendant in error, although he was financially able to do so. Under the circumstances of this case, this is not sufficient to authorize the judgment of the court below. The defendant in error herself testified on the stand in this case that she and the plaintiff in error had an understanding that she would support the children when they were with her, and that he would support them when they were with him, and that this was in accordance with the decree of the court. This discloses positively that there has been no change of condition in this respect.</div><div class="casepar">There have, of course, been some additional changes in conditions since the decree was rendered. However, any slight change in conditions will not authorize the modification of a decree awarding the custody of a child. There must be some substantial change not naturally expected that affects the welfare of the child. See Kirkland v. Canty, <span class="casemissing">122 Ga. 261</span> (50 S. E. 90); Sells v. Sells, <span class="casemissing">172 Ga. 911</span> (159 S. E. 237); Barlow v. Barlow, <span class="casemissing">141 Ga. 535</span> (81 S. E. 433); Watson v. Padgett, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 606</span> (44 S. E. 2d, 232); Fortson v. Fortson, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 116</span> (35 S. E. 2d, 896). None of the changes in circumstances which appear in the record is of such a substantial nature as will authorize the modification of the decree awarding custody of the children in this case.</div><div class="casepar">Great stress is laid upon the evidence to the effect that the children expressed a desire to remain with their mother. It appears from the record that the children were eight and ten years of age when this suit was brought. They themselves did not testify. It is sufficient to say that it does not appear whether or not the desires of the children have changed since the original decree was rendered. The statement of the judge in his decree to the effect that the children told him in a private conversation that they did not want to go back with their father, and that tie thought it best not to disclose their reasons, does not add to the effect of this evidence. The reasons given are not a part of the record in this case and, of course, can not be considered by this court. This evidence is therefore not sufficient to authorize the judgment of the court below.</div><div class="casepar">Rivers, supra. Since it does not appear that there is any substantial reason why the plaintiff in error should be deprived of the custody of the children here involved, and since it has not been shown that there has been any substantial change in conditions since the original decree was rendered, the judgment of the court below was error.</div><div class="casepar">3. The next question presented is the correctness of the judgment of the court below allowing $25 per month for each child, payable to the mother for the support of the children. It will be noted that these parties were granted a total divorce some time ago, and, in so far as the record shows, no alimony was allowed for the support of the wife or the children. Nor was any amount allowed for the support of the children when the decree awarding custody was rendered by the South Carolina court. The wife testified that there was none allowed.</div><div class="casepar">It is a well-settled rule of law in this State that "There is no provision in the laws of this State whereby a divorced wife in her own name, and in behalf of their minor child, may obtain an order or judgment requiring her former husband to pay to her alimony, or an allowance in the nature of alimony, in order that she may support the child, whose custody has been awarded her in the decree of divorce." Rozetta v. Banks, <span class="casemissing">183 Ga. 701</span> (189 S. E. 513). See also Dyal v. Dyal, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 600</span> (1 S. E. 2d, 660); and Hale v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">141 Ga. 361</span> (80 S. E. 992). It follows, the judgment of the court below making an allowance for the support of the children in the instant case in a habeas corpus proceeding, and after a total divorce has been granted the parties, was error.</div><div class="casepar">4. There is a further provision in the order in the instant case providing that the plaintiff in error should give a good and solvent bond, conditioned upon the return of the children to the mother when the period during which he had custody of the children was ended. This provision is apparently not attacked, and will not be considered.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">John F.
