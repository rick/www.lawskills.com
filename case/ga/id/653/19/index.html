Bibb Superior Court. Before Judge Sosebee from Flint Circuit.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, Chief Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The new Election Code provides that the ordinary may recount absentee ballots when a recount is necessary to recanvass the vote where the records show that more absentee votes were cast than were counted.</div><div class="casepar">2, 3, 4. The new Election Code provides the exclusive procedure by which an election may be declared void for malconduct or irregularities, to wit, in a contest filed in the superior court, wherein the malconduct or irregularities must be shown to be such as would have changed the result of the election or placed the result in doubt. The consequence of other malconduct or irregularities lies with those charged with the prosecution of criminal violations of the Code.</div><div class="casepar">William E. Laite, Jr., as a candidate, and five electors filed a petition in the Superior Court of Bibb County to contest the special election for Representative from District 109, Post 3, in the General Assembly of Georgia, held on June 16, 1965, pursuant to Code Ann. Ch. 34-17 (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., p. 26 et seq.). The action was filed against John F. Stewart whose declared election was being contested. There was no other candidate for the office. Briefly, the contest is based on the following alleged illegalities and irregularities: (1) That the absentee ballots were spasmodically delivered by the registrar to the poll officials all during the election day rather than after the closing of the polls at 7 p.m., as required by law; (2) that the absentee ballots were counted throughout the day as they came to the poll officials, rather than having been counted after the polls had closed at 7 p.m., as required by law; (3) that after a recount of the ballots by the superintendent on June 18, 1965, which took place as a part of the recanvass of the absentee ballots, nine unauthorized politicians handled the absentee ballots and passed them around; (4) that the count of the votes in said election was held at a place other than the place designated by the notice posted by the ordinary; (5) that the ordinary conducted a de novo recount of the absentee ballots two days after the election without any authority of law authorizing such a re-count and that the ordinary's certification of John F. Stewart as the winner in said election was void. The defendant filed general and numerous special demurrers to the petition as amended. The court sustained the general demurrer and dismissed the action. The plaintiffs in error except to that judgment.</div><div class="casepar">1. The contest division of the old Election Code (Code  34-3101) reads as follows: "No election shall be defeated for non-compliance with the requirements of the law, if held at the proper time and place by persons qualified to hold it, unless it is shown that, by such non-compliance, the result is different from what it would have been had there been proper compliance." The above Code section was replaced by  34-1703 of the new Election Code. The material provisions of the new Code are as follows: "Grounds for contest.--A result of a primary or election may be contested on one or more of the following grounds: (a) Malconduct, fraud or irregularity by any primary or election official or officials sufficient to change or place in doubt the result; . . ." (d) For any error in counting the votes or declaring the result of the primary or election, if such error would change the result." Under the old law, even though Code  3 4-3101 provided that no election would be defeated unless it could be shown that the result would have been different by reason of non-compliance with the law, the courts, nevertheless, declared void elections in which provisions of the law were not followed, or were disobeyed. The basis on which such decisions were rendered is that if a mandatory provision of the law was violated the election should be held to be void, whereas if the violation of the statute consisted of merely a violation of a directory provision, the election would not be voided unless it could be shown that the result would have been different because of the violation of the law. In the following cases our courts have held that the requirement of law was mandatory and that the violation voided the election: State of Ga. v. Carswell, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 84 (50 SE2d 621)</span>; Lumpkin v. State of Ga., <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 229 (36 SE2d 123)</span>; Moon v. Seymour, <span class="casemissing">182 Ga. 702 (186 SE 744)</span>; Price v. Hodges, <span class="casemissing">172 Ga. 871 (159 SE 241)</span>; Alexander v. Ryan, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 578 (43 SE2d 654)</span>; Cox v. Williams, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/46/index.html">216 Ga. 535 (117 SE2d 899)</a></span>; Crow v. Bryan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/29/index.html">215 Ga. 661 (113 SE2d 104)</a></span>; Briscoe v. Between Consolidated School District, <span class="casemissing">171 Ga. 820 (156 SE 654)</span>; Barrentine v. Griner, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 830 (55 SE2d 536)</span>; Bush v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../655/49/index.html">111 Ga. App. 702 (143 SE2d 21)</a></span>. The following cases have held the legal requirements to be directory only and that a violation of such requirements would not alone void the election: Coleman v. Board of Education, <span class="casemissing">131 Ga. 643 (63 SE 41)</span>; Brumby v. City of Marietta, <span class="casemissing">132 Ga. 408 (64 SE 321)</span>; Hastings v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">181 Ga. 305 (182 SE 375)</span>; Styles v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../166/02/index.html">217 Ga. 228 (121 SE2d 627)</a></span>; Robinson v. State of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../723/59/index.html">82 Ga. App. 584 (61 SE2d 773)</a></span>; Gay v. Clements, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/40/index.html">214 Ga. 136 (103 SE2d 553)</a></span>; Broome v. Martin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../54/index.html">111 Ga. App. 51 (140 SE2d 500)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In so doing the new Election Code provided liberal rules for the contesting of elections and strict penalties for the violations of requirements by election officials to the end that justice be done and that expensive additional elections be avoided unless the violations of the Election Code caused the result of an election to be placed in doubt or caused the result to be different from what it would have been but for the violations.</div><div class="casepar">2. One of the grounds of contest is that the ordinary did not have authority to re-count the absentee ballots. If this contention is correct, the petitioner would be the winner of the election because the original canvass would be the only legal one and according to that canvass, petitioner was the winner. While the jurisdiction and authority to decide an election contest was not intended to be vested both in the ordinary and in the superior court, the ordinary is given authority to re-canvass votes. This does not carry the authority to eliminate votes for any reason. In this case the ordinary recanvassed the absentee ballots in the only way possible, that is, by re-counting them, since three more votes were cast than were originally counted by the officials. We think that such authority is given the ordinary by necessary implication, as well as  34-1504 (d) (i), and  34-1504 (b) of the Election Code. The original canvass showed Laite the winner by two votes. The re-canvass showed Stewart the winner by three votes. The canvass also included machine votes about which no question is raised. So, we hold that under the Election Code the ordinary may re-count paper ballots if necessary to complete a re-canvass of the votes cast but he does not have authority to decide a contested election. That authority is given to the superior court.</div><div class="casepar">3. In view of what is said above, it follows that the obvious intent of the Election Code is to have an election declared void exclusively by the superior court and only when the election is contested and where the evidence shows that the irregularities or malconduct claimed would have changed the result of the election or would have placed the result in doubt. The authority of courts to declare an election void regardless of the consequences of the malconduct or irregularities claimed no longer exists. Since this is true the contestant in this case has foreclosed his right to prevail by failing to request a recount and re-examination of the absentee ballots. The illegal counting of the absentee ballots prevented a legal challenge to any of them at the time they were cast and the contestant could have asked for a re-count and re-examination of the absentee ballots, and, while he could not have shown that the result would have been changed by the counting of votes illegally accepted or voted (because he could not tell how any absentee elector voted), he could have shown that a sufficient number of illegally accepted or voted ballots were cast to place the result of the election in doubt.</div><div class="casepar">4. The other irregularities claimed fall by the wayside under what has been said above. It is not alleged that the votes were counted in such a manner as to make public the manner in which any voter voted, but even if it had been so alleged, the election could not be voided unless the result of the irregularity changed the result of the election or placed it in doubt. The penalty provided is for the official who violates the law--not the requiring of another election. The same is true with reference to the counting of the votes at a place other than the one posted and the handling of the ballots in the celebration after the re-count by the ordinary.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer to the petition for contest and in dismissing the action.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
