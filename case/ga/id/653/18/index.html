Before Judge Parker.</div><div class="casepresiding">HALL, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The petition stated a cause of action for damages arising from an alleged breach of a written contract for the sale of realty, it being a question for the jury whether the allegedly breached provisions of this contract survived the subsequent execution of a deed by the seller and were not merged in the deed.</div><div class="casepar">In this case the plaintiff assigns error on the judgment of the trial court sustaining general and special demurrers to her petition. The plaintiff, a purchaser of real estate, after the seller had conveyed the property to her by warranty deed pursuant to a contract of sale, sued the seller for damages for breach of provisions of the sale contract that the seller "guarantees a dry basement," and "guarantees fireplace to work." The petition alleged all the terms of the contract and alleged that the parties intended that the "special provisions of the sales contract as to the guaranty of a dry basement and as to the guaranty of the fireplace to work, would not merge in the warranty deed but that they would survive its execution, the deed being intended by both parties to be only a partial performance of the antecedent sales contract." The "Special Stipulations" of the contract provided: "7--Seller to accomplish the following work at his expense prior to the closing:" (The specific items of installation of fixtures or equipment in the house and improvements in the grounds are listed.) The special stipulations continue: "8--Seller guarantees a dry basement. 9--Seller guarantees fireplace to work."</div><div class="casepar">"The rule as to merger of previous agreements . . . is subject to exceptions, and the intent of the parties is controlling, the question being one of construction, to be gathered from a consideration of the entire contents of the instruments, or from the instruments and surrounding circumstances. If the deed contains no evidence of intention, the question is open to other evidence to determine such intention, but where merger of a prior contract into a deed is denied, the burden of proof rests on the party so denying to show that merger was not intended." 26 CJS 845, Deeds,  91 (c).</div><div class="casepar">In the present case the allegation that it was always the intention and purpose of the parties that the special provisions of the sale contract, as to the guaranty of a dry basement and as to the guaranty of the fireplace to work, would not merge in the warranty deed but would survive its execution is supported by the form and provisions of the contract itself. The inclusion of the guarantees as to the basement and the fireplace in separate stipulations rather than including them in stipulation 7 would authorize the inference and support the conclusion that the parties intended the seller's obligations in stipulations 8 and 9 to survive the deed rather than to be completed prior to closing as were the items in stipulation 7. The petition alleges that after the execution of the deed, with respect to the wet basement, the defendant installed some drainage the and some concrete. This alleged fact gives some support to the allegation that the parties intended the seller's obligation with respect to the basement to survive the deed. McKee v. Cartledge, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 629</span>, 632, supra.</div><div class="casepar">There is a difference in the facts of the Kollen case and the facts of this case, but this difference does not make a different result necessary or proper in this case. There the guarantee of workmanship, materials and a dry basement was limited to a period of one year. In the present case no specific period for the guarantees is stated; they would be effective, therefore, for a reasonable period. "When a contract fixes no time for performance, it is to be construed as allowing a reasonable time for that purpose; and what is a reasonable time is a matter of fact to be determined by a jury under all of the circumstances of the case." Bearden Mercantile Co. v. Madison Oil Co., <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 695</span>, 702 (<span class="casemissing">58 SE 200</span>); Bryant v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 607</span>, 609 (<span class="casemissing">46 SE 829</span>); Moxley v. Adams, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 164</span>, 165, supra; Morgan v. Colt Co., <span class="casemissing">34 Ga. App. 630 (130 SE 600)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">In Postell v. Hearn, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/68/index.html">104 Ga. App. 765</a></span>, 767 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/68/index.html">123 SE2d 13</a></span>), this court held that contract provisions similar to those in the Kollen case and this case, relied on as a defense to an action on a promissory note, were merged in and extinguished by the deed executed pursuant to the contract. The reasons for that decision were (a) that the pleading did not allege, as the pleadings in the McKee and Kollen cases, supra, did, that the parties intended that certain obligations of the written sale contract were to survive the deed executed pursuant to the contract; and (b) that the provision of the contract that "such papers as may be legally necessary to carry out the terms of this contract shall be executed and delivered by such parties at the time sale is consummated," showed the parties' intention to consummate all agreements in the contract at once. The quoted contract provision in the Postell case appears in the contract in the present case; but the petition in the present case contains the allegation, absent in the Postell case (and also absent in Willingham v. Anderson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../692/59/index.html">96 Ga. App. 799</a></span>, 802 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../707/03/index.html">84 SE2d 471</a></span>)), that the parties intended that the contract provisions survive the deed. Thus, the Kollen case rather than the Postell case is applicable here. When the parties intend survival rather than extinction of contract provisions such as these following execution of the deed, new papers are not legally necessary to effect the survival of such contract provisions. Kollen v. High Point Forest, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/56/index.html">104 Ga. App. 713</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">The allegations of the present petition do not show as a matter of law that the contract provisions sued upon were merged in and extinguished by the deed.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in sustaining the general and special demurrers to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">FRANKUM, Judge, dissenting. The sale contract in this case was executed on November 9, 1961. The deed which was executed on March 1, 1962, contained no reference whatever to the sale contract or to any of its terms. By amendment to her petition, the plaintiff added the following allegations: "It was always the intention and purpose of the plaintiff and defendant that the special provisions of the sales contract as to the guaranty of a dry basement and as to the guaranty of the fireplace to work, would not merge in the warranty deed but that they would survive its execution, the deed being intended by both parties to be only a partial performance of the antecedent sales contract." This allegation unless supported by allegations of specific facts or unless authorized by facts appealing from the exhibits attached to the petition is a mere conclusion and is insufficient to support the plaintiff's action as against a general demurrer. Smith v. Sims, <span class="casemissing">131 Ga. 262 (5) (62 SE 192)</span>; Walters v. Hertz, <span class="casemissing">135 Ga. 817</span>, 820 (<span class="casemissing">70 SE 344</span>); Gwin v. Thunderbird Motor Hotels, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/79/index.html">216 Ga. 652</a></span>, 657 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/79/index.html">119 SE2d 14</a></span>); Finleyson Bros. v.

App. 593</span> (2a) (<span class="casemissing">118 SE 582</span>).</div><div class="casepar">Though it seems to have been overlooked by the majority opinion, the general rule applicable to executory contracts of sale such as is involved in this case is that when they are subsequently carried out by a conveyance which is accepted by the purchaser, they are, in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake, discharged, insofar as they regulate the rights and liabilities of the parties thereto, and where a deed is tendered by the vendor as full performance of the contract and accepted by one vendee without protest, such prior stipulations and agreements as are contained in the preliminary sale contract shall be held to have been waived and abandoned by the parties in the absence of some language contained either in the sale contract in the deed itself affirmatively indicating an intention on the part of both parties thereto to preserve the terms of the sale contract beyond the execution of the deed conveying title. Augusta Land Co. v. Augusta R. &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 519</span>, 522 (1) (<span class="casemissing">79 SE 138</span>); Chamlee v. Alverson, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 637</span>, 639 (<span class="casemissing">89 SE 719</span>); Loftis v. Clay, <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. 845</span>, 848 (<span class="casemissing">139 SE 668</span>); Rigdon v. Barfield, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 77 (3) (20 SE2d 587)</span>; Ingram v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. App. 335 (3) (7 SE2d 922)</span>; Kytle v. Collins, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. App. 98</span>, 108 (1) (<span class="casemissing">19 SE2d 754</span>); Smith v. White, <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. App. 303 (43 SE2d 275)</span>; Willingham v. Anderson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../707/03/index.html">90 Ga. App. 799 (84 SE2d 471)</a></span>. The petition in this case contains no allegations of fact supporting the conclusion respecting the intention of the parties to the sale contract, and I do not think that the language of the contract itself authorizes this conclusion.</div><div class="casepar">The addition by the amendment of the allegations respecting the intention of the parties was, of course, a patent attempt on the part of the plaintiff to conform her petition to the Kollen case followed by the majority opinion. That case is, however, to my mind, clearly distinguishable from this case. The preliminary sale contract attached as an exhibit to the petition in that case provided that the seller guaranteed a dry basement for a period of one year, and it appeared that it was contemplated by the parties at the time the preliminary sale contract. Thus, in that case it was manifest that the parties intended that the warranties contained in the preliminary contract would remain operative beyond the time the sale was to be consummated, and these facts were, therefore, sufficient to substantiate the conclusion alleged in the petition that it was the intention of the parties that the preliminary sale contract would survive the execution and delivery of the deed. The case of McKee v. Cartledge, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 629 (54 SE2d 665)</span>, cited as authority for the ruling in the Kollen case and also relied on by the plaintiff in error in this case because there the contract involved was for the construction of a house upon the described premises "to be completed in full within 30 days or less from date of sale." By the very terms of the contract sued on in that case, performance of at least some of the contract terms could not have been required by the buyer until after the sale was consummated, and, therefore, the buyer would not have had a cause of action for a breach of the contract until after the expiration of 30 days from the date of the sale. Neither of these cases authorizes a judgment overruling the demurrers in the case. I would, therefore, hold that the trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrers and in dismissing the petition.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Felton, C.
