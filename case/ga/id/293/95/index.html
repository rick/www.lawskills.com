The mother's rights were also terminated, but she does not join in this appeal.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant, who is incarcerated, shows, among other things, that he has never been previously convicted of a crime; that he has never received a disciplinary report; that he is considered a minimum security prisoner; that during his incarceration he has worked toward an associate's degree in business and is due to graduate from Massey Business College in December 1994; that appellant has two other children from a previous marriage with whom he has a normal parent-child relationship; and that upon his release appellant has arranged to live with his sister, then lease a house and begin to build back his business.</div><div class="casepar">"Before considering whether to enter an order terminating parental rights, the court must first determine whether there exists 'clear and convincing evidence of parental misconduct or inability. . . .' OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/81/index.html">15-11-81</a></span> (a). To reach this determination, the court must find the child is deprived within the meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/2/index.html">15-11-2</a></span> (8) due to a lack of proper parental care or control by the parent in question, that this state of affairs is likely to continue or is not likely to be remedied, and that such deprivation will or is likely to cause the child serious physical, mental, emotional, or moral harm.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/81/index.html">15-11-81</a></span> (a).

App. 326 (450 SE2d 341) (1994)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The juvenile court concluded that "the evidence is clear and convincing that there has been parental misconduct or inability authorizing a termination of parental rights" as outlined under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/81/index.html">15-11-81</a></span> (b) (4) (A) (i-iv). Appellant essentially argues that the numerous positive factors offered for the court's consideration preclude such a conclusion. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">The juvenile court found: that "the parents have abandoned the child"; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> "that since the child was placed in the custody of [the local Department of Family and Children Services the child's] parents have not provided any financial, moral, physical or emotional support"; that, although incarcerated, appellant had "substantial abilities to make and have contact with the child, [and] has totally and completely failed to do so for a period of approximately two (2) years, or for the entire life of said child," despite making weekly contact with other family members; that appellant disposed of substantial assets while reserving none "for the care, protection or benefit of this child"; that appellant, despite his financial position, allowed the child to be maintained "solely at the expense of the State"; that no effort was made to send cards on birthdays and holidays; that appellant's crimes constitute "acts of moral turpitude [creating] a serious doubt as to the moral fitness of [appellant] to ever adequately parent this child"; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> that appellant's tentative parole date "is currently fixed for August, 1998," and; that the child has no awareness of appellant as a parental figure. (Emphasis in original.)</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's efforts to make the best of his situation and to better himself while in prison are certainly laudable, but that was not the deciding question before the juvenile court. The record shows by clear and convincing evidence that, despite appellant's efforts toward personal betterment and future success, the restrictions upon his freedom to act due to his incarceration are not in themselves sufficient to explain, justify, or in any way excuse his total lack of effort to contact or provide parental support of any kind for S. B. H. during the child's entire life.

In re Estate of Burton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../228/9/index.html">265 Ga. 122 (453 SE2d 16) (1995)</a></span>. As my view of the quality of the evidence (largely disputed) adduced in the case sub judice differs from that of my colleagues in the majority, I respectfully dissent from the judgment affirming the order of the Clayton County Juvenile Court terminating the parental rights of the natural father in his two-year-old child, S. B. H. It is my view that, no rational trier of fact could find by clear and convincing evidence that the father has lost all parental rights to S. B. H. Also, I believe the juvenile court erred in failing to consider whether continued temporary custody of S. B. H. in foster care would be an appropriate remedy for the father's temporary inability to care for the infant.</div><div class="casepar">The termination petition, filed on January 18, 1994, alleges the natural mother of S. B. H. had abandoned the infant and the mother's whereabouts were unknown; that the natural father's last known address was the Scott Correctional Institute in Hardwick, Georgia; that while the "natural mother was married to the legal father at the time of said child's birth . . . , the natural father did not provide support . . . or medical care," either during the pregnancy or during hospitalization; that the father has had no contact with the child since the child was two months old, which was insufficient to establish any familial bond between himself and the child; and that the father has made no attempt to contact or support the child since that time. The mother did not appear at the hearing. The father appeared, represented by court-appointed counsel.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence adduced before the juvenile court showed the following: S. B. H. was born on April 17, 1992. S. B. H. has been in foster care since the age of three months. S. B. H.'s mother has failed to overcome alcohol and drug addictions, and failed to meet the goals of a family reunification plan formulated with the Clayton County Department of Family &amp; Children Services. The father was married to the mother at the time of S. B. H.'s birth but has since sought a divorce. He has been incarcerated since before the birth of S. B. H. For the past 18 months, he has been at the Scott Correctional Institute in Hardwick, Georgia, after pleading guilty to a drug possession charge and to two counts of enticement of a minor (not S. B. H.) for indecent purposes. For these offenses, he received a ten-year sentence, to serve eight years. The natural mother brought S. B. H. to visit him twice in April 1992, but since that time she has abandoned the child. When she attempted to leave the three-month-old S. B. H. in the care of the paternal grandmother, the grandmother protested, claiming that she was too ill at the time to care for the infant. Instead, the grandmother telephoned 911, thus initiating S. B. H.'s being placed in emergency foster care. Temporary custody of S. B. H. was granted to the Clayton County Department of Family &amp; Children Services which placed the infant with a foster mother. By court order dated January 19, 1994, temporary custody was extended for an additional two years.</div><div class="casepar">S. B. H. has been in the foster care of the foster mother since "July of 1992." The foster mother affirmed that there had been "[no] attempt to contact [the foster mother] by [the father] directly[, . . . specifically,] no telephone, no letters, no cards[.]" The foster mother acknowledged that the paternal grandmother sought and exercised visitation with S. B. H. The foster mother would like to adopt S. B. H. if that were possible. The foster mother never attempted to contact the father and did not know whether he had access to her telephone "number, or [her] address[.]" The foster mother testified that as a result of her experience, she was aware that a natural parent could communicate with a child in foster care via the caseworker from the Department of Family &amp; Children Services, without needing to know the foster parent's address or telephone number. The paternal grandmother once gave S. B. H. a doll and offered an Easter blanket, but the foster mother "didn't go to [the paternal grandmother's] over the Easter holidays."</div><div class="casepar">Heather Payne of the Clayton County Department of Family &amp; Children Services has been the caseworker assigned to S. B. H. since December 1992. After the natural mother participated in the formulation of a reunification plan, "she contacted the agency once, requesting to voluntarily surrender her rights for SBH, but she did not follow through with that scheduled appointment." Ms. Payne "[has] not [personally] observed the child [in foster care]. The foster parents live out of county, and [the Clayton County Department of Family and Children Services has] what is called . . . courtesy supervision through that county, and they send . . . correspondence indicating how the placement is." Ms. Payne has never spoken with the father, explaining that "when someone's incarcerated in an area that is that far from [our agency], that we go through . . . correspondence." She has never attempted to formulate a family unification plan for the father, opining in a report to the juvenile court that his "incarceration [is a barrier] to compliance." In that same report, Ms. Payne indicates that, among the paternal relatives who could be contacted, "no one in the family would be willing [or physically able] to care for S. B. H." She acknowledged receiving a letter from the father in December 1993 in which he indicated that "he was aware that the custody was being reviewed for SBH, and that he was in agreement that it be extended for two years." According to Ms. Payne, "when we received the letter, we were beginning . . . to pursue the termination of parental rights. The letter [she] sent in response to [the father's letter] was, . . . notifying him of our intent [to terminate his parental rights]." Ms. Payne was aware that the father has two children from his previous marriage, but had never spoken with either of them and was unaware that a son was then 20 years old.</div><div class="casepar">At the time of the hearing, the natural father was 44 years old. After his 1988 divorce from his first wife, the father lived with the natural mother of S. B. H. for two years before they married. The natural mother is 19 years his junior. While she was pregnant with S. B. H., the father was jailed on the charges of enticement of a minor for immoral purposes and drug possession. The enticement charges involved photographs taken by him of his then girl friend, along with the 13-year-old girl friend of his 16-year-old son, naked in a jacuzzi tub. Neither certified Copies of the guilty pleas nor the photographs themselves were introduced in evidence at the termination proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">The juvenile court determined that S. B. H. was deprived and that the parents had abandoned the child. Specifically, the court found that during the two-year period the father has been incarcerated, he failed completely to make any effort to contact the child despite having weekly contact with his own mother, who is accorded visitation of S. B. H. by the foster parents. Furthermore, the father made no effort to provide material support despite having "disposed of substantial assets with a value estimated to be well in excess of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000.00)... , none of which were made available for the care, protection or benefit of this child[,]" leaving the State to maintain the child in a foster home. Moreover, the juvenile court determined that he failed to send the child any sort of card, or gift on holidays and the child's birthday. In his sole enumeration, the natural father challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to terminate his parental rights.</div><div class="casepar">1. " ' "In order to find an abandonment, there must be sufficient [clear and convincing] evidence of an actual desertion, accompanied by an intention to sever entirely, as far as possible to do so, the parental relation, throw off all obligations growing out of the same, and forego all parental duties and claims."

"[T]he facts in an abandonment case must be construed in the parent's favor and against the abandonment, Meyers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../613/32/index.html">124 Ga.

Svcs., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../482/40/index.html">162 Ga. App. 702 (293 SE2d 6)</a></span>. Due process of law requires that before parental rights may be terminated predicated upon an alleged abandonment of parental responsibilities for failure to provide support for the child, clear and convincing evidence must show that such failure to provide support was wilful or otherwise without justifiable cause. Thorne v. Padgett, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../452/8/index.html">259 Ga. 650</a></span>, 651 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../452/8/index.html">386 SE2d 155</a></span>) (interpreting former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/8/6/index.html">19-8-6</a></span> (b)).</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, the evidence tending to support the determination of the juvenile court that the father has abandoned S. B. H. is the undisputed circumstance that he has not made any effort to contact the two-year-old S. B. H. directly while the child has been in foster care and also the undisputed fact that he has not contributed financially to the child's support. This circumstantial evidence of "an actual desertion, accompanied by an intention to sever. . . the parental relation" must be juxtaposed with the equally undisputed circumstance that defendant has been incarcerated since before the birth of S. B. H. and no longer is gainfully employed. He was never informed of any address for the foster mother. Moreover, there is no evidence the caseworker ever informed him she would forward his communications to the child or to the foster family. The father's stated intent was to rebuild his life with S. B. H. upon his release from prison, where he has been a model inmate. Other unrefuted evidence showed that the father wrote to the clerk of the juvenile court to "contest the petition to terminate [his] parental rights." Both the father and the paternal grandmother testified that she was the vehicle by which he sought to maintain some connection (as opposed to direct contact) with his infant child while he was in prison. The paternal grandmother testified without contradiction that he would always ask her about S. B. H. and wanted her to bring him pictures of the child. On his behalf, the paternal grandmother inquired of the foster mother whether the foster mother would take S. B.

In the case sub judice, given the uncontradicted and unrefuted explanations offered in mitigation of the undisputed fact that the father has not communicated directly with his two-year-old child and has not contributed financially to the child's support while he was incarcerated, I find "no showing of an actual desertion, nor of any intention to sever entirely the parental relation on the part of [the natural father]."

In addition to finding that S. B. H. was deprived due to the failure of the father to support his child financially, the juvenile court found that the criminal charges to which the father pled guilty were "acts of moral turpitude [creating] a serious doubt as to the moral fitness of [the natural father] to ever adequately parent this child."

I am " 'aware of the fact that the [juvenile] court has a great deal of discretion in these cases and its judgment will ordinarily not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of this discretion.

      It appears that appellant did not "abandon" his child in the legal sense, because there is not sufficient evidence that he intended that result. See Thrasher v. Glynn County Dept. of Family &amp;c. Svcs., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../482/40/index.html">162 Ga. App. 702 (293 SE2d 6) (1982)</a></span> ("In order to find an abandonment, there must be sufficient evidence of an actual desertion, accompanied by an intention to sever entirely, so far as possible to do so, the parental relation, throw off all obligations growing out of the same, and forego all parental duties and claims. [Cit.]") This distinction makes little difference from the child's perspective, since appellant has made no effort to meet S. B. H. 's needs (including prenatal care) to the extent it was within his power to do. Given this, and the fact that the juvenile court did not base its authority to terminate on an "abandonment" under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/81/index.html">15-11-81</a></span> (b) (3), there can be little doubt as to what the juvenile court meant by its finding that appellant "abandoned" S.

      Appellant pled guilty to, among other things, two counts of enticing a child for indecent purposes. According to appellant's own testimony at the termination hearing, he took nude pictures of S. B. H. 's mother and his 16-year-old son's 13-year-old girl friend together in a jacuzzi.
