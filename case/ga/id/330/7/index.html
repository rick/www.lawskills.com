Walker Superior Court. Before Judge Wood.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The defendant, James Ray Ward, was convicted of murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, and feticide. He has been sentenced to death for the murder conviction by a jury in Walker County. He appeals his convictions and death sentence. For reasons that follow, we affirm. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. The victim's husband left for work at 6:00 a.m. on August 17, 1989. When he returned from work that evening, the 23-year-old victim, who was five months pregnant, was missing, along with her car. Their 22-month-old daughter was at home by herself.</div><div class="casepar">When the police arrived later that evening, many friends and relatives were present. At first, nothing appeared to be missing except for the victim and her car, but eventually it was learned that a telephone cord had been forcibly removed from the wall jack (leaving the plug), that most of the victim's underwear had been removed from her dresser drawer, and that a quilt and a baby blanket had been taken.</div><div class="casepar">The victim's car was discovered the next day on an unpaved logging road. Her body was discovered the day after that in a trash dump several miles away. Ligature marks around her wrists and ankles indicated she had been bound. Three of her ribs were broken and there were various bruises about her body. Her fetus was in a partially delivered condition. The mother died of asphyxiation resulting from her pharynx being stuffed with wadded-up paper towels. The death of the mother resulted in the destruction of the fetus.</div><div class="casepar">No clear suspects were developed for several months. Then, early in the morning of December 18, 1989, the defendant, wearing gloves and a stocking mask, broke into a Gordon County home and kidnapped a woman from her bed as she lay sleeping with her nine-year-old daughter. He drove the woman to an abandoned farmhouse, forced her to model negligees he had brought with him, and raped her. Then he took her to another abandoned house and raped her again. He told her that he had killed two people and pointed out a "good place" to "dump bodies" if she ever wanted to. He also told her he had been watching her and told her some things about her personal situation that a stranger should not have known. He returned her to her home. Later, she discovered that some of her underwear was missing.</div><div class="casepar">The Gordon County police arrested the defendant at his residence. The defendant's home was unfinished inside. Most of the walls were not sheetrocked and there was no running water and, except for the bedroom, no electricity. The unfinished rooms were full of boxes containing several thousands of dollars worth of lingerie and adult magazines. The defendant maintained notebooks carefully labelling and indexing magazines and lingerie catalogs (including descriptions and numerical ratings of women in the magazines). The officers found scraps of paper with physical descriptions of and tag numbers for women; dates, times and locations of observations; directions to their homes; newspaper clippings about rapes, murders and missing women; newspaper photographs of women; and driver's licenses and insurance cards belonging to various women.</div><div class="casepar">In addition, officers found handwritten directions to the home of the victim in this case, her swimming suit bottom, her quilt and baby blanket, and -- hidden under a pile of wood -- six newspaper articles about her disappearance.</div><div class="casepar">On January 18, 1990, the defendant admitted to police that he had visited the victim's home to check on a well he had helped drill earlier and had spoken to her. He said:</div><div class="casepar">I been a liar all my life. I need some help. If I done it, I didn't mean for it to happen and I am sorry.</div><div class="casepar">2. Ward complains of the state's use of extrinsic transactions to establish motive and identity, and contends they were not sufficiently similar to the crime on trial.</div><div class="casepar">As we stated in Felker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">252 Ga. 351</a></span>, 359 (1) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">314 SE2d 621</a></span>) (1984):</div><div class="casepar">Similarity between the charged crime and the extrinsic crime is an important factor pertinent to a determination of the admissibility of the extrinsic crime. However, it is not the only factor, nor is it necessarily the controlling factor. "The ultimate issue in determining the admissibility of evidence of other crimes is not mere similarity but relevance to the issues in the trial of the case." Williams v. State, 251 Ga. [749,] 784 [(<span class="casemissing">312 SE2d 40</span>) (1983)]. Depending upon the purpose for which the extrinsic offense is offered, "the state may be required to prove a high degree of similarity between relevant characteristics of the extrinsic offenses and the charged crimes, or it may only have the burden of showing a logical connection between crimes which are essentially dissimilar. [Cits.]" Williams v. State, supra, 251 Ga. at 811. (Smith, J., dissenting.) [Footnote omitted.]</div><div class="casepar">The extrinsic transactions in this case show that Ward is obsessed with having control and dominance over women and has engaged in a pattern of ritualistic "stalking" of and collecting "trophies" from women. The extrinsic transactions were relevant to explain the nature of the crime and to prove identity by establishing motive. There was no error in their admission in evidence.</div><div class="casepar">3. An FBI agent who specializes in the study of sex crimes was qualified as an expert witness in the field of sexual deviation and the behavior of violent sexual offenders. He testified at the guilt phase of the trial, explaining sexual deviations and the significance of certain conduct in relation to these deviations. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> In addition, he enumerated for the jury objective similarities between the crime on trial and the Gordon County rape. To this latter testimony, the defendant objects, contending that the presence or absence of similarities were matters which the jurors could determine for themselves. Citing Fordham v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../583/1/index.html">254 Ga. 59 (4) (325 SE2d 755) (1985)</a></span>, he contends this testimony was impermissible opinion evidence. We do not agree. The agent's opinion was one of fact, and was not an inadmissible legal conclusion. The jury was not prevented from drawing its own conclusions from the facts testified to. See McCartney v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../323/5/index.html">262 Ga. 156</a></span>, 159 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../323/5/index.html">414 SE2d 227</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">4. The evidence, although circumstantial, supports the conviction. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">5. There was no error in the exclusion of polygraph evidence from the guilt phase of the trial. Sustakovitch v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../703/9/index.html">249 Ga. 273</a></span>, 275 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../703/9/index.html">290 SE2d 77</a></span>) (1982).</div><div class="casepar">6. Ward raises several issues about the prosecution's guilt-phase closing argument: <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(a) He contends the prosecutor's "make them explain" argument amounted to a comment upon the defendant's failure to testify and was an attempt to shift the burden of proof to the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">The prosecutor told the jury that the defense was not obligated to offer any evidence and that the burden of proof was on the state. The prosecutor's exhortation to "make them explain" why the state's evidence did not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt was not an attempt impermissibly to shift the burden of proof to the defendant. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> United States v. Norton, 867 F2d 1354, 1364, fn. 10 (11th Cir. 1989).</div><div class="casepar">Nor do we view such argument as a manifest attempt to comment on the defendant's failure to testify, nor would the jury have "naturally and necessarily" taken it to be such a comment. Christenson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../355/8/index.html">261 Ga. 80</a></span>, 88 (7) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../355/8/index.html">402 SE2d 41</a></span>) (1991).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Although the defendant was entitled to cross-examine the Gordon County victim about the issues of consent and force, the prosecutor likewise was entitled during his closing argument to comment on that cross-examination in light of the defendant's guilty plea to rape in Gordon County. The prosecutor did not improperly limit and belittle the defendant's right to confront witnesses against him, as the defendant contends.</div><div class="casepar">(c) In response to defense arguments about the lack of mud inside the victim's car despite evidence that it had rained the morning she disappeared, the prosecutor wondered, rhetorically, why the defense was making an issue out of it, because the car obviously did not drive itself to the place where it was found. The prosecutor then commented that, unlike defense counsel, he (the prosecutor) had "grown up in these woods" and that some of the jurors probably had also. The defendant complains about this comment. While the prosecutor's reference to his own experience with "these woods" was doubtless objectionable, Conner v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/4/index.html">251 Ga. 113</a></span>, 122-123 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../651/4/index.html">303 SE2d 266</a></span>) (1983), we do not find the comment sufficiently material or prejudicial to warrant reversing the defendant's conviction.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The prosecutor argued:</div><div class="casepar">Remember during the rape [in Gordon County], he would ask her are you having an orgasm, do you enjoy the sex with me. There are reasons we asked those questions, we can't discuss it in this part of the case, but there are significant reasons for asking those questions.</div><div class="casepar">Although this argument warrants our disapproval, it is too ambiguous to warrant reversal. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> See Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 647 (94 SC 1868, 40 LE2d 431) (1974).</div><div class="casepar">(e) Although statements of personal opinion generally are improper, we find no reversible error where the prosecutor said "I am telling you the truth" while admitting he did not know where the missing telephone cord was, or what had happened to some of the missing underwear.</div><div class="casepar">(f) The prosecutor did not argue impermissibly by telling the jury that convicting the defendant only of involuntary manslaughter "is like convicting Jack the Ripper or Charles Manson for disturbing the peace." Todd v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../383/7/index.html">261 Ga. 766</a></span>, 768 (2) (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../383/7/index.html">410 SE2d 725</a></span>) (1991). See also Tucker v. Kemp, 762 F2d 1496, 1507 (11th Cir. 1985).</div><div class="casepar">(g) It was not impermissible to tell the jury that the victim's daughter no longer had a mother, her husband no longer had a wife, and her mother had lost her daughter. Moon v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../491/3/index.html">258 Ga. 748</a></span>, 760 (35) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../491/3/index.html">375 SE2d 442</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">(h) Finally, that the crime was sexually motivated was a reasonable deduction from the evidence. Wade v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../474/1/index.html">258 Ga. 324</a></span>, 326-327 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../474/1/index.html">368 SE2d 482</a></span>) (1988); Patillo v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../471/7/index.html">258 Ga. 255</a></span>, 257 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../471/7/index.html">368 SE2d 493</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">7. Searches of the defendant's home were authorized either by warrant or by the consent of the defendant's wife. See Caldwell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../400/3/index.html">260 Ga. 278</a></span>, 290-291 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../400/3/index.html">393 SE2d 436</a></span>) (1990). The items seized from the home were obviously relevant to the crime and were properly seized as evidence. The warrants were issued by a neutral and detached magistrate, Sanders v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../524/53/index.html">151 Ga. App. 590</a></span>, 591-592 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../524/53/index.html">260 SE2d 504</a></span>) (1979), and were supported by probable cause. State v. Alonso, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../492/22/index.html">159 Ga. App. 242 (283 SE2d 57) (1981)</a></span>. There was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress.</div><div class="casepar">8. Ward contends that the trial court erred in permitting the state to use as a handwriting exemplar a written statement he made to authorities in the Gordon County case. In the Gordon County prosecution, the statement was suppressed based on a violation of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (101 SC 1880, 68 LE2d 378) (1981). Ward contends that, since the statement was suppressed, its use violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</div><div class="casepar">While under State v. Armstead, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../518/97/index.html">152 Ga. App. 56 (1) (262 SE2d 233) (1979)</a></span>, a defendant cannot be compelled to produce a handwriting exemplar, it is not error to allow the state to use as a handwriting exemplar a written statement voluntarily delivered by the defendant, even if the contents of the statement are later suppressed because of a violation of the prophylactic rule of Edwards v. Arizona, supra, 451 U. S. Cf. Martin v. Wainwright, 770 F2d 918, 928 (11th Cir. 1985) (confessions inadmissible because of violation of "per se" bar are not necessarily involuntary -- fruits of voluntary statements are not "tainted").</div><div class="casepar">9. After the defendant has requested counsel, the police may not initiate questioning. Edwards v. Arizona, supra. "However, the defendant himself may initiate further communications with the police." Housel v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/1/index.html">257 Ga. 115</a></span>, 121 (1) (d) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/1/index.html">355 SE2d 651</a></span>) (1987). The record supports the trial court's findings that Ward initiated communications with the police and waived his Miranda rights. His statement (see Division 1 of this opinion) was properly admitted.</div><div class="casepar">10. By its verdict of malice murder, the jury found that Ward intended to kill his victim. The evidence supports this finding. Hence, there is no merit to Ward's contention that he should not have been sentenced to death because he did not intend to kill. See Jefferson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../558/7/index.html">256 Ga. 821</a></span>, 829 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../558/7/index.html">353 SE2d 468</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">11. Since Ward was not found guilty but mentally ill, we do not address his contention that guilty but mentally ill defendants are ineligible for a death sentence. See Spraggins v. State, <span class="casemissing">258 Ga. 32</span>, 34 (3), fn. 2 (<span class="casemissing">364 SE2d 861</span>) (1988). Compare Fleming v. Zant, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../454/0/index.html">259 Ga. 687 (386 SE2d 339) (1989)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">12. There was no manifest error in the denial of Ward's motion for change of venue. Tharpe v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../322/3/index.html">262 Ga. 110 (5) (416 SE2d 78) (1992)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">13. A criminal defendant is not entitled to a post-indictment committal hearing. Spears v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../547/9/index.html">256 Ga. 518 (350 SE2d 468) (1986)</a></span>.

On June 10, 1991, the defendant filed a motion to recuse the trial judge on the ground that his professional and personal relationship with another trial judge in the circuit, who was the victim's uncle, "reasonably calls into question the impartiality" of the trial judge. In the motion it was conceded that the defense was aware of the familial relationship between the victim and the other judge in the circuit and had not filed a motion to recuse for almost a year, but claimed that "having had the opportunity to personally watch [the trial judge], the defendant" distrusted "the situation."</div><div class="casepar">An outside judge was assigned to hear the motion. After a hearing based upon the motion as filed and a stipulation of facts, the judge assigned to hear the motion ruled against it on three grounds: First, the motion was not timely filed; second, the motion's "bare conclusions" of lack of impartiality were not legally sufficient to support the motion or to warrant further proceedings; and, third, other than the bare fact that another trial judge in the circuit was the uncle of the victim (whom the trial judge did not know), nothing had been presented that might call into question the impartiality of the trial judge.
