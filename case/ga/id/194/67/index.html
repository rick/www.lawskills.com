Before Judge Shaw. Fulton Superior Court. April 14, 1950.</div><div class="casepresiding">WYATT, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">It was error to overrule the general demurrer to the petition in the instant case. </div><div class="casepar">William H. Randall, Mrs. Rela Brown Randall Anderson, Mrs. Elizabeth Brooking Randall Layfield, and Mrs. Gladys Chewning Randall Tye filed their suit in the Superior Court of Fulton County against "the Fulton National Bank as executor and trustee under the last will and testament of William Lane Randall." By amendment, Mrs. Bessie Brown Randall, the wife of W. L. Randall, was made a party defendant, but no relief was prayed as against her.</div><div class="casepar">In so far as is here necessary to be stated, it was alleged: that on April 23, 1935, W. L. Randall died, and the defendant duly qualified as executor and trustee under his will; that on November 23, 1936, Paul Randall, the brother of W. L. Randall, died, and Fulton National Bank of Atlanta was appointed sole executor of his will; that the defendant bank is still acting in all these capacities; that the wife of W. L. Randall is still in life; that in 1932, and before that time, W. L. Randall was insolvent, and this fact was known by all the parties concerned; that W. L. Randall was indebted to Paul Randall, one item of indebtedness being a note dated October 8, 1932, in the sum of $52,677.87, together with interest at six percent per annum; that the note provided on its face, "collateral note, 500 shares Randall Brothers, Inc., capital stock, certificate No. 35"; that this stock, twelve months after the appointment of the defendants as executor and trustee, was worth $150 per share, and was sufficient to pay the indebtedness of W. L. Randall to Paul Randall; but that the defendant bank, which had complete charge of the affairs of both W. L. Randall and Paul Randall, negligently failed and refused to apply said stock to the payment of the said debt, or in any other, way to pay the indebtedness, for which they had sufficient funds available, until during the year 1948, when the stock was applied to the payment of the indebtedness against the wishes of Mrs. Bessie Brown Randall.</div><div class="casepar">It is sought here, among other things, to require the defendant bank to pay into the funds of the estate of W. L. Randall the amount of interest accruing from one year after the defendant bank qualified as executor and trustee to the time the indebtedness of W. L. Randall to Paul Randall was paid in 1948, the contention being that the bank could and should have paid the indebtedness at the end of the first year after its appointment as executor and trustee of the two estates, and thus have stopped the accumulation of interest.</div><div class="casepar">Certain allegations are made about W. L. Randall having transferred the stock above referred to, at a time when he was insolvent, to his wife with intent to defraud his creditors, and, for this reason, the stock was impressed with a trust and was, in fact, at all times the property of W. L. Randall, his wife having transferred the stock to Paul Randall in order to secure the indebtedness of W. L. Randall, her husband. In the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to deal with this feature.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant bank filed general and special demurrers to the petition. The trial court, overruled the general demurrer but did not pass upon the special demurrers. The exception here is to the judgment overruling the general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar"> The provisions of the will of W. L. Randall upon which the plaintiffs in the court below base their right to the relief sought read as follows: "Item Three: All of the rest, residue and remainder of my property of every kind and description, I give, devise and bequeath to my wife, Bessie Brown Randall, my brother, Paul Hill Randall and The Fulton National Bank of Atlanta, as Trustees, in trust, for the following uses and purposes. The said Trustees are directed to receive, hold, manage, invest and reinvest said property and to pay to my wife, Bessie Brown Randall, during her life, from the net income or from the corpus if the net income is not sufficient, the sum of Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars a month, said payments to begin from the date of my death, and to be used for the support of my wife and for the support and education of such of my children as live in the home with her. In addition to said monthly sum, my said wife shall be given the free use during her life of my home on Pace's Ferry Road in Fulton County, Georgia, all taxes, insurance, repairs, assessments and other like charges against said home to be paid by the said Trustees out of other property of my estate. Any net income from my property not required for the above payments shall be added to the corpus and shall be reinvested by said Trustees.</div><div class="casepar">"At the death of my wife, I direct the surviving Trustees to divide the property remaining in their hands into as many shares as there are children of mine then living or having living descendants, this provision to include my children, Rela Brown Randall, Elizabeth Brooking Randall, William Harbut Randall, and Gladys Chewning Randall, and any other child or children that may hereafter be born to me, provided they are living at the death of my wife or have descendants then living."</div><div class="casepar">It becomes readily apparent from this provision of the will that some or all of the plaintiffs in the court below may never have any interest in this estate, the contingency being that at the death of the life tenant, who is now in life, they must themselves be in life, or if dead, have living descendants. Whether the estate here involved should be construed to be a contingent remainder or a vested remainder subject to divestiture, makes no difference, and for that reason it is unnecessary to decide the question.</div><div class="casepar">"Remaindermen, whose estate is vested subject to divestiture upon their death before the life-tenant, can not, during the existence of the precedent life-estate, maintain a suit to cancel a deed executed by the life-tenant individually and also as their trustee, purporting to convey the estate in solido." LaPierre v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 851</span> (89 S. E. 1074). "Of the several complainants, Mrs. Gurr was a life-tenant; the others were remaindermen. So long as the former lives, the latter have no right to bring this suit for an accounting with the party in possession, nor for any of the other relief sought. They must stand by during the life of the life-tenant." Gurr v. Gurr, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 493</span>, 503 (32 S. E. 2d, 507). See also, Stiles v. Cummings, <span class="casemissing">122 Ga. 635</span> (50 S. E. 484).</div><div class="casepar">The authorities in other jurisdictions are in conflict on the question here under consideration, as will appear from 144 A.L.R. 790, et seq. We find, however, the rule to be well established in this State to the effect that ordinarily a contingent remainderman or a remainderman whose estate is vested subject to be divested can not, during the existence of the preceding life estate, and while the contingency exists, proceed against the life tenant or the trustee for the life tenant for accounting or any other relief of that character. Many cases, not necessary here to be listed, follow the ruling as laid down by the cases above cited.</div><div class="casepar">The exceptions to the general rule are: when it is made to appear that the executor or trustee is seeking a discharge, remaindermen of the character now under consideration may enjoin the discharge proceedings ( Raines v. Shipley, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 448</span>, 29 S. E. 2d, 588); when waste of the corpus is alleged, or when property is about to be removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court. A full discussion of the exceptions to the general rule will be found in Kollock v. Webb, <span class="casemissing">113 Ga. 762</span> (39 S. E. 339).</div><div class="casepar">In the instant case, there is no contention that the corpus of the estate is being dissipated, or that the remaindermen, whoever they may be, will not be fully protected when the proper time for an accounting arrives, to wit: the termination of the life estate, and the final determination as to who will finally be entitled to an accounting. The effect of what is sought here to be required is an accounting as to one item only, without any effort to show that the remaindermen in life at the termination of the life estate will in any way suffer damage or loss unless the one item of accounting is now bad. These remaindermen, under the allegations of the petition, "must stand by during the life of the life tenant," and until the proper time arrives for a full accounting.</div><div class="casepar">It follows, from what has been said above, it was error to overrule the general demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Moreton Rolleston Jr., contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">Smith, Kilpatrick, Cody, Rogers &amp; McClatchey, and E.
