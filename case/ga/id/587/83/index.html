Where the issuer sells travelers checks, money orders, or similar instruments as a substitute for cash money on the representation that they represent emergency money and will not expire, a jury may find that placing a latent device in such instrument which will cause its negotiability to cease, unknown to and without fault on the part of the purchaser, constitutes negligence.</div><div class="casepar">2. Refusal by such an issuer to honor the Instrument in a commercial situation, which results in impaired credit, humiliation and mental or physical suffering to the purchaser is a tort compensable in temperate damages, which may vary according to the circumstances.</div><div class="casepar">The unhappy passenger produced his two remaining travelers checks, only to find that on them also appeared the word "Void" beneath his signature. Four telephone calls by two airline employees and the plaintiff respectively to an emergency number printed on American Express literature elicited the information that American Express travelers checks have, as plaintiff's attorney whimsically described it, a concealed self-destruct mechanism which causes the word "Void" to appear when the checks are exposed to liquid. The plaintiff offered proof of identity by ID and other cards, and by signing his name. He was nevertheless informed that due to the information received from the calls to the number furnished by American Express, the checks were valueless to the airline and he would have to refund the $10 received and pay for his ticket in some other currency. Since all of this occurred on a Saturday afternoon when banks were closed, and since the plaintiff, after the refund of the $10 and the voiding of remaining travelers checks had only $3 left and was unable temporarily to contact his family in Savannah, he was forced to spend the night in a hospital lobby and walk on crutches the last three or four miles to the airport, after giving the last of his funds to a taxi cab driver. He received no offer of food, shelter, transportation or medical assistance. The following day he was able to contact friends in Savannah who arranged for his continued transportation.</div><div class="casepar">1. "The proximate cause is the efficient cause, the one that necessarily sets the other causes in operation." Savannah Electric Co. v. Wheeler, <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 550</span>, 562 (<span class="casemissing">58 SE 38</span>, 10 LRA (NS) 1176). Obviously the chain of events complained of was set in motion when the plaintiff purchased the travelers checks, the folder of which contained representations that they were "good until used," and the owner should "keep them as everyday or emergency money -- they never expire." Neither the plaintiff nor anyone else was informed that the checks could expire by drowning. The mechanism (causing certain ink to vanish when wet and leave the word "Void" in two places on the instrument) was for the benefit of the issuer, who is the ultimate entity responsible where the checks are forged or otherwise tampered with. While the purpose is commendable, it must be effectuated in such a manner that the purchaser is not harmed thereby. Failure to warn of a concealed device implanted by the seller which may, without fault on the part of the purchaser, render funds advertised as "emergency money" unusable in a foreseeable emergency, and which results in injury to the latter, may constitute negligence under these circumstances, and it was the prerogative of the jury to so find. The situation is much like that of one who purchases an automobile having a latent defect which causes the brakes to fail and thereby injures him. The plaintiff is not limited to an action for breach of contract, but may sue in tort based on negligence in creating the defect, or in failing to warn him thereof.</div><div class="casepar">Varnedoe sued American Express Company and Southern Airways Company jointly for damages for wrongful ejection from the latter's airplane on which he was a passenger. A verdict against both defendants was returned by the jury and by consent a provision assessing $2,000 damages against the airline and $3,000 against the appellant was not contested on the ground of separability. The testimony, in its light most favorable to support of the verdict, is as follows: Varnedoe had bought a group of $20 travelers checks from American Express in Texas which he used on a vacation. Later, while in Nashville, Tenn., he was thrown from a motorcycle into a water-filled ditch and sustained a painful ankle injury. After first aid at the local hospital he purchased a ticket from Nashville, Tenn. to Savannah, Georgia, paying the Southern ticket agent with three of the travelers checks, which left him with two other checks. He obtained the ticket and $10 in change, was taken in a wheelchair to the airplane and boarded it in considerable pain which, according to the testimony of a flight stewardess, continued through the trip. Meanwhile, the ticket agent again examined the travelers checks and noticed that each contained the word "Void" under the top line identification signature of the plaintiff, and again under the printed check numbers. He alerted employees in Huntsville, Alabama, where there was a scheduled stop. A security officer and an armed uniformed guard there boarded, forced the plaintiff to deplane on crutches, and escorted him into an office for investigation. The rule is, as stated in Mauldin v. Sheffer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/52/index.html">113 Ga. App. 874</a></span>, 878 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../650/52/index.html">150 SE2d 150</a></span>) that to maintain an action ex delicto because of a breach of duty growing out of the contractual relation, the breach must be shown to have been a breach of a duty imposed by law, and not merely a breach imposed by the contract. There is here, over and above the duty of the issuer to honor the travelers check on presentation, a duty not to injure the holder by withholding credit which he has paid for and is entitled to receive, subjecting him to embarrassment, humiliation, loss of time, and physical pain. There is ample evidence to support a verdict regardless of whether we consider the evidence of two of Southern Airways employees who testified they were informed, in reply to the long distance calls to two numbers provided by American Express for such purposes, that the checks were non-negotiable and could be returned only by the plaintiff and (as he testified he was told) only at the place of issuance. This evidence was admitted by the court for the limited purpose of explaining the conduct of Southern Airways (Code  38-302). Such evidence is "not independent evidence to establish the truth of such information." Coleman v. State, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 282 (1) (56 SE 417)</span>. Is it sufficient, however, if the jury believed the co-defendant was so informed, sufficient to allow them to believe that they were so informed by the appellant, where the testimony was that the witnesses did not know the name of the person with whom they talked? Assuming that it was not, it nevertheless established that numbers furnished by the appellant were called on four occasions, and one airline employee testified without objection that immediately thereafter he returned the checks to the plaintiff and told him they were worthless to the airline. From all of this evidence, even when given its narrow construction, the legal inference is that the witness based his decision on the call, the call having been made to a number furnished by the appellant and received on a toll-free long distance line is a circumstance suggesting it was received by an authorized party. The fact that not one but four long distance toll-free telephone calls were made with the same result increases the viability of this inference. These facts also tend to support the negligence aspect of the case.</div><div class="casepar">2. It is further contended that there is no evidence to support a verdict in the amount returned. Appellant argues that there was no injury to "purse or person" so that, in the absence of wilful and malicious conduct, no more than nominal damages could be recovered. See Shook v. Southern R. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/34/index.html">101 Ga. App. 128</a></span>, 131 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../679/34/index.html">113 SE2d 155</a></span>); Massey v. Perkerson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../601/40/index.html">129 Ga. App. 895 (201 SE2d 830)</a></span>. It is quite possible that this verdict ($3,000) can be justified under several theories. One, however, which we deem adequate, is that the sole purpose of the sale of travelers checks is, as the appellant represents it to be, to provide safe and easily negotiable emergency funds to the purchaser. When this purpose fails due to the negligence of the issuer the situation is much the same as when a bank customer's check is negligently dishonored. As to such a situation, in a case where no actual damages were proved, the court held in Atlanta Nat. Bank v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">96 Ga. 334</span>, 336 (<span class="casemissing">23 SE 190</span>): "It has been said that if in such action the customer does not show that he has suffered a tangible or measurable loss or injury from the refusal, he shall recover only nominal damages. But the better authority seems to be, that even if such actual loss or injury is not shown, yet more than nominal damages shall be given," and he is entitled to temperate or substantial damages, as the case may be. "This rule of liability is an exception to the general rule that, save where a tort is committed maliciously, wilfully, or wantonly, proof of actual damages is necessary to sustain an action ex delicto, brought by a person whose rights under a contract have been wrongfully disregarded by another party thereto." Hilton v. Jesup Banking Co., <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 30</span>, 31 (<span class="casemissing">57 SE 78</span>). See also Stevens v. Little-Cleckler Const. Co., <span class="casemissing">19 Ga. App. 483 (89 SE 597)</span>; Milledgeville Bkg. Co. v. Carr, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../673/26/index.html">104 Ga. App. 610 (3) (122 SE2d 284)</a></span>. We do not, therefore, pass upon the other theories advanced by the plaintiff as justifying the verdict in the amount rendered.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for appellant rely on the recent case of Brown v. Hilton Hotels Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../25/index.html">133 Ga. App. 286</a></span> (---- SE2d ----) where it was held that in an action based on the defendant hotel's failure to honor prep aid reservations the recovery would have to be for breach of contract rather than damages for tort, because the damage arose out of the defendant's failure to perform rather than out of the breach of a duty in the manner in which the contract was executed. Here, there is not only a failure to perform, but a breach of a duty owing to the purchaser not to set up a latent condition which might, without fault on his part, destroy the value of his property.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court properly overruled the motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
