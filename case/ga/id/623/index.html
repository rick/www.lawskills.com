Gwinnett Superior Court. Before Judge Stark, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Kelly Renee Gissendaner was convicted of the malice murder of her husband, Douglas Morgan Gissendaner. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> The jury fixed Gissendaner's sentence at death, finding as statutory aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed during the commission of kidnapping with bodily injury, a capital felony, and that Gissendaner caused or directed another to commit the murder. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (2) and (6). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm both the conviction and the death sentence.</div><div class="casepar">1. Gissendaner and the victim had been married, divorced, remarried, separated, and reunited between 1989 and 1997. Ms. Gissendaner was in a relationship with Gregory Bruce Owen and at one point stated to a co-worker that she was unhappy with her husband and in love with Owen.</div><div class="casepar">Prior to Gissendaner's trial, Owen entered an agreement not to seek parole within 25 years, pled guilty, and received a sentence of life in prison. Owen testified at Gissendaner's trial that it was she who first raised the idea of murder and that she later raised the idea again several other times. Owen suggested divorce as an alternative, but Gissendaner insisted upon murder because she believed she would receive insurance money from her husband's death and because she believed he "wouldn't leave [her] alone by just divorcing him." Gissendaner had previously stated to Owen's sister that she intended to use the victim's credit to get a house and then "get rid of him."</div><div class="casepar">During the days leading up to the murder, Gissendaner made 47 telephone calls to Owens and paged him 18 times. Telephone records also showed that the pair were together at a bank of payphones several hours before the murder.</div><div class="casepar">On the evening of February 7, 1997, Gissendaner drove Owen to her family's home, gave him a nightstick and a large knife, and left him inside the home to wait for the victim. Gissendaner then drove to a friend's house, and, upon Gissendaner's insistence that the group keep their plans for the evening, she and her friends went out to a nightclub.</div><div class="casepar">The victim arrived home shortly after 10:00 p.m. Owen confronted the victim from behind, held a knife to his throat, forced him to drive to a remote location, forced him to walk into the woods and kneel, and then killed him by striking him with the nightstick and then stabbing him repeatedly in the back and neck with the knife. As instructed by Gissendaner, Owen took the victim's watch and wedding ring before killing him to make the murder appear like a robbery.</div><div class="casepar">Gissendaner returned home from the nightclub at about the time the murder was being carried out, paged Owen with a numeric signal, and then drove to the crime scene. After inquiring if her husband was dead, she took a flashlight and went toward the body to inspect it. Owen burned the victim's automobile with kerosene provided by Gissendaner, and the pair returned to their respective homes in Gissendaner's automobile. Owen disposed of the nightstick, the knife, a pair of his own jeans, and the victim's stolen jewelry by placing them in the garbage. A pair of Owen's sweat pants also worn on the night of the murder was recovered, however, and DNA analysis of blood found on them showed a likely match with the victim's and Owen's blood.</div><div class="casepar">After the murder, Gissendaner concealed her relationship with Owen from police and claimed not to have initiated contact with him for some time. Telephone records, Owen's testimony, and other witness testimony proved otherwise. After her arrest, Gissendaner called her best friend and confessed to her active and willing role in the murder, although she then called a second time and claimed that she was coerced into participating. Gissendaner wrote a letter while in jail in an effort to hire someone to give perjured testimony and to rob and beat witnesses.</div><div class="casepar">Pretrial Proceedings</div><div class="casepar">2. Gissendaner contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a change of venue. The trial court reserved its ruling until after voir dire had been completed and then denied the motion. We find that the trial court acted properly within its discretion in denying the motion. Tolver v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../132/2/index.html">269 Ga. 530</a></span>, 532-533 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../132/2/index.html">500 SE2d 563</a></span>) (1998) (recognizing trial court's discretion in considering a motion for a change of venue).</div><div class="casepar">A capital defendant seeking a change of venue must show that the trial setting was inherently prejudicial as a result of pretrial publicity or show actual bias on the part of the individual jurors. Jenkins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../125/3/index.html">269 Ga. 282</a></span>, 286 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../125/3/index.html">498 SE2d 502</a></span>) (1998); Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../189/8/index.html">267 Ga. 592</a></span>, 594 (1) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../189/8/index.html">481 SE2d 821</a></span>) (1997); Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../379/4/index.html">261 Ga. 665</a></span>, 666 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../379/4/index.html">409 SE2d 642</a></span>) (1991) (holding a change of venue is required when a "defendant can make a substantive showing of the likelihood of prejudice by reason of extensive publicity").</div><div class="casepar">The trial court excused the following 13 jurors upon Gissendaner's motion based primarily upon their exposure to pretrial publicity: Waldrip; Myers; Krug; Jones; Chapman; Chappell; Henderson; Bullock; Teehan; Moreno; Hill; Hoffman; and Jackson. The trial court excused juror Foster based upon two defense arguments, one being the juror's exposure to pretrial publicity. Gissendaner argues that her challenges for cause concerning jurors Johnston and Mason were improperly denied, but we find that the trial court did not err in qualifying these jurors because their exposure to pretrial publicity was limited and their memories of what they had been exposed to were vague. Thus, 14 jurors of the 111 jurors questioned during voir dire were excused for cause based upon their exposure to pretrial publicity. We conclude that the number of excusals, particularly in light of the exacting standard applied by the trial court in reaching its decision to excuse certain jurors, is not indicative of the kind of inherently prejudicial environment requiring a change of venue. See Tharpe v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../322/3/index.html">262 Ga. 110</a></span>, 111 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../322/3/index.html">416 SE2d 78</a></span>) (1992); compare Jones v. State, 261 Ga. at 665-666 (1).</div><div class="casepar">3. We find that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike for cause the jurors discussed in Gissendaner's appeal.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Shortly before voir dire began, juror Mason had seen a newspaper article reporting on Gissendaner's upcoming trial, including the fact that a statement made by Gissendaner had been suppressed. However, Ms. Mason stated that she had "just skipped through" the article and could not remember details from it. She did vaguely recall something about "whether rights were read," but she had no recollection of the substance of Gissendaner's suppressed statement or anything else prejudicial to Gissendaner. Furthermore, she stated clearly that she would set aside any prior knowledge of the case and consider only the evidence presented at trial.</div><div class="casepar">A prospective juror need not be "totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved" in a criminal proceeding in order to be qualified to serve. Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 722 (81 SC 1639, 6 LE2d 751) (1961). Because Ms. Mason had very limited knowledge about Gissendaner's case, because it appears she was not prejudiced against Gissendaner, and particularly because she could not specifically recall any information that was to be excluded from evidence at trial, we conclude that the trial court properly qualified her to serve. See DeYoung v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../165/5/index.html">268 Ga. 780</a></span>, 784 (4) (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../165/5/index.html">493 SE2d 157</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Gissendaner contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to excuse juror Vandenakker for cause based upon his views on the death penalty. Mr. Vandenakker's responses initially evinced a preference for the death penalty in cases of "premeditated murder." However, his responses seeming to favor the death penalty were elicited by defense counsel's attempt to direct the juror's attention to a particular species of malice murder, namely malice murder where significant premeditation has occurred. In fact, defense counsel was properly admonished for doing so. See Carr v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../188/8/index.html">267 Ga. 547</a></span>, 554 (6) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../188/8/index.html">480 SE2d 583</a></span>) (1997) ("[I]t is improper to require the juror to enumerate hypothetical circumstances in which she might or might not vote to impose the death penalty"). Furthermore, Mr. Vandenakker indicated a willingness to consider all three sentencing options in light of mitigation evidence: "I would have to wait to hear [evidence in the sentencing phase] before I determined if it was a death penalty or life in prison or life in prison without parole." Because the juror was willing to consider any mitigating evidence and to consider all authorized sentencing options, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that his views on capital punishment would not " 'prevent or substantially impair . . . his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.' " Greene v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../144/5/index.html">268 Ga. 47</a></span>, 48-50 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../144/5/index.html">485 SE2d 741</a></span>) (1997) (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 424 (II) (105 SC 844, 83 LE2d 841) (1985)).</div><div class="casepar">(c) Gissendaner contends that the trial court improperly denied her motion to disqualify juror Schie. Contrary to Gissendaner's argument on appeal, a juror who expresses a leaning toward the death penalty is not necessarily unsuited for service. Mize v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../135/0/index.html">269 Ga. 646</a></span>, 652 (6) (d) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../135/0/index.html">501 SE2d 219</a></span>) (1998). Although juror Schie expressed an inclination toward the death penalty in murder cases, she qualified her expressed inclination by stating, "But I know there's different cases." She also stated repeatedly that she would consider all three sentencing options and that she was capable of voting in favor of a sentence less than death. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying this juror. Greene v. State, 268 Ga. at 48-50.</div><div class="casepar">Likewise, our review of the record indicates that neither juror Still's nor juror Love's views on capital punishment disqualified them for service. Although they both admitted some leaning toward the death penalty, they both also stated clearly and repeatedly that they would consider all three sentencing options and that they were capable of voting in favor of a sentence less than death.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Juror Winn acknowledged that he might, as surely all jurors might, be led to lean toward a determination of guilt or innocence based upon some of the evidence presented at trial but before all of the evidence had been presented. He stated: "I might come to some initial thought. I could see that happening, something might be said that would trigger a strong feeling one way or the other before the whole thing is over. That's entirely possible." Not only do we not find this acknowledgment troubling standing alone, we further note that the juror specifically stated that he would reserve final judgment until called upon for his verdict, although, in an admirable display of forthrightness, still acknowledging that "it could coincidentally be the same decision I thought of earlier." The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gissendaner's motion to excuse this juror for cause.</div><div class="casepar">(e) The record does not support Gissendaner's assertion that juror Beavers was predisposed toward the death penalty. Furthermore, Ms. Beavers stated clearly that she would consider all evidence and all three sentencing options and that she was capable of imposing a sentence less than death. We also find that Ms. Beavers's limited knowledge of the case drawn from her vague recollection of news reports did not require her disqualification. Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. at 722.</div><div class="casepar">(f) The trial court did not err in disqualifying juror Strong based upon her statement to the trial court, after some equivocation under questioning by counsel, that she did not know if she could impose the death penalty and based upon her becoming emotionally distraught during questioning on the topic. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing this juror. Greene v. State, 268 Ga. at 48-50; Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. at 424.</div><div class="casepar">4. Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly restrict Gissendaner's questioning on voir dire in general or with regard to the following jurors specifically discussed on appeal: Still; Beavers; Hampton; Strong; Mathis; Chappell; Smith; Derda; and Rumble. The trial court permitted a thorough examination of each of the jurors and properly sustained meritorious objections. "The scope of voir dire is largely left to the trial court's discretion, and the voir dire in this case was broad enough to ascertain the fairness and impartiality of the prospective jurors." Barnes v. State, 269 Ga. at 351-352 (10). The trial court was correct in preventing defense counsel from questioning jurors as to their willingness to impose the death penalty under specified hypothetical circumstances. Carr v. State, 267 Ga. at 554 (6) (a). The trial court did not err in restricting counsel's questions concerning the perceived credibility of law enforcement officers as compared with ordinary citizens. Henderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../657/9/index.html">251 Ga. 398</a></span>, 400 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../657/9/index.html">306 SE2d 645</a></span>) (1983). Nor did the trial court err in limiting repetitive, misleading, and irrelevant questions. Id. at 401.</div><div class="casepar">5. Gissendaner contends that the jury pools from which her grand jury and traverse jury were selected were created in a racially-discriminatory manner. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">Gissendaner's expert witness testified before the trial court that African-Americans comprised 5.1 percent of the population of the county according to the 1990 census but only 3.8 percent of registered voters. The expert concluded that Caucasians were selected from the voter registration list for inclusion in the jury pool in less than proportional numbers by the process of forced balancing. The expert witness attempted to bolster her argument that Caucasians were excluded in selecting the jury pools by suggesting that the percentage of African-Americans in the population of the county had even decreased to 4.6 percent since the 1990 census.</div><div class="casepar">Members of the county's jury commission testified that the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool was precisely the same as the percentage of African-Americans in the population in the county as determined by the 1990 census, and Gissendaner's expert testimony seemed to confirm their testimony. The method of forced balancing employed by the county in ensuring this proportionality was not unlawful. Sears v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../350/8/index.html">262 Ga. 805</a></span>, 806 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../350/8/index.html">426 SE2d 553</a></span>) (1993). Gissendaner also failed to demonstrate the exclusion of any arguably-cognizable group subsumed under the category of "other" in the county's voter registration records, the source from which the jury pools were drawn. We find that the trial court did not err in concluding that Gissendaner had failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of the jury pools from which her grand and traverse juries were drawn. See Bowen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../866/1/index.html">244 Ga. 495</a></span>, 500 (I) (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../866/1/index.html">260 SE2d 855</a></span>) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">Gissendaner, by recalculating figures appearing in an exhibit provided by her expert witness, now asserts on appeal that African-Americans actually comprised 7.4 percent of the registered voters in the county and, therefore, that it was African-Americans rather than Caucasian persons who were selected in less than proportional numbers. Without addressing the waiver issue involved in Gissendaner's reversal of argument, we conclude that, even assuming the validity of the figures set forth on appeal, the jury pools did not unlawfully exclude African-Americans. See Unified Appeal Procedure, Rule II (A) (6). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Trial Proceedings</div><div class="casepar">6.

Gissendaner argues that the trial court improperly limited her closing argument. Prior to an objection by the State, Gissendaner's counsel argued the following:</div><div class="casepar">[T]hrough the evidence, we have learned a lot about Doug Gissendaner. We know he was a healthy, strong individual. We know he outweighed Mr. Owen. We know he was tall. We know he worked as a mechanic, and we know that Doug Gissendaner had recently served in the United States Army. We know that in the United States Army he went through basic combat training. We know that he trained in combat arms. He was combat arms qualified. We know he was a tanker in the Army corps. We know he served in a combat theater in Desert Storm. And, therefore, we know that he had escape and evasion training.</div><div class="casepar">The State then raised an objection, which the trial court sustained stating, "Counsel can only comment on what's in evidence." Defense counsel's argument was again interrupted by an objection after counsel stated the following: "I would suggest to you as a reasonable inference from his service in the army and from his having served in a combat theater he was trained in how to defend himself in the woods." The trial court sustained the objection and stated, as part of an instruction that is difficult to interpret definitively in print: "That's testimony. It's not permissible."</div><div class="casepar">Counsel certainly are permitted to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial. Simmons v.

We need not address whether the specific inferences objected to in this case were reasonable, however, because we conclude that, regardless of whether the trial court's rulings were correct, Gissendaner was not harmed by them.

Defense counsel had already set out the pertinent aspects of the evidence, the jury was not instructed to disregard anything counsel had said, the trial court clearly stated that "[t]he jury may draw reasonable inference[s]," and defense counsel was later allowed to argue vigorously the theory that the victim could not have been murdered by Owen alone. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Gissendaner has not suffered any harm, even assuming any error by the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Early in his argument, the Senior Assistant District Attorney stated, "[W]hat you just heard from [defense counsel] has done a tremendous violence to the truth in this case." The prosecutor continued by further suggesting defense counsel's argument had failed to comport with the evidence and by referring to counsel's argument as "an insult to the truth." Defense counsel objected to the argument on the sole basis that it was a "personal attack."</div><div class="casepar">We are concerned that counsel should adhere to the highest standards of professionalism and proper courtroom decorum, see Davis v.

However, in this case, we do not conclude that the trial court erred in failing to make a clear ruling in Gissendaner's favor upon her one objection. Simmons v.

Even assuming the comment was improper, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the comment changed the jury's exercise of discretion in fixing her sentence at death, and, accordingly, we conclude that her sentence should not be disturbed.

Barnes v. State, 269 Ga. at 357-361 (27). But Barnes does not require the wholesale admission of all evidence contended to be mitigating without respect to its reliability and the rules of evidence.

Because the evidence rules exist for the purpose of winnowing out unreliable evidence, a trial court, in determining the admissibility of proffered evidence, must consider whether "substantial reasons exist[] to assume its reliability." Collier v. State, 244 Ga. at 567.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court in Gissendaner's case expressed a reasonable concern about the reliability of hearsay statements written by young children under unknown circumstances and influences. Additionally, the availability of the hearsay declarants to serve as witnesses at trial and the availability of their grandmother to testify that they had written to their mother both undermined Gissendaner's assertion that admission of the hearsay statements was critical to her defense.

Pretermitting the questions of whether the children's drawings contained in the letters were admissible or whether Gissendaner ever attempted to admit the drawings by themselves, we conclude that the drawings by themselves would have had no effect on the jury's deliberations.

Our review of the record also indicates that the prosecutor did not argue things not supported by the evidence, denigrate the place of mercy in the jury's deliberations, or improperly appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury.

Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (97 SC 2861, 53 LE2d 982) (1977) (concerning proportionality review of a death sentence under the United States Constitution). However, our review concerns whether the death penalty "is excessive per se" or if the death penalty is "only rarely imposed . . . or substantially out of line" for the type of crime involved and not whether there ever have been sentences less than death imposed for similar crimes.

Consequently, an argument, like one raised by Gissendaner, that a specific defendant in an unrelated murder case received a sentence less than death, while not irrelevant, cannot alone compel a finding of unlawful disproportionality. This Court views a particular crime against the backdrop of all similar cases in Georgia in determining if a given sentence is excessive per se or substantially out of line. When applicable, our "proportionality review of death sentences includes special consideration of the sentences received by co-defendants in the same crime." Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../617/7/index.html">253 Ga. 390</a></span>, 395 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../617/7/index.html">321 SE2d 710</a></span>) (1984) (citing Hall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../949/0/index.html">241 Ga. 252</a></span>, 258-260 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../949/0/index.html">244 SE2d 833</a></span>) (1978)).</div><div class="casepar">We are also directed by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/10/35/index.html">17-10-35</a></span> (c) (3) to consider "the defendant" in weighing the proportionality of a death sentence, and, therefore, the special individual characteristics of an appellant are appropriate for consideration. See Corn v. State, 240 Ga. at 141 (III) (2) (c) (discussing "low mental level and social maladjustment"). Our consideration of "the defendant" also requires a review of the aggravating factors presented at trial, including both past conduct and conduct after the crime.</div><div class="casepar">(b) In considering Gissendaner's role in the murder, we note several aggravating factors from the record. First, the record indicates that she was the moving force in the crime. Owen, her co-conspirator, testified that Gissendaner insisted her husband be murdered rather than divorced so that she would receive insurance money to pay off the mortgage on her home, although she learned after the murder that no such insurance policy was yet in force. Telephone records indicated that Gissendaner was with Owen when the two made plans for the murder from a bank of payphones and that Gissendaner called or paged Owen 65 times in the days leading up to the murder. On the night of the murder, Gissendaner drove Owen to her family's home, provided him with the murder weapons, and then left him inside the home to lie in wait for her husband while she left to establish an alibi. While out with her friends during the actual murder, Gissendaner resisted suggestions that the group reschedule their outing. When she returned, she immediately sent a numeric signal to Owen on his pager and then drove to the murder scene. Owen testified that she took a flashlight to inspect her husband's body to see that he was dead and assisted in burning her husband's automobile.</div><div class="casepar">Gissendaner's conduct after the night of the murder is also an appropriate concern for our sentence review, as it was an appropriate concern for the jury who sentenced her. Evidence at trial showed that Gissendaner, prior to her arrest, drove angrily toward a witness while declaring, "I ought to run the bitch over." While in jail, she wrote a letter and drew a map of her house in an effort to locate a person willing to accept money to commit perjury and to rob and beat witnesses.</div><div class="casepar">(c) We conclude that the deliberate, even insistent, manner in which Gissendaner pursued her husband's death, the fact that the murder was the unprovoked and calculated killing of a close family member, the fact that she arranged the murder to obtain money, and the fact that she attempted to avoid responsibility for her conduct by suborning perjury and orchestrating violence against witnesses all weigh heavily against her claim that the death penalty in her case is disproportionate. Our review of the sentences imposed in similar cases in Georgia reveals that the death sentence imposed in Gissendaner's case, considering both the gravity of her crime and the apparent depravity of her character, is not disproportionate. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/10/35/index.html">17-10-35</a></span> (c) (3). The cases appearing in the Appendix support this conclusion in that each involved the careful devising of a plan to kill, killing for the purpose of receiving something of monetary value, kidnapping with bodily injury, or causing or directing another to kill.</div><div class="casepar">at 260 (8). The evidence showed that she repeatedly raised the option of murder in conversations with her co-conspirator and that she planned the murder. She and not her co-conspirator stood primarily to gain financially from the murder. The murder was planned against her close family member. See DeYoung v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../165/5/index.html">268 Ga. 780</a></span>. Unlike her co-conspirator, who cooperated with authorities and confessed his guilt, Gissendaner devised a plan to suborn perjury and to do violence against witnesses. Id.; compare Moore v. State, 233 Ga. at 865. We also note that Gissendaner appealed to the jury's sense of justice by making the same argument of proportionality she makes to this Court and that the jury rejected the argument by its verdict. In light of all these circumstances, we conclude that Gissendaner's sentence was not impermissibly disproportionate to Owen's. See Carr v. State, 267 Ga. at 559 (11); see also Crowe v. State, 265 Ga. at 595 (24); compare Hall v. State, 241 Ga. at 259-260 (8).</div><div class="casepar">20. We find that the sentence of death in this case was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.

      The murder occurred on February 7, 1997. Gissendaner was indicted on April 30, 1997, by the Gwinnett County Grand Jury for malice murder and felony murder. The State filed written notice of its intent to seek the death penalty on May 6, 1997. Gissendaner's trial began on November 2, 1998, and the jury found her guilty of malice murder and felony murder on November 18, 1998. The felony murder conviction was vacated by operation of law. Malcolm v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../300/0/index.html">263 Ga. 369 (4) (434 SE2d 479) (1993)</a></span>; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span>. On November 19, 1998, the jury fixed Gissendaner's sentence at death. Gissendaner filed a motion for a new trial on December 16, 1998, which she amended on August 18, 1999, and which was denied on August 27, 1999. Gissendaner filed a notice of appeal on September 24, 1999. This appeal was docketed on November 9, 1999, and orally argued on February 29, 2000.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
