If a request for extradition is premised on the constitutional provision, one arrested and held on the governor's warrant issued in response to the request is entitled to habeas corpus relief upon establishing that he is not a fugitive from justice. Jackson v. Pittard, supra. See also Rutledge v. Tolbert, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../965/4/index.html">240 Ga. 116 (239 SE2d 520) (1977)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. Section 6 of the UCEA (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/25/index.html">17-13-25</a></span>) <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> was designed to cover cases not clearly reached by the constitutionally-based extradition laws; that is, where the accused could not technically be called a fugitive because he had committed a crime against the laws of a demanding state by doing acts outside of that state. Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (U.L.A.), Commissioners' Prefatory Note. Section 6 permits the governor of an asylum state to surrender to the governor of a requesting state a non-fugitive -- a person found in the asylum state who is accused by the requesting state of committing acts outside the boundaries of the requesting state that result in a crime in the requesting state. The effectiveness of Section 6 depends, not on a constitutional mandate, but upon comity between the states. Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (U.L.A.), Commissioners' Prefatory Note. When this provision is used as the basis for requesting interstate rendition of an accused, whether the accused was present in the requesting state at the time of the commission of the crime and fled there from are not at issue. Haupt v. Mitchell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../559/2/index.html">256 Ga. 844 (353 SE2d 345) (1987)</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. Section 10 of the UCEA provides that the target of the extradition proceedings may test the legality of his detention by applying for a writ of habeas corpus. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/30/index.html">17-13-30</a></span> (a). Where a habeas corpus petitioner is being held under a governor's warrant based on an extradition proceeding, the warrant, if valid on its face raises the presumption that the governor complied with the Constitution and law, and the burden is on the petitioner to show a "valid and sufficient reason" why the warrant should not be executed. Baldwin v. Grimes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/00/index.html">216 Ga. 390 (116 SE2d 207) (1960)</a></span>. Once the governor of the asylum state has issued a warrant of rendition, a court considering a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is limited to determining four "readily verifiable" facts: whether the extradition documents on their face are in order; whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state; whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and whether the petitioner is a fugitive. Michigan v. Doran, 439 U. S. 282, 289 (99 SC 530, 58 LE2d 521) (1978); Johnson v. Mitchell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../541/6/index.html">256 Ga. 339 (349 SE2d 186) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The basis of petitioner's habeas petition is her assertion that the warrant issued by the Georgia governor is invalid because both it and the Alabama governor's request for interstate rendition repeatedly refer to her as a "fugitive from justice" despite the fact that the State of Alabama has never contended that she committed the offenses in Alabama and then fled. The Alabama governor's request for interstate rendition of petitioner invoked the federal constitution and federal laws and averred that petitioner had committed the crimes in Alabama and had then fled to Georgia. The warrant issued by the Georgia governor acknowledged receipt of the Alabama governor's demand and supporting documents that charged petitioner with having committed the crimes in Alabama, and referred to petitioner six times as a "fugitive from justice" in ordering her arrest and deliverance to the Alabama governor's designated agent. The governor's warrant did not give either a constitutional or statutory basis for its issuance. Compare Mitchum v. Stynchcombe, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../137/13/index.html">227 Ga. 226 (179 SE2d 919) (1971)</a></span>; Johnstone v. Deyton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../117/68/index.html">233 Ga. 146 (210 SE2d 692) (1974)</a></span>; Watson v. Grimes, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/71/index.html">218 Ga. 631 (129 SE2d 795) (1963)</a></span>; Jackson v. Pittard, supra. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The discrepancy between the governor's warrant asserting that petitioner is a fugitive from justice (and therefore was present in Alabama when the crimes were committed) and the stipulation that Alabama is not contending that petitioner was in Alabama when the crimes were committed requires examination of the documents submitted in support of the request for rendition in an effort to establish the validity of the issuance of the warrant. See Mitchell v. Dodd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../105/12/index.html">238 Ga. 638 (1) (235 SE2d 15) (1977)</a></span>; Watson v. Grimes, supra. See also Cronauer v. State, <span class="casemissing">322 SE2d 862</span>, 868 (W.Va. 1984); State v. Soto, 423 S2d 362 (Fla. 1982). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Submitted to the governor of Georgia with the request for rendition of petitioner was the indictment charging her with knowingly distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or offering or agreeing to distribute obscene material, in violation of Alabama law. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> The application for extradition submitted to the Alabama governor by an Alabama district attorney asserted that the crimes were alleged to have been committed in Birmingham, Alabama, and that petitioner was a fugitive from justice believed to be in Georgia. Despite this assertion, the applicant struck through the portion of the pre-printed form which asserted petitioner had been in Alabama at the time of the commission of the crimes and made reference to the affidavit of an Alabama deputy attorney general who asserted that Alabama was not alleging that petitioner was in Alabama when the crimes allegedly occurred, but was the person responsible for the distribution of obscene material in Alabama. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> As was stated earlier, the Alabama governor's request for rendition asserted that petitioner was a fugitive from justice who had taken refuge in Georgia, and "pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and the Laws of the United States . . . ," requested her apprehension and deliverance to Alabama authorities.</div><div class="casepar">In its order denying relief, the habeas court acknowledged that the extradition pleadings contained "various defects." Relying on the presumption that the governor knew the law, the habeas court concluded that the governor had acted lawfully and exercised his discretion in issuing the warrant. We do not disturb the habeas court's findings of fact as they are supported by evidence; however, we must reverse the conclusion drawn therefrom as it is not based on sound legal footing.</div><div class="casepar">Whether the Georgia governor exercised his discretion in issuing the rendition warrant is the critical question in this case. When a rendition warrant is issued pursuant to the constitutional mandate (i.e., that the accused committed the crime in the demanding state and fled therefrom) in response to another state's request based on Section 6 of the UCEA (i.e., the accused is asserted to have committed acts outside the demanding state that intentionally result in a crime within the demanding state), or when it is established that the accused was not in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime, habeas corpus relief is granted because the accused has been denied the exercise of gubernatorial discretion to which he is entitled. Ex parte Holden, 719 SW2d 678 (Tx. App. 1986); Dutil v. Rice, 376 A2d 1119 (Conn. 1977); Koenig v. Poskochil, 469 NW2d 523 (Neb. 1991); Ex parte Kaufman, 39 NW2d 905 (S.D 1949). See also Watson v. Grimes, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/71/index.html">218 Ga. 631</a></span>, and Jackson v. Pittard, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../183/39/index.html">211 Ga. 427</a></span>. Thus, it is of paramount importance to the validity of a rendition warrant issued pursuant to a governor's discretionary authority that there be evidence that gubernatorial discretion was in fact exercised. See, e.g., Ratliff v. Thomas, 652 SW2d 919 (Tn. Crim. App. 1983) (case wherein Alabama governor's request for rendition under UCEA Section 6 was honored by Tennessee governor's issuance of a rendition warrant); State ex rel. Bradford v. Thomas, 653 SW2d 755 (Tn. Crim. App. 1983) (case wherein Georgia governor's request for rendition based on Section 6 was honored by Tennessee governor's issuance of a rendition warrant).</div><div class="casepar">The presumption that a public officer acted properly in the performance of his duty is rebutted when the contrary appears. Brantley v. Thompson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../168/33/index.html">216 Ga. 164 (115 SE2d 533) (1960)</a></span>. The language of the</div><div class="casepar">rendition warrant makes it clear that the Georgia governor issued it with the understanding that petitioner had committed a crime in Alabama and fled therefrom. The rendition warrant's repeated descriptions of petitioner as a fugitive and the Governor's assertion that the Alabama governor's request was accompanied by documents charging petitioner with a crime committed in Alabama make it apparent that the warrant was issued pursuant to the mandatory terms of the U. S. Constitution and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/23/index.html">17-13-23</a></span>. See Koenig v. Poskochil, supra, 469 NW2d 523. In light of the stipulation that petitioner had not committed a crime while in Alabama, petitioner's application for habeas corpus relief should have been granted. Watson v. Grimes, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../164/71/index.html">218 Ga. 631</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. Petitioner also contends the rendition warrant was not authorized inasmuch as she was not "substantially charged" by the demanding state because the Alabama indictment did not allege the date on which the offenses were alleged to have been committed and did not allege the method in which the offense was committed.</div><div class="casepar">[I]n cases involving extradition, it is a question of law open to judicial inquiry on habeas corpus, as to whether the person demanded was substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the demanding State. [Cits.] But the rule as thus stated applies to the sufficiency of the indictment or affidavit as a pleading, and not to extraneous evidence as to actual guilt.</div><div class="casepar">Ellis v. Grimes, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 51</span>, 54 (<span class="casemissing">30 SE2d 921</span>) (1944). A dateless indictment is valid under Alabama law unless time is "a material ingredient of the offense." Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/8/30/index.html">15-8-30</a></span>, Code 1975. Petitioner has made no suggestion that the crime of distribution of obscene material is a crime that falls within the statutory exception. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> The indictment contains several methods by which petitioner is alleged to have committed the crimes. The validity of the indictment is for the courts of the demanding state as it does not fall within the limited scope of review permitted the habeas courts of the asylum state.</div><div class="casepar">5. Whether the videotapes allegedly possessed and distributed by petitioner are obscene under Georgia's community standard and whether Alabama's prosecution of petitioner is pre-empted by federal laws criminalizing the interstate transportation and operation of obscene publications and businesses are also matters that do not fall within the limited scope of habeas corpus review of petitioner's detention pursuant to a governor's rendition warrant.

      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/22/index.html">17-13-22</a></span> states:Subject to this article, the Constitution of the United States, and any and all acts of Congress enacted in pursuance thereof, it is the duty of the Governor of this state to have arrested and delivered up to the executive authority of any other state any person charged in that state with treason, felony, or other crime, who has fled from justice and is found in this state.OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/23/index.html">17-13-23</a></span> states:No demand for the extradition of a person charged with a crime in another state shall be recognized by the Governor unless in writing, alleging, except in cases arising under Code Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/25/index.html">17-13-25</a></span>, that the accused was present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime and that thereafter he fled from the state, and accompanied by a copy of an indictment found . . . [which] substantially charge[s] the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of the state; and the copy of the indictment . . . must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/25/index.html">17-13-25</a></span> states:The Governor of this state may also surrender, on demand of the executive authority of any other state, any person in this state charged in such other state in the manner provided in Code Section  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/23/index.html">17-13-23</a></span> with committing an act in this state, or in a third state, intentionally resulting in a crime in the state whose executive authority is making the demand and the provisions of this article not otherwise inconsistent shall apply to such cases, even though the accused was not in that state at the time of the commission of the crime and has not fled therefrom.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      Several opinions issued by this court have led some to conclude that whether the accused was in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime is not recognized in any extradition habeas corpus proceeding in Georgia as a viable issue. These opinions generally cite Michigan v. Doran, 439 U. S. 282 (99 SC 530, 58 LE2d 521) (1978). In Doran, the U. S. Supreme Court held that the courts of an asylum state could not nullify the governor's grant of extradition on the ground that the requesting state had not established a factual basis for its charges supported by probable cause. Many of the Georgia opinions do not reflect the basis, constitutional or statutory, of the issuance of the governor's warrant. We can only conclude that the Georgia cases involve warrants issued pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/25/index.html">17-13-25</a></span> and its predecessor, Ga. Code Ann.  44-407, where the issue of presence within the demanding state is not an issue, or involved situations where a petitioner alleged that the demanding state had not presented sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to believe he was in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime. See, e.g., Willard v. Hutson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../768/0/index.html">247 Ga. 430 (276 SE2d 611) (1981)</a></span>; Miller v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../820/9/index.html">245 Ga. 137 (263 SE2d 441) (1980)</a></span>; Hutson v. Stoner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../846/9/index.html">244 Ga. 52 (257 SE2d 539) (1979)</a></span>; Larsen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../875/2/index.html">244 Ga. 767 (262 SE2d 97) (1979)</a></span>; Frazier v. Rutledge, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../881/8/index.html">243 Ga. 39 (252 SE2d 465) (1979)</a></span>; Smith v. Hart, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../883/3/index.html">243 Ga. 59 (252 SE2d 470) (1979)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      Petitioner's habeas corpus petition to the second governor's warrant was granted on this ground. That habeas court found "a significant factual distinction" between the Alabama governor's extradition request couched in the mandatory language of the constitutional provision and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/22/index.html">17-13-22</a></span> and <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/23/index.html">17-13-23</a></span>, and the parties' stipulation wherein the State of Alabama said it did not contend that petitioner violated the laws of Alabama while in that state.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note8" href="#source8">8</a></span>&nbsp;
      In order to effectuate the uniform act's general purpose "to make uniform the laws of those states which enact it[,]" (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/13/49/index.html">17-13-49</a></span>), judicial decisions from other states interpreting their codification of the uniform law are "particularly persuasive." State of Ga. v. McKenna, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../604/3/index.html">253 Ga. 6</a></span>, 9 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../604/3/index.html">315 SE2d 885</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      The indictment's failure to allege the place where the illegal conduct occurred does not void the extradition. State v. Soto, supra, 423 S2d 362.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;
      In State ex rel. Walker v. Ramsey County Dist. Court, 368 NW2d 28 (Minn. App. 1985), the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that statements made in the application for</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note11" href="#source11">11</a></span>&nbsp;
      For extradition purposes, an accused who is alleged to be a fugitive from justice and who wishes to challenge that allegation is entitled to a date in order to establish whether he was in the demanding state at that time. in light of the stipulation that petitioner was not in Alabama when the offenses were allegedly committed, she is not in need of the dates on which the crimes were alleged to have been committed. Had she been in need of such, the date asserted in the application for request for rendition (February 26, 1992) would have sufficed.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Maloy &amp; Jenkins, W.
