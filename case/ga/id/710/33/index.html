Trustees of an unincorporated religious society, holding title in themselves to the society's real property, may bring a dispossessory proceeding (or distress warrant for rent) through their secretary and agent against a tenant in possession of the property who is holding over and beyond his term and who refuses to pay rent.</div><div class="casepar">2. The description of the property in the affidavit upon which the proceeding was based and in the judgment was sufficient to identify the property. Williams v. Gilly, <span class="casemissing">133 Ga. 546</span> (66 S. E. 263).</div><div class="casepar">3. Where, in such a proceeding as indicated above, the only issue submitted to the jury for determination is the reasonable rental value of the property, and the verdict on this issue is authorized by the evidence, any errors in admitting evidence not bearing upon that issue must be treated as having been waived, where it appears that it was by agreement of counsel for both parties that the single issue was submitted to the jury.</div><div class="casepar">Upon the affidavit of Johnny Oliphant as secretary and agent of the Trustees of Loftin's Camp Ground, the following distress warrant was issued: "Georgia, Jefferson County. To Any Lawful Officer to Execute and Return: Johnny Oliphant having made oath before me that he is secretary and agent for the trustees of Loftin's Camp Ground and that Anthony Jackson of said county is indebted to Will Brown, Willis Oliphant, Tom Little, Albert Lucian Little, Dolphus Washington, Johnny Oliphant, Garvin Dawson, Robert Washington, and Oliver Way, as trustees of Loftin's Camp Ground, in the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) for the rent of one dwelling house on one lot of land in the 77th District G. M. of said county, containing one acre, more or less, and being bounded as follows: North by lands now or formerly belong to C. A. Matthews, east by land of the Odd Fellows, south by land of the Odd Fellows, and west by the Louisville and Augusta Public Road, and that said rent is now due and unpaid. These are therefore to command you to levy on and sell sufficiency of the estate, both real and person of the said Anthony Jackson to make the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) and two dollars and seventy-five cents ($2.75) cost on this warrant and all future costs, and have the said sums also this warrant before me at the next justice court to be held in and for the 82 District G. M. on the 28th day of June next to render to the said Will Brown, Willis Oliphant, Tom Little, Albert Lucian Little, Dolphus Washington, Johnny Oliphant, Garvin Dawson, Robert Washington, and Oliver Way, as trustees of Loftin's Camp Ground."</div><div class="casepar">The sheriff of the county levied upon all the household and kitchen furniture and cooking utensils as the property of Anthony Jackson.</div><div class="casepar">To the distress warrant Anthony Jackson filed the following counter-affidavit: "Now comes Anthony Jackson, the defendant named in the above stated dispossessory warrant proceeding, and files this his counter-affidavit as provided by law, and swears: 1. That defendant and deponent herein is not holding said premises over and beyond any term of rental entered into by him with said plaintiffs; 2. That deponent is not indebted to plaintiffs for rent in any sum, and that he is not holding the premises illegally from either of said plaintiffs; 3. That there has never been any contract of rental entered into by deponent with either of said plaintiffs; 4. That he is the owner of the premises described in the affidavit upon which said dispossessory warrant was issued; 5. That deponent holds said property under a deed from Maryland L. Brown, as executor of the estate of John Brown, Sr., dated January 4, 1936, which deed was executed in pursuance of a bond for title dated January 4, 1934, signed by John Brown to this deponent, which said deed and bond for title are of record in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Jefferson County, Georgia; 6. That deponent went into possession of said premises under the bond for title above referred to, and also has been in possession under the warranty deed above referred to, which possession has been open, notorious and adverse against the world, he having erected a home upon the premises described in said deed and has occupied the same as a home ever since; 7. That deponent has paid all taxes upon the said property, and paid for the erection of said home which is worth at least $1000 and he has title to said premises by said deed above mentioned, as well as adverse possession; 8. Deponent contends that the plaintiffs named in said dispossessory warrant have no legal authority to proceed as they are doing either for themselves or as trustees for Loftin's Camp Ground; and, 9. Deponent prays that the issues raised in this counter-affidavit be tried by a jury in the Superior Court of Jefferson County, as the law in such cases provides."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant made a motion in arrest of judgment on the grounds: "(1) There are no proper parties plaintiff before the court authorized to bring such proceedings in that the proceedings as brought do not import any legal entity authorized by law to bring the same. The affidavit which is the foundation of the proceedings, neither imports a corporation or an individual, or a partnership, or an unincorporated organization who has complied with the law laid down in Code  22-409, 22-410, 22-411, 22-412, and 22-414; therefore, the judgment entered in said proceedings is void and should be arrested. (2) The description of the property in said affidavit to obtain such dispossessory warrant is too indefinite and therefore void. (3) The illegality of said judgment constitutes an unamendable defect which appears upon the face of the record in said case." This motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant also made a motion for new trial, based on the general grounds and five special grounds, which was overruled and he excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. By an act of the General Assembly of 1805 (See Cobb's New Digest of the Statute Laws of Georgia, p. 899), presently codified as Code  22-409, it is provided: "All deeds of conveyance heretofore made, and which may hereafter be made, to any person or persons, for any lots of land within this State, to any church or religious society, or to trustees for the use of such church or religious society, for the purpose of erecting churches or meeting houses, are, and shall be deemed and taken to be, good and valid, and available in law for the intents, uses, and purposes contained in said deeds of conveyance; and all lots of land so conveyed shall be fully and absolutely vested in such church or religious society, or in their respective trustees, for the uses and purposes in said deed expressed; to be holden to them, or their trustees, for their use by succession, according to the mode of church government or rules of discipline exercised by such churches or religious societies respectively." (Emphasis added.) By the terms of the same act, presently codified as Code  22-411, it is also provided: "Every church or religious society is authorized to fill all vacancies which may happen in the said trusts by death, removal, expulsion, or otherwise; and when any vacancy shall be filled, the same shall be certified under the hand of the person presiding in the society, and according to the form of government or discipline practiced by said church or society, which certificate shall express the name of the person appointed to fill the vacancy and the name of the person in whose place he shall be appointed; and the said certificate being recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the land lies, the person so appointed to fill such vacancy shall be as fully vested with such trust as if a party to and named in the original deed: Provided, the failure so to have recorded the certificate of appointment aforesaid shall not operate to disqualify, or render incompetent to act in any proceeding, any trustee duly appointed by the form of government or discipline practiced by the church or society having the power to appoint trustees." (Emphasis added.)</div><div class="casepar">It seems to be conceded, if not stipulated, by counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant that Lofton Camp Ground is a religious society, and under the provisions of the act of 1805 quoted above, deeds to land made to trustees of such societies are valid; and trustees of such societies, whether original trustees or successor trustees are empowered to act for such societies in relation to such property, whether the appointment of the trustees has been recorded or not.</div><div class="casepar">By the provisions of Code  61-301 and 61-402, agents, attorneys in fact, or attorneys at law, may proceed for and in behalf of landlords against tenants to collect rent past due or to recover possession of the premises. The present proceeding was brought by Oliphant as secretary and agent of the trustees of the Lofton Camp Ground, and was therefore, properly construed, a proceeding by the trustees, not by the unincorporated religious society itself. Thompson v. Jacobs, <span class="casemissing">8 Ga. App. 499</span> (69 S. E. 921). See also, in this connection, Kelsey v. Jackson, <span class="casemissing">123 Ga. 113</span> (50 S. E. 951); Josey v. Union Loan &amp; Trust Co., <span class="casemissing">106 Ga. 608</span> (32 S. E. 628); and, for a case squarely in point upon nearly every question presented here, see Godfrey v. Walker, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. 563</span>, where it is said: "Where there are trustees of churches, we deem them the proper parties to bring suit, or to defend them, or to serve with process or papers. The affidavit in the present proceeding does not show upon its face that the persons named therein are not trustees of Lofton Camp Ground as alleged, and the trial court did not err in denying the motion in arrest of judgment on the ground that there was no proper party plaintiff--that the plaintiffs were not legal entities.</div><div class="casepar">2. Headnote 2 requires no elaboration.</div><div class="casepar">3. While the motion for new trial assigns error upon the trial court's admitting in evidence the deed from the defendant to the trustees of the Lofton Camp Ground, and the testimony of certain witnesses that they were trustees of Lofton Camp Ground, it appears from the brief of evidence, signed by counsel for both parties and approved by the court, that the only issue submitted for the jury's determination was the reasonable rental value of the premises. The evidence authorized the jury's verdict upon this score, and the errors assigned in the motion for new trial, not bearing upon the rental value, must, under these circumstances, be treated as waived. It follows that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Gardner, P.
