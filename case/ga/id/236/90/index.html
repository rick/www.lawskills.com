Muscogee Superior Court. Before Judge McCombs, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Lloyd R. Smith appeals from denial of his motion for new trial following his conviction of aggravated assault against his then wife.<span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">1. Smith's second enumeration is that the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict on the aggravated assault count, thereby raising the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">Viewed with all inferences in favor of the jury's verdict, it was that Angela Smith and Smith were married in December 1994, shortly before he was chaptered out of the army.</div><div class="casepar">On January 26, 1995, the two began arguing over money at their apartment and continued arguing as Ms. Smith drove her car on the expressway with Smith in the passenger seat. Ms. Smith refused to tell Smith what she had done with money he had given her for rent and Smith became angry. Smith then struck her in the eye with his fist, causing a blowout fracture of her eye. Ms. Smith then went to her friend's apartment where she retrieved the money. The friend called police and Smith left in Ms. Smith's car. Smith contended the injury was caused by Ms. Smith's hitting her head on the rear view mirror, although he pled guilty to simple battery as a result of the incident. This incident was introduced as a similar offense and is the subject of Division 2.</div><div class="casepar">Smith and Ms. Smith reunited after the January incident, although their relationship did not improve. On May 20, 1995, Smith and Ms. Smith were visiting some friends when an argument began between Smith and another man. Smith believed the man had a gun and called the police who responded. The gun turned out to be a starter pistol. Ms. Smith went to the police and asked them to ask Smith to leave the apartment. The police discussed this with him and he agreed to leave. Around 10:00 p.m., Kelly, Ms. Smith's brother, agreed to take Smith where he wanted to go because he did not want Ms. Smith to have to take him.</div><div class="casepar">Ms. Smith went to sleep in her living room around midnight after putting her son to bed. Because she was nervous about Smith's returning, she placed a love seat in front of the locked front door. Around 5:00 a.m., Ms. Smith heard a key in the lock and the love seat was pushed aside by Smith, who said he wanted to talk. Although she asked him to leave, he did not. Smith had a cold hard look on his face and Ms. Smith was afraid. In a few minutes, Smith got up and went into the kitchen, returning with a hammer. Ms. Smith was sitting on the sofa and Smith approached her and struck her on the side of the head with the hammer. After engaging in the acts that were the subject of the remaining counts, Smith left the apartment in Ms. Smith's car.</div><div class="casepar">Although Smith argues that this incident was an accident caused by their struggle for the hammer and that inconsistencies in Ms. Smith's testimony required a directed verdict, such inconsistencies went only to the credibility of Ms. Smith, a matter inherently for the jury's determination. Price v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../258/42/index.html">228 Ga. App. 155</a></span>, 157 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../258/42/index.html">491 SE2d 210</a></span>) (1997). This court cannot substitute its judgment on the issue of credibility for that of the jury. Luke v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/20/index.html">222 Ga. App. 203</a></span>, 206 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../274/20/index.html">474 SE2d 49</a></span>) (1996).</div><div class="casepar">The testimony of a single witness, even if inconsistent, is legally sufficient as long as there is some competent evidence to make out the State's case, as there was here. Smith v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../276/66/index.html">222 Ga. App. 887 (1) (476 SE2d 653) (1996)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. Smith contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the January incident, which resulted in a misdemeanor guilty plea to simple battery, in the trial of the felony aggravated assault incident in March, because the two incidents were not sufficiently similar under the third prong of Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../377/9/index.html">261 Ga. 640</a></span>, 643 (2) (d) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../377/9/index.html">409 SE2d 649</a></span>) (1991).</div><div class="casepar">Pursuant to the State's notice of intention to introduce the prior act, the court conducted the hearing and made the findings required by Williams, supra, concluding, as do we, that the similarities were sufficient for introduction into evidence for purposes of proving Smith's course of conduct and bent of mind. Both incidents involved physical assaults upon his wife's head after arguments, both resulted in serious injuries to her, both were followed by his leaving the location of the incident, and his establishment of another explanation for her injuries that negated his responsibility.</div><div class="casepar">"The rule allowing the admission of similar transaction evidence is usually applied more liberally with evidence of prior attempts by the accused to commit the same crime upon the victim of the offense for which he stands charged. Certain otherwise inexplicable assaults, such as occur in a series of incidents of wife or child abuse, particularly lend themselves to this exception to the 'other offenses' rule on questions of both identity and motive." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Parcell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../350/14/index.html">198 Ga. App. 439 (1) (401 SE2d 628) (1991)</a></span>. The evidence was properly admitted.</div><div class="casepar">Herring v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../270/63/index.html">224 Ga. App. 809</a></span>, 814 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../270/63/index.html">481 SE2d 842</a></span>) (1997). See also Smith v. State, <span class="casemissing">232 Ga. App. 290</span>, 294-295 (1) (<span class="casemissing">501 SE2d 523</span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">The fact that the prior offense was a misdemeanor and the one on trial is a felony is not an obstacle to its use for this purpose. See Rodriguez v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/45/index.html">211 Ga. App. 256</a></span>, 258 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/45/index.html">439 SE2d 510</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this prior act.</div><div class="casepar">3. Smith's third enumeration is that the trial court erred in not giving, without a request to charge, a charge on the defense of accident, based on Metts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../310/40/index.html">210 Ga. App. 197</a></span>, 198 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../310/40/index.html">435 SE2d 525</a></span>) (1993). As reflected therein, when the defendant's sole defense is accident, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> it is error to fail to give appropriate instructions on it, even without request.</div><div class="casepar">A review of the evidence here, however, reveals that Smith's own version of the incident belies the accident defense. He told Detective McClenton that Ms. Smith assaulted him with the hammer first, they wrestled, and then "I made the hammer go back and strike her, trying to take it." (Emphasis supplied.) Smith testified at trial that he refused to leave the apartment because he had nowhere else to go. As he was trying to push past Ms. Smith to go to the bedroom, she started hitting him with the hammer, they wrestled, and "[s]he got popped in the head with the hammer.</div><div class="casepar">Therefore, the defense of accident was not Smith's sole defense since he acknowledged intending to strike her and failure to give such a charge without request was not error. See Virgil v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../260/99/index.html">227 Ga. App. 96</a></span>, 98 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../260/99/index.html">488 SE2d 694</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">4. Finally, Smith contends that his trial counsel was ineffective and seeks a new trial on that basis.</div><div class="casepar">The sole basis argued here for this claim is that trial counsel failed to request a charge on Smith's sole defense of accident, which was not error, as held in Division 3. Further, this argument was not presented to the trial court during Smith's motion for new trial hearing, only that a request for instruction on lesser included charge to aggravated assault should have been made. Therefore, there is nothing for us to review in this regard.</div><div class="casepar">J. Gray Conger, District Attorney, Melvin E.
