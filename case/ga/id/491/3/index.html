Catoosa Superior Court. Before Judge Tucker.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The appellant, Larry Eugene Moon, was convicted by a jury in Catoosa County of murder and armed robbery. He was sentenced to death for the murder. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">At 10:30 p.m. on November 24, 1984, the victim, Ricky Callahan, drove a 1978 Ford LTD to a convenience store to purchase headache medicine for his wife. He never returned. His body was found the next morning in a chert pit, shot twice in the head.</div><div class="casepar">Larry Moon left his motel room late in the evening of November 24, 1984, for the announced purpose of making a telephone call. He returned later, driving the victim's car. He removed approximately $60 from the victim's wallet, and discarded the wallet. Moon and his companion then drove to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where she left him.</div><div class="casepar">On November 26, 1984, a 1980 Buick Riviera was stolen from the parking lot of a shopping mall in Decatur, Alabama. The Callahan car was discovered abandoned three miles west of Decatur, Alabama, on November 28, 1984.</div><div class="casepar">On December 14, 1984, a 1982 Buick LeSabre was stolen from a parking lot in Oneida, Tennessee. The local police knew the owner and the car, and it was soon spotted in Oneida. After a high-speed chase through the surrounding countryside, the police apprehended the car and its driver, Larry Moon. A number of guns were recovered from the interior of the stolen automobile, including one later identified as the murder weapon in this case.</div><div class="casepar">Soon after Moon's capture, the police recovered from another parking lot in Oneida the 1980 Buick Riviera that had been stolen in Decatur, Alabama. The keys to this car were found on Moon when he was arrested. Inside this car were cassette tapes that had been inside Callahan's Ford LTD before it was stolen.</div><div class="casepar">At the sentencing phase of the trial, the state offered additional evidence about Moon's activities before and after Ricky Callahan was murdered.</div><div class="casepar">On November 15, 1984, Moon shot and killed Jimmy Hutcheson at Brown's Tavern in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He left Chattanooga and went to Catoosa County, Georgia, where the Callahan homicide occurred on November 24, 1984. He returned to Chattanooga and at 3:00 a.m. on December 1, 1984, he robbed at gunpoint Peeper's Adult Bookstore in Chattanooga. While there, he kidnapped Terry Lee Elkins (who was a female impersonator). Moon drove back to Georgia on Interstate 75, left the interstate and drove fifteen miles into the country, stopped the car, and sodomized his captive by the side of the road, threatening to kill him if he refused to submit.</div><div class="casepar">Moon returned his captive to Chattanooga, and drove to Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Shortly after midnight on December 2, 1984, Moon (still driving the Buick Riviera he had stolen in Alabama) offered a ride to Darryl Ehrlanger and her fiance Thomas DeJosa. She worked in a restaurant in Gatlinburg and had just gotten off work. Moon took them almost to their home outside of Gatlinburg, stopped the car, and tried to drag Ehrlanger out of the car. When DeJosa attempted to rescue her, Moon shot him. DeJosa ordered her to run into the woods. When she did, Moon fired several shots at her. He then shot DeJosa three more times and left. By the time Ehrlanger reached DeJosa, he was dead.</div><div class="casepar">On December 7, 1984, Moon was back in Chattanooga, where he robbed at gunpoint a convenience store owned by Ray York, taking over $900 from the store as well as the owner's billfold and his .357 magnum pistol. The pistol was recovered from inside the car Moon was driving when he was arrested.</div><div class="casepar">1. The court did not deliver one of Moon's requested charges on circumstantial evidence. However, the principles of the requested charge were covered in substance by the charge delivered by the trial court. The refusal to give the exact language of Moon's request was not error. Price v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../413/20/index.html">180 Ga. App. 215 (2) (348 SE2d 740) (1986)</a></span>. As the court's charge covered the principles of the requested charge, Moon was not misled to his detriment by the court's somewhat ambiguous indication that the requested instruction would be given. Compare Goins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../424/78/index.html">177 Ga. App. 536 (339 SE2d 790) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. From the time of his arrest until shortly before this trial, Moon remained in Tennessee while some of the criminal charges pending there were disposed of. In February of 1987, Moon was transferred to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tennessee, to begin serving a life sentence. The district attorney in this case filed detainers and a "Request for Temporary Custody" under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD). See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/42/6/20/index.html">42-6-20</a></span> et seq. Tennessee authorities suggested that since the death penalty was being sought in the Catoosa County case, Georgia should pursue Moon's return by means other than the IAD. An executive agreement was signed by the governors of Tennessee and Georgia providing for Moon's return and providing that if Moon did not receive a death sentence, Moon should be returned to Tennessee following the conclusion of the Georgia proceedings. Moon contested his extradition until August of 1987. Thereafter, on August 21, 1987, while Moon was still in Tennessee, the trial judge and the attorneys in this case met to discuss a date for trial. After allowing for time to dispose of the many anticipated pre-trial motions and resolving schedule conflicts, the parties agreed to a tentative trial date of January 11, 1988. Although Moon's attorney indicated at this hearing that Moon's presence would not be necessary for a month or two, he soon obtained an ex parte order for Moon's immediate return to Georgia. Moon was brought into Georgia on September 3, 1987. On January 5, 1988, Moon's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss for failure to try him within 120 days of his return to Georgia pursuant to the provisions of the IAD. He now contends the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The IAD is "a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact the interpretation of which presents a question of federal law." Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 442 (101 SC 703, 66 LE2d 641) (1981).</div><div class="casepar">The central provisions of the Agreement are Art. III and Art. IV. . . .</div><div class="casepar">Article IV provides the means by which a prosecutor who has lodged a detainer against a prisoner in another state can secure the prisoner's presence for disposition of the outstanding charges. Once he has filed a detainer against the prisoner, the prosecutor can have him made available by presenting to the officials of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated a "written request for temporary custody or availability. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">United States v. Mauro, 436 U. S. 340, 351 (98 SC 1834, 56 LE2d 329) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">If a prosecutor uses Article IV to obtain a prisoner from another state,</div><div class="casepar">trial shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/42/6/20/index.html">42-6-20</a></span> (Art. IV (c)).</div><div class="casepar">(b) The state argues that the IAD does not apply because it abandoned its attempt to obtain the defendant through the IAD and instead obtained his return by executive agreement and extradition. However, it is not clear that the provisions of the IAD can be avoided once a detainer is filed. Compare United States v. Mauro, supra. See also United States v. Roy, 771 F2d 54 (2nd Cir. 1985); State ex rel. Bailey v. Shepard, 584 F2d 858, 862 (8th Cir. 1978). We need not decide this issue, however. Although the state may not ignore the 120-day limit in Article IV of the IAD, the trial court may grant any "necessary or reasonable continuance. Moreover, the 120-day limit may be "tolled whenever and for so long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial," OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/42/6/20/index.html">42-6-20</a></span> (Art. VI (a)), and this language has been interpreted to " 'exclude all those periods of delay occasioned by the defendant.' United States v. Scheer, 729 F2d 164, 168 (2nd Cir. 1984)." United States v. Roy, supra at 59. Finally, the rights created by the IAD are "nonjurisdictional and waivable." Kowalak v. United States, 645 F2d 534, 536 (6th Cir. 1981). Since the IAD guarantees are of statutory rather than constitutional proportions, "a defendant need not know of the Act to effectively waive its provisions," United States v. Odom, 674 F2d 228, 230 (4th Cir. 1982), and waiver may be shown by agreeing to a trial date set outside the 120-day limit. United States v. Hines, 717 F2d 1481 (4th Cir. 1983).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, a trial date was set with the agreement of the defendant's attorney. Thereafter, Moon was returned to Georgia earlier than anticipated, and then filed over 60 motions, which necessarily had to be determined before trial. Compare United States v. Scheer, supra at 168-9. Moon did not raise any objections to the date set for trial until one day after the 120-day period had elapsed. In these circumstances, Moon cannot now complain that the state missed by one week beginning his trial within 120 days of his return to Georgia. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">(c) Moon contends that under the IAD he must be returned to Tennessee to complete his sentences there before his sentence of death can be carried out in Georgia. He seeks the invalidation of the aforementioned "Executive Agreement" which provides otherwise.</div><div class="casepar">Article V (e) of the IAD provides: "At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">The IAD sets forth its purpose in Article l, noting that since</div><div class="casepar">charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation,</div><div class="casepar">the contracting states agree</div><div class="casepar">it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges. . . .</div><div class="casepar">A "further purpose" of the IAD is to provide "cooperative procedures" to carry out the Act's policies.</div><div class="casepar">Moon contends the IAD requires his return to Tennessee, without exception or qualification. We disagree. Moon's trial provided the "expeditious and orderly disposition" of the charges underlying the detainer, and since Moon now is under a death sentence, he has no recognizable interest in "programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation." The states of Georgia and Tennessee have by "cooperative procedures" agreed that Moon should stay in Georgia if a death sentence was imposed in this case, and we find nothing in the IAD that requires the invalidation of this agreement.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Any issue concerning the denial of a pre-trial appeal of any IAD issue is now moot.</div><div class="casepar">(e) The trial court did not err by denying the defendant's motion to disqualify the district attorney for conflict of interest where the only conflict of interest alleged was that the district attorney might be civilly liable to the defendant for violating his rights under the IAD. Compare Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../473/4/index.html">258 Ga. 305 (2) (368 SE2d 232) (1988)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. The jury found as a statutory aggravating circumstance that the offense of murder in this case was committed by a person with a record of conviction for three capital felonies: (a) The armed robbery of Ray York; (b) the armed robbery of Peeper's Bookstore; and (c) the kidnapping with bodily injury of Terry Lee Elkins. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (1). Moon contends this finding was invalid because he was convicted for these crimes in Tennessee.</div><div class="casepar">The  b (1) statutory aggravating circumstance may be established by proof of out-of-state convictions that, as here, clearly are comparable to Georgia capital felony offenses. See Cobb v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../858/7/index.html">244 Ga. 344 (20) (260 SE2d 60) (1979)</a></span>. The  b (1) finding is supported beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence, which included not only copies of the convictions, but also testimony from the victims of the crimes.</div><div class="casepar">4. The jury also found that the offense of murder in this case was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of the armed robbery of Ricky Callahan. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (2). Moon contends this circumstance fails to narrow the class of persons eligible for a death sentence where a defendant is convicted of both murder and armed robbery. This contention is without merit, for reasons set forth in Ford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../516/0/index.html">257 Ga. 461 (1) (360 SE2d 258) (1987)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The  b (2) finding is supported by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/35/index.html">17-10-35</a></span> (c) (2).</div><div class="casepar">5. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found Moon guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offenses of murder and armed robbery. The evidence supports the conviction for murder and armed robbery. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">6. Moon's two appointed attorneys complain they were inadequately compensated for trying this case. Absent any proof that, as a result of inadequate compensation, Moon was denied effective assistance of counsel, attorney fees are not properly in issue on this appeal. Compare In re Whatley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../539/0/index.html">256 Ga. 289 (347 SE2d 602) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. Where a competent witness is sworn properly and testifies before the grand jury, and where the defendant is thereafter found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a trial jury, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the indictment is not open to question. Felker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">252 Ga. 351</a></span> (2 a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">314 SE2d 621</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">Nor is it a ground to dismiss the indictment that police officers are on the grand jury list, but not on the grand jury which returned the indictment, even if we were to agree that police officers should not serve on the grand jury. Compare Narramore v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../409/94/index.html">181 Ga. App. 254 (351 SE2d 643) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Moon has not shown any unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in Catoosa County. Ingram v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../625/0/index.html">253 Ga. 622</a></span> (1 c) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../625/0/index.html">323 SE2d 801</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">Absent proof that any cognizable group was underrepresented on the grand jury list, the mere fact that the jury commissioners exercised their subjective judgment in selecting names for the list provides no ground for challenge to the list. Parks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../593/8/index.html">254 Ga. 403 (6) (330 SE2d 686) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">9. The trial court's death-qualification rulings are " 'within the deference due the trial judge's determination.' Jefferson v.

One of the jurors (a nurse) persuaded him that he should go to the emergency room. This juror and another drove Walker to the hospital. Walker remained fully conscious at all times and the two jurors never left his sight. The jurors did not discuss the case with anyone, including Walker. The situation was brought to the court's attention the next morning. The court offered to excuse both jurors and replace them with alternates, but only if the defendant accepted the offer before the parties or the court learned the identity of the two jurors. Otherwise, the court would excuse the two jurors only if their testimony or that of the bailiff showed any improper communications. The defendant's attorneys declined the offer to excuse, but moved for a mistrial, which the court denied.</div><div class="casepar">The testimony presented at the hearing on this issue showed no violation of jury sequestration or improper communication, and the trial court did not err by denying the motion for a mistrial, especially after the defendant declined the opportunity to remove the two jurors.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Moon also complains the trial court erred by sequestering the jury overnight in East Ridge, Tennessee. There are only two motels in Catoosa County. After the jury complained of its accommodations at one of them, the trial court found conditions at this motel to be "deplorable" and conditions at the other to be even worse. The court announced to the parties that he intended to sequester the jury in a motel six miles away in East Ridge, Tennessee. Attorneys for both sides and the defendant responded that they had no objection to the out-of-state sequestration In these circumstances, no error has been shown. Compare Jones v.

Dugger, 823 F2d 1439 (VI) (11th Cir. 1987), Moon now argues the trial court erred by shackling him without a hearing and that his death sentence should be reversed.</div><div class="casepar">In Elledge v. Dugger, as here, the trial judge received information from security personnel regarding the defendant's behavior, and ordered the defendant shackled during the sentencing proceedings. However, unlike here, "Elledge was denied the required procedure when the court refused him an adequate opportunity to challenge the untested information that served as the basis for the shackling." Elledge v. Dugger, supra at 1451.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, the defendant's attorney raised the issue of shackling briefly during the course of a hearing on another matter outside the presence of the jury, while the parties were waiting for a witness to enter the courtroom. The entire discussion of the issue fills just over two pages of the transcript. The defendant did not request a hearing, or attempt to refute the information on which the court acted.</div><div class="casepar">In these circumstances, the defendant may not now complain that he was denied "an adequate opportunity" to be heard on the issue, or that his shackling was unnecessary.</div><div class="casepar">13. Evidence regarding Moon's theft of two automobiles following the murder of Ricky Callahan was properly admitted. In each case, a car was stolen from the same area in which the previous car was abandoned, and this evidence directly connected Moon to the theft and abandonment of the Callahan car.

Before charging the jury at the penalty phase of the trial, the court apologized for the delay, explaining that the charge was part of the case which "not only do you look at, but the appellate court looks at, and so, it must be in proper form and comply with the law in all respects." Although Moon did not object at trial to this comment, he now argues the comment could have had the "same effect" as the prosecutor's argument in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (105 SC 2633, 86 LE2d 231) (1985). In Caldwell, the prosecutor, with the agreement of the trial judge, informed the jury that it need not feel responsible for its verdict, as it would be reviewed by the appellate courts. Given the limited nature of appellate review, this argument was misleading, and was condemned by the U. S. Supreme Court as designed to diminish the jury's perception of its responsibility to reach a just verdict.</div><div class="casepar">The comment in this case did not imply that anything other than the court's charge would be reviewed, and the jury was specifically instructed that its verdict would be carried out and that the court had "no power to reduce your sentence in any way."

Byers (Moon's companion living with him at the time of the crime) testified at trial about her traffic arrest for improper tags.

The state also introduced in aggravation certified copies of Tennessee convictions based on guilty pleas showing the commission by Moon of seven burglaries, three aggravated assaults, one shoplifting offense, and one escape. Moon objected to the admission of these offenses on the ground that the certified copies failed to show compliance with Tennessee law as set forth in Rounsaville v. Evatt, 733 SW2d 506 (Tenn. 1987), applying a stricter standard for the entry of a guilty plea than mandated by the U. S. Supreme Court in Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.

The U. S. Supreme Court held that the aggravating circumstance based on this conviction could not stand.</div><div class="casepar">The U. S. Supreme Court did not foreclose a harmless error analysis in a case where a conviction later set aside was used in aggravation of sentence. We note that in contrast to the situation in Johnson v. Mississippi, the evidence complained of here was not used to establish a statutory aggravating circumstance. More importantly at this point, the convictions complained of here have not been set aside, and it is not inevitable that they will be. See Housler v. State, 749 SW2d 758 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).

      The crime was committed November 24, 1984. Moon fled the state. He was returned to Georgia from Tennessee on September 3, 1987, and this case was tried January 11 through 21, 1988. A motion for new trial was filed on February 3, 1988, and denied March 30, 1988. The case was docketed in this court on April 18, 1988, and oral arguments were heard June 27, 1988.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      The 120-day period ended on Friday, January 1--a holiday. The first business day after January 1 was Monday, January 4. Moon concedes the 120-day limitation would not have been violated if the trial had begun on January 4. It did begin on January 11, exactly one week later.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      In contrast to Tennessee law, Georgia law defines rape as an offense that can be committed only against a female. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/6/1/index.html">16-6-1</a></span>. The offense characterized as an aggravated rape in Tennessee would amount to an aggravated sodomy here.
