While we find that, in several instances, portions of the trial court's charge to the jury improperly placed a burden of persuasion on Bridges, having reviewed the entirety of the court's charge, we are satisfied that Bridges' rights of due process were not prejudiced. We also find that any errors associated with the trial court's admission of certain hearsay testimony and prohibition against comment on the State's failure to call a witness were harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Bridge's guilt. Finding no other error associated with the adjudication of Bridges' guilt, we affirm.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to warrant a rational finder of fact to determine that Bridges, Chambless and McClendon were riding in a car driven by Vaughn. The car circled several times past a dice game being played outside an apartment. Bridges, Chambless and McClendon left the car; Chambless was carrying a .22 mm handgun, and Bridges obtained a .9 mm handgun from a friend in a nearby car. Several minutes after Bridges, Chambless and McClendon joined the crowd watching the dice game, Bridges drew a gun and ordered everyone present to lie on the ground. The game participants and bystanders complied, holding their money up for Chambless to collect. None of the victims resisted or provoked the robbers. As he was leaving the scene of the crime, Bridges fired a bullet into the back of Derico Cunningham, one of the dice players, as he lay face down on the ground. Bridges then stated, "I shot my man." Within hours, Cunningham died from the wound inflicted by Bridges. Another game participant was wounded by a gunshot fired by Chambless. The trio of criminals then ran to the waiting car and, with Vaughn behind the wheel, they drove off. A bystander followed them in his own truck, and contacted police by cellular phone while in pursuit. The criminals' car crashed and police arrested Chambless at the scene. Bridges and the others were apprehended shortly thereafter.</div><div class="casepar">At trial, Chambless and McClendon identified Bridges as the one who suggested the robbery, initiated the robbery, and shot and killed Cunningham. Vaughn also identified Bridges as a rider in his car and as one who went to and fled from the crime scene, along with Chambless and McClendon. Four robbery victims and a bystander identified Bridges as the one who shot and killed Cunningham; others nearby the scene of the crime identified Bridges as being at the crime scene. The witnesses' testimony identifying Bridges was consistent in all details, including the sequence of events surrounding the crime, the comments and threats Bridges made during the crime, and the clothing worn by Bridges at the crime scene. At trial, Bridges asserted an alibi defense, and testified that he was at his own home at the time the crimes were committed.</div><div class="casepar">1. The evidence introduced at trial, construed most favorably to the verdict, was sufficient to authorize a rational trier of fact to find Bridges guilty of the crimes of which he was convicted. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">2. Bridges raises sixteen enumerations of error concerning the trial court's charges to the jury. In considering these enumerations within the context of the entire charge as a whole and the trial record, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> we find that general charges were given to the jury regarding the State's burden to prove every material allegation of the indictment against Bridges beyond a reasonable doubt, and that Bridges carried no burden of proof whatsoever to disprove any part of the allegations against him. Our review of these general charges shows them to have been altogether accurate, and Bridges does not contend otherwise.</div><div class="casepar">Regarding the charges given to the jury regarding each crime charged against Bridges, we find that:</div><div class="casepar">(a) The trial court correctly charged the jury that if it found that Bridges had committed malice murder, as alleged in count one of the indictment, beyond a reasonable doubt, then it would be authorized to convict him of that crime. The trial court also correctly charged that if the jury did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges had committed malice murder, as alleged in count one, then it was required to acquit him of that charge. These charges were accurate, and Bridges does not contend otherwise.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Regarding counts two, three and four of the indictment, for the felony murder, armed robbery, and aggravated assault of Cunningham, the trial court correctly charged the jury that if it found that Bridges had committed those offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, then it would be authorized to convict. However, regarding each of these counts, the trial court also charged the jury that:</div><div class="casepar">If after a consideration of the evidence, you should find that the defendant did not commit [these offenses] beyond a reasonable doubt, then you would be authorized to acquit the defendant. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Thus, while the trial court's charges on these three counts were correct regarding the findings required for a conviction, the trial court's charge to the jury erroneously instructed that, in order to acquit, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges did not commit the offenses. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> It is axiomatic that no burden is ever placed on a criminal defendant to establish innocence, and "charges which place any burden of persuasion upon the defendant in criminal cases shall not be given, and such charges will be deemed erroneous and subject to reversal, absent harmless [or] invited error." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> Because this error directly implicated Bridges' due process right to compel the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crimes with which he was charged, it is of constitutional dimension. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span></div><div class="casepar">However, it does not follow that reversal is required. First, as stated above, erroneous jury instructions are not judged in isolation, but rather are considered in the context of the entire jury charge and the trial record as a whole to determine " 'whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.' " <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Second, an erroneous jury charge is not reversible unless it causes harm. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Applying these principles to this case, we cannot say that, under the circumstances of this case, there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the incorrect charges so as to permit convictions for felony murder, armed robbery, and aggravated assault without compelling the State to prove every element of those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court charged the jury correctly that before it could convict, it first had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges committed those crimes -- an instruction that was reiterated several times during the trial court's general charges that the State bore the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of the crimes charged. Of course, as discussed, the trial court also incorrectly charged that the jury had to acquit if it found that Bridges did not commit the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Looking at the entire charge as a whole, especially the general charges regarding the State's burden of persuasion before a conviction could be rendered, we cannot say that there is a reasonable likelihood that the incorrect charges regarding when the jury must acquit negated the correct charges regarding what findings had to be made before a conviction could be rendered. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Under the trial court's instructions, the jury simply could not convict on anything less than a reasonable doubt standard. Accordingly, while we find the jury charges discussed above to have been erroneous, they did not create a reasonable likelihood that Bridges could have been convicted under a constitutionally deficient standard, and thus they were harmless.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Similarly, regarding counts five, seven, eight and nine (representing three armed robbery counts and one count of aggravated assault), the trial court correctly charged that the jury could not convict unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges committed the offenses, and incorrectly charged that the jury should acquit if it found that Bridges did not commit the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. As discussed above, having examined the charge as a whole, especially the general charges regarding the State's burden of proof before a conviction could be rendered, we cannot say that there is a reasonable likelihood that the incorrect charges regarding when the jury must acquit negated the correct charges regarding what findings had to be made before a conviction could be rendered. Under the trial court's charge, the jury simply could not convict on these four counts unless and until it determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges was guilty. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> Thus, Bridges' enumerations concerning these charges are rejected.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Having reviewed the trial court's charges on counts six (for armed robbery), and ten and eleven (for aggravated assault with the intent to rob), we determine that the trial court correctly charged that the jury could not convict unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges committed the offenses, and correctly charged that if it found that Bridges did not commit the offenses (or, as was charged with regard to count six, if the jury had reasonable doubts about whether he committed armed robbery), it was required to acquit. Thus, we reject Bridges' enumerations regarding those charges.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Having reviewed the charge as a whole, we reject Bridges' contention that the trial court's charge on accomplice testimony improperly suggested that the State's witnesses and Bridges were accomplices, and thus constituted an expression of opinion by the court as to Bridges' guilt. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> Contrary to Bridges' contention, the trial court did not impermissibly shift the burden of persuasion to him by presuming in its charge that the State's witnesses were involved in committing the crimes with which Bridges was charged. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Similarly, we find that the trial court's charge, taken as a whole, required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges was a party to the crime, and we reject Bridges' contrary argument. We also find that, with regard to Bridges' alibi defense, the trial court correctly charged that the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Bridges was present at the scene of the crime, and therefore we reject Bridges' contention that the trial court's charge impermissibly placed the burden on him to prove his alibi. Finally, having reviewed the transcript, we conclude that in making its charge, the trial court did not improperly comment to the jury regarding its opinion of Bridges' alibi defense by instructing that "an alibi which still leaves it possible for the accused to be guilty is no alibi at all," and we reject as meritless Bridges' contention that the Court's charge on alibi was confusing.</div><div class="casepar">(f) The trial court charged the jury that:</div><div class="casepar">A person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act . . . and if a person uses a deadly weapon or instrumentality in the manner in which such weapon or instrumentality is ordinarily employed to produce death of a human being, the law presumes the intent to kill. This presumption may be rebutted, and if the State proves that the defendant [committed murder as charged] by use of a deadly weapon in a manner likely to produce death, then the killing is presumed to be intentional and malicious, unless as stated, in circumstances of alleviation, excuse or justification appear from [sic] your satisfaction from the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">As held by the United States Supreme Court in Sandstrom v. Montana, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> and reiterated in later cases, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> this charge was erroneous because it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on a material element of a crime charged against Bridges. As a material element of malice murder, the intent to kill must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the State. In its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that two mandatory presumptions exist with regard to the intent element. First, the jury was told that the intent to kill is presumed when one uses a deadly weapon in a manner ordinarily employed to cause death. Second, the jury was instructed that intent and malice were presumed if the State proved that the defendant used a deadly weapon in a manner likely to result in death. Although the trial court mentioned that the first presumption was rebuttable, the mandate to apply the presumption was left in place, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span> and reiterated by the trial court's instruction on the second presumption. "So long as the jury could infer that [Bridges] was required to produce more than 'some' evidence in order to rebut the [intent] presumption, the instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> Thus, as conceded by the State, these portions of the jury charge were erroneous.</div><div class="casepar">However, an impermissible Sandstrom instruction is harmless so long as the instruction was applied to an element of the crime that was not at issue in the trial, and if the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span> As discussed above, Bridges' defense at trial was non-involvement in the crime -- he claimed an alibi precluded any possibility he participated in the robbery and murder. Although his defense made no concession regarding intent or malice, it also made no claim of a lack of mens rea. While the burden of proof on those essential elements remained on the State, Bridges did not contest them or raise them as alternative defenses, and they were not placed in issue at trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source19" href="#note19">19</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Furthermore, the evidence of Bridges' guilt was overwhelming, as it included the testimony of numerous eyewitnesses, all of which was consistent in every detail. Finally, the evidence was overwhelming that the murder of Cunningham was done with intent and malice <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span> -- he offered no resistance to the robbery, but rather complied with the robbers' demands and immediately relinquished his money, and was shot in the back as he lay prostrate on the ground, with his murderer later gloating about the killing. Accordingly, we determine that the Sandstrom error in this case was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">3. A police officer testified on behalf of the State that after the crimes occurred, he spoke with Michael Tidwell, who claimed that he knew the first names of those persons involved. The police officer also testified that based upon his conversation with Tidwell, he knew the first names of Bridges, Chambless and McClendon. Tidwell did not, however, testify at trial and the trial court granted the State's motion in limine prohibiting defense counsel from commenting during closing arguments on the State's failure to call Tidwell as a witness.</div><div class="casepar">In Morgan v. State, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span> which applies to this appeal, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source22" href="#note22">22</a></span> this Court ruled that defense counsel may comment upon the State's failure to present certain witnesses, so long as there is competent evidence before the jury that the missing witness has knowledge of material and relevant facts. Because the police officer's testimony in this case was properly before the jury, and related that while investigating the crimes, the officer obtained information from Tidwell indicating that Bridges was one of the perpetrators, the trial court erred by prohibiting Bridges from commenting on the State's failure to produce Tidwell as a witness.</div><div class="casepar">We conclude, however, that the error is not reversible because it is highly improbable that it contributed to the jury's verdict. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source23" href="#note23">23</a></span> Even if the trial court had permitted Bridges to comment on the State's failure to call Tidwell, that single comment and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom would not have been exculpatory in light of the overwhelming evidence of Bridges' guilt, which included numerous eyewitness identifications, all of which were consistent. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source24" href="#note24">24</a></span></div><div class="casepar">4. Bridges was not prohibited from questioning witnesses about pending criminal charges against them, and there was no error in the trial court's grant of the State's motion in limine regarding such questioning, which merely required defense counsel to employ proper procedures in such questioning.</div><div class="casepar">5. Having reviewed the array of photographs used in the photographic lineup that resulted in several witnesses identifying Bridges as having been involved in the crimes, we determine that the array was not so impermissibly suggestive as to cause a substantial likelihood of misidentification, and thus the trial court did not err in denying Bridges' motion to suppress his pre-trial identification. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span></div><div class="casepar">6. Any error associated with the trial court's admission of hearsay statements made by Tidwell to police investigators was harmless in light of the fact that the statements were cumulative of other evidence that was properly admitted. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source26" href="#note26">26</a></span> The admission of hearsay statements made by Bridges' father to police investigators was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Bridges' guilt. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source27" href="#note27">27</a></span></div><div class="casepar">7. After a witness, in a comment unresponsive to a question, stated that he knew Bridges while both were held in juvenile detention, the trial court gave curative instructions to the jury, directing that it should disregard the comment. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Bridges' renewed mistrial motion. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source28" href="#note28">28</a></span></div><div class="casepar">8. Finally, Bridges claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, based upon purported instances of deficient representation, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source29" href="#note29">29</a></span> and that the trial court erred in denying his new trial motion.

Additionally, in Division 2 (f) the majority acknowledges a Sandstrom violation, which, like the other seven erroneous charges, also shifts the burden of proof on the material element of intent. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source37" href="#note37">37</a></span> Without being a mind reader, l see no logical or legal way to conclude that these egregious errors on the fundamental element of the state's burden of proof are harmless, and, therefore, I would reverse.</div><div class="casepar">Another concern in this case is the mere fact of 11 errors of a substantial nature.

      The crimes occurred on September 20, 1993. On February 15, 1994, Bridges was indicted for (a) the malice murder, felony murder, armed robbery and aggravated assault of Cunningham; (b) the armed robbery of Anthony and Kenneth Wright, Tomes and Johnson; (c) the aggravated assault of Wright; (d) the aggravated assault with the intent to rob of Thompson and Bruester. The trial was held on July 12-18, 1994, and Bridges was found guilty on all counts. By order filed on July 27, 1994, he was sentenced to (a) life imprisonment for Cunningham's murder; (b) life imprisonment for the armed robbery counts, to run consecutively to the first sentence; and (c) twenty years each for the aggravated assault counts, to run consecutively to the other sentences. Bridges' new trial motion was filed on August 3, 1994, amended on December 11, 1996, and denied on January 28, 1997. The court reporter certified the transcript of the trial on December 5, 1994. Bridges' notice of appeal was filed on February 26, 1997. The appeal was docketed on March 11, 1997, and it was submitted for decision without oral argument on May 5, 1997.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;

At the motion for new trial hearing, defense counsel testified that (1) he did not ask about the pending charges for strategic reasons; (2) he did not object to the motion in limine because it did not hamper his ability to question witnesses about pending charges; (3) he did adequately cross-examine witnesses about deals made in exchange for their testimony; and (4) he did not believe that any testimony commented on Bridges' right to remain silent.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note30" href="#source30">30</a></span>&nbsp;
