The plaintiff further prayed for damages in the sum of $25,000 for injury and damage sustained; for a rule nisi, and "such other and further relief as may be equitable and just."</div><div class="casepar">On February 13, 1962, the trial judge issued an ex parte restraining order and an order nisi setting a hearing for the temporary restraining order on February 26, 1962. The matter came on for hearing with no answer or defensive pleading filed. The plaintiff introduced evidence in support of his petition, and rested; whereupon, the defendants moved orally for a dissolution of the ex parte restraining order and a denial of the interlocutory injunction. On the same day, the trial judge issued an order dissolving and vacating the ex parte restraining order and denying the prayers for an interlocutory injunction.</div><div class="casepar">The case comes to this court on a bill of exceptions assigning error on the order of the trial judge denying the temporary relief sought.</div><div class="casepar">The following evidence was adduced from testimony given solely by witnesses called by the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff owns a one-fourth portion of the land in question, bounded on the south and east by lands owned by the defendant Empire. The defendants had graded and filled their property so that the surface water there drained into ditches and flowed principally into three large sum holes which are joined by a system of interconnecting 54-inch drainage pipes. This drainage system was so designed that the flow was directed from the sums down a 54-inch drainage pipe which, at a point some 20 feet above the natural drainage level, fed the waters into a flume or chute which in turn led into a stream fed by a spring which meandered through the defendants' and the plaintiff's lands. The stream was a natural drain for the lands.</div><div class="casepar">There was some discrepancy in the testimony as to how far the toe of the flume was from the land of the plaintiff. There was material conflict as to whether the flume fed into the old stream, the plaintiff testifying that it was some 15 or 16 feet south of the old bed, while an engineer testified it did reach the stream bed but at an angle. There was testimony to the effect that as a result there was some spillage and overflow at the junction of the flume and the stream. The plaintiff testified that this made his land muddy and marshy, but not to what extent or how he was damaged. He also testified that mud was dumped on his land by the stream resultant from the grading operations, although he conceded that a portion of that residue or silt was due to drainage from other lands adjoining his on the north and west, and did not show that the damage was continuing.</div><div class="casepar">There was evidence that the stream itself was formerly clear, suitable for drinking, while subsequently to the defendants' operations it had become muddy. However, the plaintiff stated that he did not intend to use the stream for drinking purposes. There was testimony by an engineer that the grading of the defendants' property had increased the drainage area which flowed into the stream, but he later admitted that there might be little or no increase at all.</div><div class="casepar">There was testimony that the concentration of water due to the sums, coupled with the flow through the pipes as opposed to the natural flow over earth, would lead to increased velocity and volume at the point where the water reached the plaintiff's land. No showing was made as to whether this would cause the stream to overflow its banks except during a flash flood under very rare circumstances. There was no positive showing as to the extent or continuance of damages. The plaintiff merely said: "I'm getting more than I used to get."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff testified that the defendants graded a ridge which formerly prevented some of the water from flowing down on his lands, but on cross-examination neither he nor the engineer could reconcile this with a map showing contour lines. The plaintiff further complained about a loose fill that made his land "swampy." This testimony was corroborated by the before-mentioned engineer who said that there was some seepage out of the base of the fill, but he further stated that this would be alleviated as the defendants made further improvements (paving and sodding) and could be corrected by building a French drain.</div><div class="casepar">The testimony of one of the officers of Empire and Central, called for the purpose of cross-examination, was that Empire was a totally owned subsidiary of Central; that Central engineers worked on the project and in effect that Central and Empire worked together to plan the area; that the plaintiff knew of the industrial purposes for which the defendants acquired their land's and likewise acquired his land for industrial or business purposes. There was evidence that the plaintiff paid $23,000 for the land in question and $30,000 for land reaching to the expressway. He had recovered $26,000 through awards from condemnation by the State Highway Department for right of way purposes.</div><div class="casepar"> No precept is more firmly established in our law than that this court will not disturb or control the trial judge's discretion in either denying or granting an interlocutory injunction, in the absence of legal abuse of such discretion. Cubbedge &amp; Hazlehurst v. Adams, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. 124</span>; Cherokee Iron Co. v. Jones, <span class="casemissing">52 Ga. 276</span>; Loadman v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../186/90/index.html">210 Ga. 520 (81 SE2d 465)</a></span>; Dozier v. Mangham, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/51/index.html">215 Ga. 718 (113 SE2d 212)</a></span>. This is true where there is any conflict as to material issues of the case. Jones v. Johnson, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. 260</span>; Roughton v. Thiele Kaolin Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/94/index.html">211 Ga. 15 (83 SE2d 590)</a></span>; Hutchins v. Williams, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/49/index.html">212 Ga. 754 (95 SE2d 674)</a></span>. The reasons for this rule are succinctly and pointedly brought out in the case of Kirtland v. Mayor &amp;c. of Macon, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. 747</span>, 750, where Justice Bleckley stated: "Injunction ad interim is a part of equity police. It is a device to keep the parties in order to prevent one from hurting the other whilst their respective rights are under adjudication. There is often a cry for police when there is no real danger. The equity of a bill is not lost because an injunction is denied, or because it is not applied for before the final hearing." (Emphasis supplied).</div><div class="casepar">Equity intervenes by grant of an interlocutory injunction to prevent irreparable damage to one of the parties and to maintain the status quo until a final determination is made. Mobley v. Brundage, <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 829 (154 SE 452)</span>; City of Elberton v. Hobbs, <span class="casemissing">121 Ga. 749 (49 SE 779)</span>; Edwards v. United Food Brokers Inc., <span class="casemissing">195 Ga. 1</span>, 8 (<span class="casemissing">22 SE2d 812</span>); First Fed. Savings &amp;c. Assn. v. Owen, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../186/61/index.html">210 Ga. 424 (80 SE2d 169)</a></span>. In short, there must be some vital necessity for the injunction so that one of the parties will not be damaged and left without adequate remedy.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, the plaintiff attempted to introduce evidence to support his contentions that the actions of the defendants materially contributed to the pollution of the stream, to the seepage of water and the depositing of mud upon his lands, and that water from the flume hitting at a point outside the old stream bed caused water to flow unnaturally over his land, causing swampy conditions, erosion and washing, all to the great hurt and damage of the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">To some degree, the plaintiff proved his case as laid without conflict. However, there was material conflict as to the quantum of damages, as well as the continuance, or certainty of the continuing nature, of the damages during the interim period from the hearing until the time of the final disposition of the case. The testimony of the witnesses was not at all conclusive as to the manner, extent or certainty of damage to the plaintiff's property, nor that such damage would be irreparable. Most important, the evidence did not disclose that an injunction would be necessary to protect the plaintiff's interests during the pendency of the suit.</div><div class="casepar">Upon a careful review of the record here before us, whatever may be the rights of the respective parties on a trial of the case, we can not say the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the interlocutory injunction.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Robert Smalley, John B.
