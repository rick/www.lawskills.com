He demanded that the $10,000 in the escrow fund be returned to him; and that he be awarded expenses of $872.20, punitive damages, and attorney fees.</div><div class="casepar">In the printed portion of the contract of sale it was provided that the seller warranted that lie had title to the property; that the seller agreed to convey good and marketable title by warranty deed, subject to four items, one of these being: "Zoning ordinances affecting said property . . ." At the conclusion of the contract certain typed "special stipulations" were listed, and it was stated that these stipulations would control, if conflicting with printed matter, and that the ninth stipulation was as follows: "Seller warrants this property is zoned for Garden Apartments."</div><div class="casepar">The purchaser (appellee) filed a motion for summary judgment. The accompanying affidavits recited in material part the facts which follow. At the time the contract of sale was signed in the office of a real estate broker one of the sellers affirmed to all present that the property was zoned for apartments. A special stipulation was placed in the contract based on this affirmation, and it was the understanding of the purchaser, and of other affiants who were present, that the zoning situation was a condition precedent to the closing on the sale. On the date for the closing the purchaser was informed by the engineering firm employed by him that the property was not entirely zoned for apartments. The purchaser then considered that he was not bound by the contract and refused to consummate it. After the closing date for the sale, the sellers petitioned the zoning authorities of Marietta for a rezoning of the portion of the property which was zoned residential but this petition was denied.</div><div class="casepar">The sellers (appellants) filed their motion in opposition to the grant of summary judgment to the purchaser, and also for summary judgment in their own behalf. In the affidavit of one of the sellers, accompanying the motion, he stated that he did not realize that the entire tract was not zoned for apartments until he was informed of this fact by the purchaser on the date set for closing the sale.</div><div class="casepar">The purchaser thereafter amended his counterclaim to allege that the representation of the sellers in the contract of sale that they warranted the property was zoned for apartments was founded on mistake, and demanded that the contract be rescinded because of this mistake.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge denied the sellers' motion for summary judgment and granted the purchaser's motion for summary judgment. He ordered that the escrow fund be paid to the purchaser, and that the other demands of the purchaser for unliquidated damages be reserved for determination by a jury.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal is from these rulings, upon certificate for immediate review.</div><div class="casepar">The primary question for determination here is whether the nonperformance of the aforesaid special stipulation, that the sellers warrant that the property is zoned for apartments, authorized a rescission of the contract by the purchaser.</div><div class="casepar">Code  20-109 provides: "A contract may be absolute or conditional. In the former, every covenant is independent, and the breach of one does not relieve the obligation of another. In the latter, the covenants are dependent the one upon the other, and the breach of one is a release of the binding force of all dependent covenants. The classification of every contract must depend upon, a rational interpretation of the intention of the parties."</div><div class="casepar">Code  20-907 provides: "In some cases a party may rescind, without the consent of the opposite party, for nonperformance by him of his covenants; but this can be done only when both parties can be restored to the condition in which they were before the contract was made."</div><div class="casepar">In Fletcher v. Fletcher, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 899 (124 SE 722)</span>, it was said: "The right of one party to rescind a contract, for nonperformance by the other party of his obligations thereunder is not confined to covenants in their strict legal sense, but extends to agreements other than such covenants . . ."</div><div class="casepar">Both the sellers and the purchaser would be presumed to know the zoning regulations of the City of Marietta. Maloof v. Gwinnett County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../124/15/index.html">231 Ga. 164 (200 SE2d 749)</a></span>. However, when the sellers by a special stipulation in the contract warranted that the property was zoned for apartments, this was, in effect, a covenant that the property was already zoned for apartments, or would be thus zoned at the time for closing the sale.</div><div class="casepar">The sellers contend that rescission of the contract was not available to the purchaser because Code  20-1412 provides a remedy by damages for a breach of warranty of title. They further contend that the purchaser did not comply with the contract by giving written notice to the sellers.</div><div class="casepar">The stipulation here in regard to the zoning status of the property did not concern title, and Code  20-1412 has no applicability to the case. The provision of the contract requiring written notice as to any defect in title would not require written notice as to the nonperformance of a condition of the contract having no relation to title.</div><div class="casepar">There is no dispute in the evidence that all parties entered into the contract under the mistaken belief that the property was zoned for apartments. The stipulation warranting that the property was zoned for apartments was a material covenant of the contract, since the purchaser intended to build apartments on the property.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs agreed to sell the defendant land zoned for garden apartments. He failed to do so. A portion of the property was zoned for residential use.</div><div class="casepar">The purchaser does not seek to rescind an absolute conveyance, but an unconsummated contract of sale. Under the contract and the evidence submitted as to the intention of the parties, the non performance of the special stipulation by the sellers authorized a rescission of the contract by the purchaser. There were no issues of fact to be submitted to a jury except those reserved in the judgment of the trial judge.</div><div class="casepar">The appellants contend that the appellee filed no response to their motion for summary judgment, and that they are therefore entitled as a matter of law to the grant of their motion for summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">The appellee's supporting affidavits filed with his motion for summary judgment were before the trial judge. The appellants' motion for summary judgment raised no new issue of fact which required an additional response by the appellee.</div><div class="casepar">We find no error in the rulings complained of in this appeal.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">McDonald &amp; Dupree, Hylton B.
