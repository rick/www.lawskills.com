December 5, 1949.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The evidence sustains the verdict and the special grounds assigning error on the ruling of the court with reference to the argument of the solicitor-general are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant was convicted of public drunkenness. He filed his motion for a new trial on the usual general grounds and thereafter added three special grounds. The motion was overruled and the defendant assigns error here on this judgment. Briefly, the officers testified that they saw the defendant at about 10 o'clock at a night club inside the city limits of Tallapoosa, Georgia, in a drunken condition caused by the excessive use of intoxicating liquors, which drunkenness was "made manifest by boisterousness and by indecent condition and acting and by vulgar, profane and unbecoming language, and by the loud and violent discourse of the said accused." Two officers went to the club. The defendant was in the kitchen. He motioned to Officer McCain to come to him. The officer walked to the. defendant. The defendant wanted the officer to go out in the back, and the officer went with him. The defendant then stated to the officer that he was going to sell whisky when he moved over to the other place and any "damn" thing else he wanted to, at the new place. The officer remarked to the defendant that it would be best for the defendant to go home and sleep it off. Whereupon the defendant replied that he was not ready to go home and that he would tell the officer something else--that when the defendant got to the new place no "damn" police was to come into the new place; that he, the defendant, Could have Officer McCain killed for $50; that he could have him lying in the undertaking establishment within an hour for $50. About that time the other officer, Walker, called to McCain. The defendant was staggering. He was cursing. McCain smelled whisky on the defendant's breath. There had been no previous trouble between Officer McCain and the defendant. The officers were on duty at the time. They were driving in a police car. The officers left the club of the defendant and went back to town. Officer Walker did not have any conversation with the defendant at the club. As, the officers were driving through town a car came from behind the officers and the lights were dimmed and the horn was blown. The officers stopped the car in which they were riding to make an investigation as to who it was behind them. Officer Walker got out and went to the car which had been driven up behind the police car. Officer McCain remained in the police car. The parties in the car behind the police car began talking loudly and cursing. At this point McCain got out of the police car and went towards the other car and found that Officer Walker had hold of the defendant. Officer McCain took hold of the defendant also. About that time one Key pulled McCain loose from the defendant, whereupon the defendant hit Walker and knocked the officer down and kicked him in the side. McCain pulled Key away from Officer Walker and took hold of the defendant. About this time Walker struck the defendant with a blackjack. Key remarked that the officers were not going to carry the defendant to jail. The officers had the defendant under arrest. The officers stated that they were going to</div><div class="casepar">take the defendant to jail, and they did so. Key got in the car and drove away. The defendant and Key were in a car which the defendant had been driving. The defendant said that there wasn't any four ---- ---- ---- ---- going to lock him up, much less two of them.</div><div class="casepar">Officer Walker testified in substance as to the conduct of the defendant when the defendant and Key overtook the officers' car and stopped the officers, stating that the defendant knocked him down, breaking three of the officer's ribs and in addition finally stated that the defendant, after the scuffle, told Walker that he would go with Walker to jail, and ordered Key to get in the car and drive away, which Key did.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant introduced evidence tending to show that Officer McCain was under the influence of liquor, and in other respects denying the evidence of the officers. The defendant made his statement substantiating the evidence of his witnesses. While. in some respects the testimony was conflicting, the jury resolved the whole evidence against the defendant in returning the verdict of guilty.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict. Indeed, counsel for the defendant did not argue the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">2. The three special grounds are similar in nature and are directed to the remarks of the solicitor-general during the argument of the case before a jury. The complaint in the first ground is that the solicitor-general in his argument stated: "Even if the police did take a drink of liquor, that didn't excuse the defendant for being an outlaw." At this point counsel for the defendant objected to the argument of the solicitor-general and moved for a mistrial. The Court thereupon stated: "Gentlemen, counsel have a right to argue the evidence and the defendant's statement and to draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence and the statement of the defendant. If counsel should get out of that, go beyond that, of course you will not pay any attention to the argument. You are supposed to remember the evidence and remember the defendant's statement, and then counsel in their deductions from that evidence in their argument. I don't think the statement would justify me in declaring a mistrial. I have confidence in the jury's intelligence, unpartiality, and fairness, and I overrule the motion for mistrial." Counsel assigns error on the court's overruling the motion for a mistrial on the ground that it was improper and prejudicial argument on behalf of the solicitor-general and that such argument was an unlawful attack upon the defendant's character, and that the use of the word "outlaw" in such argument was degrading and inflammable. After this ruling, the solicitor-general in effect repeated his argument as set forth in special ground 1 and similar objections were made by counsel for the defendant, which appear in special ground 1, and the court made substantially the same ruling and the defendant's attorney made substantially the same assignments of error.</div><div class="casepar">In special ground 3 the solicitor-general stated: "When a man is approached by the officers of the law, and is informed by them that he is under an arrest, and he recognizes them as officers and know they have authority to arrest him as the defendant did in this case, but instead of submitting to the arrest as he should have in the first instance and he resisted the arrest, how much more do you want on which to build an outlaw?" Whereupon counsel for the defendant made approximately the same objection as specified in special ground 1 and the court made approximately the same ruling. We have studied these special grounds carefully and find no reversible error in them, in view of the court's statement,--indeed, if the law required any statement from the court in view of this argument under the evidence other than to overrule the motion for a mistrial. The remarks of the solicitor-general in no way attack the character of the defendant outside of the evidence. It appears that the solicitor-general confined his argument to deductions and inferences from the evidence and did not lug in extraneous matters other than appears from the evidence. There are many decisions to the effect that the assignments of error in the three special grounds show no cause for reversal. See, in this connection, Smith v. State, <span class="casemissing">74 Ga. App. 777</span> (41 S. E. 2d, 541), and cases cited therein.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Hal C.
