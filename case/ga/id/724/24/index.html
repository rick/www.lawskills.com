J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Where, under the direction of the judge of a city court, an attorney is employed to prepare the insolvent cost lists of the clerk, sheriff, and solicitor of such court, under an agreement, concurred in and complied with by the clerk and the sheriff, and acquiesced in by the solicitor, that the attorney will be paid for his services, an action by such attorney against such solicitor to recover the reasonable value of his services to the solicitor is an action upon a quantum meruit of which the superior court of the county has jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff, Alec Harris, filed suit in the Superior Court of Floyd County against Vaughn Terrell for $500 making substantially the following allegations: Terrell was Solicitor of the City Court of Floyd County from January 1, 1945 to the date of the filing of the present suit; it is the duty of the solicitor of the city court to file an itemized statement of the insolvent costs at the end of the term of said court and to make a settlement with the treasurer of the county at the end of each fall term of the court; it is the duty of the sheriff and the clerk of the city court to file an itemized and detailed statement of the insolvent costs at the end of each term of the court; the court convenes in March, June, September, and December of each year; J. L. Jolly was the clerk and M. E. Horton was the sheriff of the court at the time of the filing of the suit and had been prior to January 1, 1945; prior to October 1, 1947, neither Terrell, Jolly, nor Horton, had filed proper and approved itemized lists of insolvent costs due each of them for the years 1945, 1946, and up to October 1, 1947; after the last named date, Judge J. T. Kelly of the city court called Jolly, Horton, and the defendant Terrell before him and directed them to file an itemized and detailed statement of all insolvent costs collected and held by them jointly and severally from January 1, 1945 to November 22, 1947; thereupon the defendant, Terrell, and Jolly and Horton, jointly and severally agreed that Judge Kelly might appoint the plaintiff, Alec Harris, to audit the accounts of the defendant, Terrell, solicitor of the court, and of Jolly and Horton, as regards all fines, forfeitures, and automobile condemnations imposed and collected and as to all insolvent costs earned by and due to them; the plaintiff was notified by Judge Kelly that he had been selected by the defendant Terrell, Jolly, and Horton, to audit the financial accounts of the criminal branch of the city court from January 1, 1945 to November 22, 1947; and after the plaintiff received the notification, he took charge of all of the accusations, nisi and absolute resulting from bond forfeiture, and automobile condemnations arising in the court, and made an itemized and detailed statement thereof and filed it in the city court the latter part of November, 1947; at the time the plaintiff was selected to make the audit, it was agreed that the defendant Terrell, Jolly and Horton were to pay the plaintiff for his services in auditing the accounts; the plaintiff complied wish the duties and tasks imposed by the agreement and appointment and made a charge of $500 against each of the officers; Jolly and Horton settled with the plaintiff, but the defendant failed and refused to pay the plaintiff his part of the plaintiff's charge. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence, counsel for the defendant made a motion that the court dismiss the petition on the ground that the superior court had no jurisdiction, but that the city court had exclusive jurisdiction to fix the fee, as the judge of the city court had appointed the plaintiff as auditor. The court thereupon entered the following order: "Upon motion of the defendant that the Judge of the City Court has exclusive jurisdiction to fix the fee of the auditor, the within case is hereby dismissed." To this judgment the plaintiff excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> So far as this record reveals, no demurrer was filed to the petition other than the oral motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in the superior court. The plaintiff testified in part: "I am a practicing attorney admitted to practice in the State of Georgia and having an office here in Rome . . . This is my fifty-first year that I have been practicing law. I was solicitor of the City Court of Floyd County for four years. For over two year I was assistant solicitor-general. During those periods of time I made up what is known as insolvent court cost lists of officers of the court. Therefore, I am familiar with the manner and way it is done. As far as I know (outside [of] some attorney who has been solicitor of our courts) any attorney who knows how to make up insolvent court cost lists would have to study it out; have experience. That was known to Judge Kelly, the Judge of the City Court . . . Sometimes on or about the first of October 1947, I was requested to come to the office of Judge Kelly in the County Court House. Judge Kelly was Judge of the City Court at that time, and he is at the present time . . . I went up and talked to Judge Kelly. I don't think Mr. Terrell was present at any time I was talking to Judge Kelly. Afterwards I had conversations with Mr. Terrell in connection with this matter, fifty or seventy-five times. When I talked with Judge Kelly, Judge Kelly told me it had been agreed upon for me to make an audit the first of January 1946, or 1945, whichever it was, to November 22, 1947. I think it was two and three-quarter years. An audit of all insolvent costs and all costs with reference to the city court, including sheriff's, judge's and bailiff's fines, forfeitures, and fees. In other words, all fines in hands of officers of the court. Judge Kelly had approached me three or four times in regard to the matter. I declined to have anything to do with it. When he called me to the courthouse I came and this took place. Following my conversation with Judge Kelly I saw Mr. Terrell. As a matter of fact, at that time my office was in the building of the Fifth Avenue Drug Store, and Mr. Terrell's office was in the back end of the building, approximately forty to fifty feet from my office. Following this conversation with Judge Kelly, I immediately got hold of all the accusations in the clerk's office and put them in a big box, about eighteen inches square. They filled the box. I took them to the office and then consulted Mr. Terrell and got what he had in his office at that time. Then I spent around thirty days and parts of nights working on it. I would consult Mr. Terrell practically every day on various items of this insolvent cost. Under the law the solicitor is responsible for all fines paid and of the manner they are due to be paid to the solicitor. Then he has to account for them after paying all</div><div class="casepar">officer's costs. It was necessary, in determining these amounts (what had been paid and what had not been paid, as you said) to talk with Mr. Terrell in reference to it. I talked to him fifty or seventy-five times, I imagine. Mr. Terrell knew at all times what I was doing and he did not hesitate to cooperate with me all the way through. When I had the first conversation with him I did not tell him about the conversation with Judge Kelly, but he knew about it. During all the conversations he never once said he did not agree to it or objected to me. He co-operated with me and never refused to give information I asked for. I talked to him frequently, fifty or seventy-five times. In checking maybe I would find an accusation missing. He would have it in his office. Maybe the cost was not right; he would have the record. Maybe I would find some paid and some not paid; he would correct it. He would also tell me how much money he had on hand not turned over. It was not the law but he agreed on it; money was paid into the hands of the clerk and the clerk made the distribution of cash and money to various officers. I think that kept up until about the first of August, 1947. Mr. Terrell then took charge of the fines after that. The clerk took no more fines or costs. I had to go to Mr. Terrell to see if various parties paid money, how much, and if it was paid to him. He would always tell me how much and so forth. As far as fines, forfeitures, and condemnation of automobiles, I also discussed with Mr. Terrell; especially anything I could not tell about. I did not go from item to item. That would have taken months . . . I did know how many cases I actually had to check as to cost allowable, but I have forgotten the approximate [exact?] number. It ran through 1945 or 1946 and most of 1947. It ran 450 or 500 cases a year, I think, but I am not positive. I think it was 1300 or 1400 cases . . . Every one was turned over to me. Judge Kelly wanted a report by the twenty-second of November 1947. Wanted it then by all means. I got all the accusations I could find in the clerk's office and took all Mr. Terrell turned over to me; I did not check the docket with each accusation because the number on the accusation was the same as the number on the docket because I would not have had time to make a report by the twenty-second of November. In getting the accusations and papers I asked Mr. Terrell to turn over all the papers he had, and I made the same request at the clerk's office and at the sheriff's office. All the way through he kept handing me another. Those things were scattered around in three offices. Some were never turned over to me at all. I worked about thirty days until ten or eleven at night and Sunday afternoons. I gave practically my entire time. I gave my entire time. On the report here is a letter to Judge Kelly dated November 5, 1947. That is the time I turned it over to Judge Kelly. On November 28, 1947, Judge Kelly entered an order on the audit. My recollection is that I was present at the time the audit was approved by Judge Kelly. I don't think Vaughn Terrell was right there then. Of course I can't tell what Judge Kelly said in the conversation but we had a conversation. I never talked to Vaughn Terrell about the report. Following the filing of the report Mr. Jolly and Mr. Horton paid me their prorata portion. It was $500 each. In my experience as an attorney and in my knowledge of matters of that kind, $1500 is a reasonable charge for that. I would not want to do it again for any price. I would not want to fool with it." It is readily conceded by counsel on both sides, and we think, correctly, that the plaintiff in this case was no such an auditor as is contemplated by Code  10-101 and 10-102; that is to say, in order to draw a distinction, he was not a "judicial auditor." It is obvious that he was not an arbitrator within the contemplation of the arbitration laws. Code,  7-101. There was, so far as the record shows, no disagreement as to rights and liabilities. From the foregoing evidence and the plaintiff's petition, it appears that the plaintiff's employment in auditing the insolvent cost lists was more in the nature of a "commercial audit." There was no case pending in which the necessity for a preliminary or tentative investigation would have authorized the appointment of a court, or judicial, auditor. It was the duty of the officers involved to submit these lists at regular intervals to the court for approval, this they had failed to do for a period of more than two years. Their failure to do so could have subjected them to a money rule by the court. Instead of ruling the officers, the court apparently chose to have them agree to have an experienced person prepare for them the insolvent costs for his approval. We think that the jury would have been au-</div><div class="casepar">thorized under these circumstances disclosed by the evidence, to infer that the officers including the present defendant agreed to this procedure and that an agreement to pay for the services rendered (although there may have been an absence of an express agreement) was implied. There was evidence of the request that the plaintiff perform the work, evidence of the specialized nature of the work, evidence of the time required to perform the task, evidence of the reasonable value of the services, and evidence of the defendant's knowledge of, acquiescence in, and co-operation in the project. The elements of an action upon an implied assumpsit, a quantum meruit, could have been found by the jury to be present in this case, and we think that clearly, under the pleadings and evidence, the suit was brought upon a quantum meruit and was in no wise an effort to collect an auditor's fee; that is a "judicial auditor's" fee, which would have been fixed by the city court. The superior court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties plaintiff and defendant, and consequently erred in dismissing the suit for lack of jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
