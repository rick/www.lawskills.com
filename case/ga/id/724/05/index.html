August 9, 1950.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The judge of the superior court has the power and authority to pass, on the court's own motion, an order directing the clerk of the court to attach to the plaintiff's petition a process as required under Code  81-201, and for which the plaintiff prayed, when it appears that the clerk had attached to the petition a process which required the defendants to be and appear at the February term 1950 of the court to answer the plaintiff's suit, as formerly provided by said, Code section, instead of as now provided under said statute that the defendants be and appear in said court in thirty days from service of the petition and answer the plaintiff's complaint.</div><div class="casepar">On December 23, 1949, Sara Beverly Hubbard, a minor, by O. M. Hubbard, as next friend, brought suit in Hart Superior Court against Mrs. A. E. Brown, and dock Banister, as executor of A, E. Brown, deceased, to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by her as a result of a collision by the automobile in which the plaintiff was riding and an automobile of the deceased, A. B. Brown, which was being driven at the time by Mrs. A. E. Brown, and which was an automobile owned and kept by the deceased for the comfort, pleasure, convenience and use of his family, of which the defendant, Mrs. A. F. Brown was a member, and that said automobile was being used as a family-purpose car at the time of the collision, in which the plaintiff was injured. The plaintiff set up that the said Mrs. Brown was operating this automobile at the time in a careless and negligent manner, and that as a result thereof she drove the same into the car in which the plaintiff was riding. The plaintiff prayed "that process issue requiring the defendants to be and appear and to file their answer to this complaint in this court as is now provided by law." Thereupon the clerk of said court attached to the petition a process requiring the defendants "to be and appear at the next superior court, to be holden in and for said county, on the fourth Monday in February, 1950, then and there to answer plaintiff's complaint," which process was dated December 23, 1949, bore teste in the name of the judge of said court and Was signed by a deputy clerk thereof and was directed to the Sheriff of Hart County or his legal deputies. The sheriff served each of the defendants personally, entering his return of service on December 24, 1949.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant, Dock Banister, as such executor, filed a general demurrer to the plaintiff's petition, on the ground that the process attached to the petition was "a null and void process, because not in conformity with Code  81-201 . . . which Code section requires that the clerk shall annex to every petition a process, unless the same shall be waived, signed by the Clerk or his deputy, bearing teste in the name of the judge of the court and directed to the sheriff of the county, or his deputy, requiring the defendant to answer the petition within thirty days after the service of the petition, and the process does not conform thereto because it requires the defendant to answer the said suit, and be and appear in court on the fourth Monday in February, and then and there answer same, and not within 30 days from date of service of the petition;" and "that the failure of the clerk or his deputy to attach to the petition a process required by said Code section renders said suit subject to demurrer, as being null and void, and same is a fatal defect, and cannot be cured by amendment, defendant never having waived same." The said defendant, Dock Banister, as such executor, also filed "his special plea in abatement" and set up that the suit be abated on the ground that the action was one in tort and did not survive the death of A. E. Brown, and his estate was not liable, and also because of the alleged void process, as set out in the general demurrer filed. Said defendant, Dock Banister, also filed a traverse to the entry of service on the petition on the ground that same was served with said void process and he has not been properly or legally served and he denies the truth thereof. Said defendant also filed his motion to quash said suit on the ground that the process attached Lo the petition was void as set out in said demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">On the hearing on August 9, 1950, the court rendered the following order, which appears to have been rendered by the court on its own motion.</div><div class="casepar">"TO THE HON. JOHN W. HERNDON, CLERK SUPERIOR COURT, HART COUNTY, GEORGIA:</div><div class="casepar">"Defendant Dock Banister, Executor of the will of A. E. Brown, deceased, in his demurrer and motion to quash, having directed the court's attention to the fact that the process attached to both the original and copy of suit in the above stated and captioned case, is not in conformity with law (Code  81-201, Ann. Code of Ga.):</div><div class="casepar">"This is to direct you to detach and delete what purports to be process attached to original petition and in lieu thereof attach process in conformity with above section both to original and all copies for service upon defendant and deliver same to sheriff for service upon defendants.</div><div class="casepar">"When this order and directive have been complied wish you will report same to the undersigned so that action and decision may be had upon said demurrer and motion to quash."</div><div class="casepar">To this order and judgment the defendants except.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. Did the superior court judge have the power and authority on his own motion to pass the order to which exception is made? Code  24-104(G) provides that a court of this State has the power "To amend and control its processes and orders, so as to make them conformable to law and justice; and to amend its own records, so as to make them conform to the truth." Code  24-104(4) provides that courts have the power "To control, in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its officers and all other persons connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter appertaining thereto." It has been held by the Supreme Court of Georgia that it is the duty of the judge, on his own motion, to interpose and give a case proper direction, where he sees injustice about to be done, and the case is in limine, and there is no estoppel available to either party. "It is the duty of the judge to protect the law from being outraged." It is the sworn obligation of the judge "to see that the law is administered." Kelly v. Strouse, <span class="casemissing">116 Ga. 872 (8)</span>, 893, 894 (43 S. E. 280). The judge has a discretion in regulating and controlling the business of the court, and the appellate court should never interfere with the exercise of this discretion, unless it is plainly apparent that wrong has resulted from its abuse. See Carr v. State, <span class="casemissing">76 Ga. 592</span> (2-c). Where the court sees a rule of public policy being violated, during the progress of a trial, he may, "of his own motion, call attention to it, and have the proper corrective applied." Goodman v. State, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. 509 (3)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Thus it will be seen that the court here had the full power and authority to act, and to pass, on his own motion, the order here complained of, directing the clerk of the court, an officer thereof, to act.</div><div class="casepar">2. The question now arises, could this petition be amended so as to substitute and attach to the petition a new process which was prayed for and the kind of process required under the provisions of Code (Ann. Supp.)  81-201, and to which the plaintiff was entitled, for the defective process? In Burch v. Crown Laundry, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 421</span>, 424 (50 S. E. 2d, 768), this court ruled that "Although, the purported process attached to the petition . . . was void, and although its service was void, and although process was not waived by any act or conduct of either of the corporations at whom the void process was directed, yet the plaintiffs had filed petitions in court showing a plaintiff and a defendant, and setting out sufficiently and specifically some particular face or transaction as a cause of action. Section 81-1301 of the Code provides as follows: 'All parties, whether plaintiffs or defendants, in the superior or other courts, whether at law or in equity, may at any stage of the cause, as matter of right, amend their pleadings in all respects, whether in matter of fond or of substance, provided there is enough in the pleadings to amend by.' Section 81-1302 provides in part as follows: 'A petition showing a plaintiff and a defendant, and setting out sufficient to implicate and specify some particular fact or transaction as a cause of action, shall be enough to amend by.' " This court further held in that case that the omission of the prayer for process was amendable and that the clerk could, after the same had been so amended, properly be directed to add to the petition a new process. The Supreme Court, upon application, granted a certiorari in that case and on certiorari hearing, affirming this court, held: "The attaching of process to a petition which has been amended by adding a prayer for process" was proper. Crown Laundry v. Burch, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 211</span> (53 S. E. 2d, 116). "Process is the means whereby a court compels the appearance of a defendant before it or a compliance with its demands." Neal-Millard Co. v. Owens, <span class="casemissing">115 Ga. 959</span> (42 S. E. 266). Code  81-201 directs the clerk of the court in which the petition is filed to attach a proper process requiring the defendants to be and appear in court to answer the petition within thirty days after service of the petition. The old law provided that the defendant was to be and appear at the next term of the court to be held in the county. Code  81-202 then directs that the clerk shall deliver the original petition, with process annexed (referring to a proper process which it is the duty of the clerk to attach), together with a copy thereof, to the sheriff or his deputy who shall serve the sane. Such cases as Scarborough v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">67 Ga. 576</span>, and Nicholas v. British American Assurance Co., <span class="casemissing">109 Ga. 621</span> (34 S. E. 1004), deal with the question of amending void process or supplying process where the clerk has failed to attach the proper process to the petition at the time the same was filed with him, and do not deal with the question of the clerk's inadvertently attaching to such petition, when filed, the old form of process instead of the new one as required under the present Code, and as prayed for by the plain-</div><div class="casepar">It will be noted that in principle the only difference between the instant case and the Crown Laundry Co. cases, supra, is that in the instant case the court acted on its own motion, whereas in the Crown Laundry Company cases, the plaintiff made a motion for the application of the corrective measures in procedure. As we have shown above, this difference is immaterial.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the court did not err for any of the reasons assigned in passing the order and rendering the judgment excepted to.</div><div class="casepar">3. It appearing that the judgment complained of and assigned as error in this court was not improper, it becomes unnecessary to pass upon the motion of the defendants in error to dismiss the bill of exceptions.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
