The assignments of error in the bill of exceptions in the present case require a consideration of the nature and character of an equitable cross petition, to determine whether it was properly dismissed, and this court has jurisdiction of the case on review.</div><div class="casepar">2. A condemnor may dismiss its condemnation proceedings prior to the time the award of the assessors has been made, and thereafter file a second petition seeking to condemn a part of the lands of the condemnee sought to be condemned in the first petition.</div><div class="casepar">The Housing Authority of the City of College Park, alleging that it is "a public body corporate and politic exercising public and essential government function," duly organized pursuant to the Housing Authorities Law (Ga. L. 1937, p. 210 et seq., as amended), brought a petition in Fulton Superior Court seeking to condemn described property of P. M. Howard to be used in a public housing project located in the City of College Park. The proceeding was brought in rem under the provisions of Code  36-1104, as amended. On July 3, 1963, an order was entered that the petition be filed, and that all persons at interest appear on July 24, 1963. On October 7, 1963, Howard filed general and special demurrers to the petition for condemnation, and on October 29, 1963, he filed an answer and cross petition. On November 13, 1963, the Housing Authority filed general and special demurrers to Howard's answer and cross petition, and an answer to the cross petition. On December 3, 1963, Howard filed an amendment to his answer and cross petition. On the same date an order was entered sustaining one of the special demurrers of the Housing Authority to Howard's answer and cross petition, the other grounds of demurrer not being passed on. On December 17, 1963, the Housing Authority filed an amendment to its condemnation petition.</div><div class="casepar">On January 31, 1964, the attorney for the Housing Authority filed for record in the case in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County a letter dismissing the case. On the same date the attorney for the Housing Authority paid the total costs through the date of filing the letter, and the Clerk of the Superior Court entered a notation on the bar docket of the case in his office as follows: "Dismissed by condemnor."</div><div class="casepar">On March 12, 1964, Howard filed an amendment to his cross petition in the first condemnation proceeding seeking to recover attorney's fees in the sum of $10,000 against the Housing Authority. On March 16, 1964, a motion was presented by Howard seeking to enjoin further proceedings in the second condemnation proceeding, and to enjoin Fulton County from filing a condemnation suit against the land included in the first petition but omitted from the second petition, it being the contention of Howard that there was no dismissal of the first condemnation proceeding. On April 3, 1964, an order was signed by Judge Durwood T. Pye requiring the respondents to show cause why the temporary relief sought should not be given. The respondents were temporarily enjoined as prayed, and Fulton County was made a party to the case.</div><div class="casepar">On March 24, 1964, the Housing Authority filed a motion seeking an order declaring that its dismissal of the first petition was effective to terminate litigation in that proceeding, and requiring the condemnee to file defensive pleadings prior to May 4, 1964. A hearing was set on May 4, 1964, on this motion.</div><div class="casepar">Prior to May 4, 1964, with the consent of both parties, the following question was presented to Judge Pye for determination: "Was condemnor's alleged dismissal of case number A-101,474 [the petition filed by the Housing Authority on July 3, 1963] effective to terminate litigation in case number A-101,474, or is said case number A-101,474 now pending on the alleged affirmative pleadings (cross petition) of P. M. Howard therein?" After hearing argument of counsel for both parties, and considering the pleadings in both cases and the stipulation of facts by the parties, Judge Pye took the matter under advisement. On April 28, 1964, Judge Pye passed an order in the second case holding that the condemnor's dismissal of the first case was effective to terminate all litigation in that case, and that all orders entered in the second case are modified accordingly.</div><div class="casepar">P. M. Howard in his bill of exceptions assigns error on the order of April 28, 1964, and on the order of May 4, 1964, dismissing his cross petition in the first case. The Housing Authority of the City of College Park and Fulton County are named as defendants in error.</div><div class="casepar"> In the order of May 4, 1964, (the only order excepted to which was entered in the case under review) it was held that the condemnor's dismissal of its first petition was effective to terminate all litigation in that case, and it was ordered that the cross petition of the condemnee in the first case be dismissed. The questions made by the assignments of error on this order do not require a ruling as to whether or not the cross petition of the condemnee stated a cause of action, but they do require an exploration of the nature and character of the equitable cross petition to determine whether the dismissal of the petition of the condemnor was effective to dismiss the cross petition of the condemnee. This court, and not the Court of Appeals, has jurisdiction of the questions made concerning the dismissal of the equitable cross petition. Harrell v. Parker, <span class="casemissing">186 Ga. 760 (1) (198 SE 776)</span>; Hicks v. Atlanta Trust Co., <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 314</span>, 315 (3) (<span class="casemissing">200 SE 301</span>); Kidd v.

Lamb, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 455 (22 SE2d 74)</span>; Wild v. Krenke, <span class="casemissing">206 Ga. 83 (55 SE2d 544)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. In Central Georgia Power Co. v. Nolan, <span class="casemissing">135 Ga. 443 (2) (69 SE 561)</span>, it was held: "While a condemnor under the power of eminent domain may not have the right, by dismissal or abandonment after award, to escape the results of it and institute a new proceeding to condemn the same property, yet where a condemnor had the right to dismiss a condemnation proceeding while it was in an inchoate state and subject to dismissal, the exercise of such right did not operate as a bar to the institution of a second proceeding for the purpose of condemning."</div><div class="casepar">In Central of Georgia R. Co. v. Thomas, <span class="casemissing">167 Ga. 110 (144 SE 739)</span>, condemnation proceedings had been instituted and an award of assessors had been made. Within ten days from the making of the award, and before its filing with the clerk of the superior court, the condemnor dismissed the entire proceeding. Subsequently, the condemnor attempted to file a second condemnation proceeding, which the condemnee sought to enjoin. The case of Central Georgia Power Co. v. Nolan, <span class="casemissing">135 Ga. 443</span>, supra, was distinguished, and it was held that equity will not allow a condemnor, "after having had the benefit of a trial before assessors," to dismiss the first proceeding and institute a second proceeding. P. 113.</div><div class="casepar">In the present case, at the time the clerk entered the dismissal by the condemnor there had been no award by assessors, and no determination of the issues made by the cross petition of the condemnee seeking to enjoin the condemnation proceeding. The condemnor in the present case had the right to dismiss the first petition, and thereafter to file a second petition seeking to condemn a part of the lands of the condemnee sought to be condemned in the first petition. The dismissal was effective on the date of January 31, 1964.</div><div class="casepar">3. Code  3-510 provides: "The plaintiff in any action, in any court, may dismiss his action either in vacation or term time, if he shall not thereby prejudice any right of the defendant, and if done in term time, the clerk of court . . . shall enter such dismissal on the docket. After a plea of set-off or otherwise shall have been filed, the plaintiff may not dismiss his action so as to interfere with said plea, unless by leave of the court on sufficient cause shown, and on terms prescribed by the court."</div><div class="casepar">The answer of the condemnee in the present case, after denying the allegations of the petition of the condemnor, included a cross petition asserting equitable rights. This court has held that all matters in opposition to a petition to condemn property must be filed in the condemnation proceeding, when the petition is filed under the provisions of Chapter 36-11 of the Code. Mitchell v. State Highway Dept., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/38/index.html">216 Ga. 517</a></span> (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../169/38/index.html">118 SE2d 88</a></span>, 93 ALR2d 459). It is strongly urged by the condemnee that the condemnor by the dismissal of the proceeding could not effectuate the dismissal of the cross petition, and that the trial judge erred in dismissing the cross petition of the condemnee.</div><div class="casepar">We summarize the allegations of the lengthy cross petition of the condemnee as follows: The power of eminent domain sought to be exercised by the condemnor purports to be based upon the provisions of the "Housing Authorities Law" of 1937 (Ga. L. 1937, pp. 210-230), as amended. The only provision of such law and the amendments thereto applicable to a proceeding involving undeveloped, vacant land, such as is sought to be condemned in the present proceeding, is Section 15 of the Redevelopment Act of 1946, as added by an amendment thereto by Ga. L. 1951, pp. 683, 690 (Code Ann.  99-1214a), and the condemnor is not entitled to use the provisions of Section 15 because the City Council did not pass the resolution required by this section prior to filing the condemnation proceeding, and because Section 15 is unconstitutional for stated reasons. The provisions of the Acts of 1937, 1939, 1946, and 1951 granting the power of eminent domain to a housing authority (Ga. L. 1937, pp. 210, 223; Ga. L. 1939, pp. 112, 121; Ga. L. 1946, pp. 157, 160; Ga. L. 1951, pp. 683, 687) violate the due process clause of the State Constitution. The condemnee's property is forest land, and is not a slum area. The State Highway Department has planned a limited access highway 200 feet in depth along the south side of the property. The condemnor purportedly seeks to condemn the land for public housing purposes but does not intend to use all of it for those purposes, intending to deed the strip 200 feet in depth to the State Highway Department, or Fulton County, for limited access highway purposes. For these, and other alleged reasons, the exercise of the power of eminent domain as applied to the facts in this case is contrary to the due process of law provision of the Constitution, being arbitrary, capricious, and in bad faith. Stated sections of the Acts of 1937, 1939, 1946, and 1951 are contrary to the Constitution, Art. I, Sec. I, Par. III (Code Ann.  2-103); Art. I, Sec. III, Par. I (Code Ann. Supp.  2-301); and Article XVI, entitled "Slum Clearance," (Code Ann. Supp.  2-8501); both as a matter of constitutional construction, and in their application to the facts of the case. The act of the condemnor in passing a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the property of the condemnee is necessary for its purposes, and its act in seeking to acquire by condemnation the property of the condemnee for low-rent hous-</div><div class="casepar">ing purposes, are contrary to the Constitution, Art. XVI (Code Ann. Supp.  2-8501). The terms "slum" and "housing project" are defined in stated sections of the Housing Authority Law, as amended, and such sections can not be construed to include the property of the condemnee sought to be taken, since such property is forest land, and to construe the terms "slum area" and "housing project," as defined by the General Assembly, to include this property would be contrary to the Constitution, Art. XVI (Code Ann. Supp.  2-8501). The terms "blighted areas" and "redevelopment project" as defined in Ga. L. 1946, pp. 157, 159, as amended by Ga. L. 1951, pp. 683, 685 (Code Ann.  99-1203a) can not be construed to include the property of condemnee, and to construe such terms as applying to the property is contrary to the Constitution, Art. XVI (Code Ann. Supp.  2-8501). The resolutions under which the condemnor is seeking to condemn the property are illegal because they were passed at a meeting that was held illegally. No public hearing has been held by the condemnor with respect to the land of the condemnee sought to be acquired as required by provisions of a cited Act of Congress. An Act approved March 9, 1962 (Ga. L. 1962, pp. 734, 735), is contrary to the Constitution, Art. I, Sec. I, Par. XXIII (Code Ann.  2-123); and Art. I, Sec. IV, Par. I (Code Ann.  2-401).</div><div class="casepar">The prayers of the answer and cross petition were that the condemnation suit be dismissed; that the cross petition of the condemnee be sustained; that the condemnor be enjoined, both temporarily and permanently, from proceeding with the condemnation of the land; and for further general relief.</div><div class="casepar">"Where the answer of the defendant is purely defensive, the plaintiff may dismiss his action, either in term or vacation, without any leave or order of the court." Davenport v. Hardman, <span class="casemissing">184 Ga. 518 (192 SE 11)</span>. "The provisions of the Code section cited above [Code  3-510], that the plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the action 'if he shall not thereby prejudice any right of the defendant,' refers to those rights which are specified in the last sentence of the section, to wit, equitable claims by way of setoff or otherwise, which the defendant sets up in his answer." Trusco Finance Co. v. McGee, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../196/42/index.html">206 Ga. 382</a></span>, 384 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../196/42/index.html">57 SE2d 184</a></span>); Daniel v. Etheredge, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 860 (22 SE2d 807)</span>; Spence v. Dyal, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga. 739 (44 SE2d 658)</span>. In Harry L. Winter, Inc. v. Peoples Bank of Calhoun, <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 385</span>, 393 (<span class="casemissing">143 SE 387</span>), this court quoted with approval from Corpus Juris as follows: "The plaintiff may dismiss any claim where such dismissal will not prejudicially affect the interests of defendant, but he will not be permitted to dismiss, to discontinue, or to take a nonsuit, when by so doing defendant's rights will be prejudiced, or he will be deprived of any just defense. Nevertheless, the injury which will thus be occasioned to defendant must be of such a character that it deprives him of some substantive rights concerning his defenses not available in a second suit or that may be endangered by the dismissal, and not the mere ordinary inconveniences of double litigation which in the eye of the law would be compensated by costs."</div><div class="casepar">All of the matters set up in the answer and cross petition of the condemnee were defensive to the petition seeking condemnation of his property. When the condemnor dismissed its condemnation proceeding, there was nothing to enjoin in that case, and the litigation was terminated. Defenses to the new condemnation petition must be filed in that proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge did not err in dismissing the cross petition of the condemnee.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
