Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge McKenzie.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">B. L. I. Construction Company (appellee-general contractor) brought suit against Institutional Investors Trust (appellant-construction lender/grantee in security deed) to recover $360,782.50, which amount represented the balance due, including retainage for services rendered and materials furnished, for the erection of an apartment complex. In addition to a general (in personam)judgment, appellee sought to have its contractor's lien declared superior to the lender's title and also prayed for actual and punitive damages for certain allegedly fraudulent actions by the lender. In an earlier appeal involving IIT's cross claim for the balance due on a promissory note, this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the construction lender against the owner/borrower (Hinton). See Claude A. Hinton, Jr., Inc. v. Institutional Investors Trust, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../587/55/index.html">133 Ga. App. 364 (211 SE2d 169)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The instant suit was predicated on the following legal theories <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> raised in appellee's amended and consolidated complaint:</div><div class="casepar">I. BLI's commencement of work under the contract (with notice to IIT) prior to the granting of IIT's deed to secure debt established a lien superior to the title of IIT. See, e.g., Oglethorpe Sav. &amp;c. Co. v. Morgan, <span class="casemissing">149 Ga. 787</span>, 793 (<span class="casemissing">102 SE 528</span>).</div><div class="casepar">II. IIT's participation in the negotiation of the terms of the construction contract between BLI and the owner/developer (Hinton), including requirements by appellant concerning the withholding of construction loan retainage, and IIT's approval of the contract waived any priority of appellant's deed to secure debt over the appellee's contractor's lien. See, e.g., Williams v. Brewton, <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 164 (152 SE 441)</span> as limited by Ga. State Sav. Assn. v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">189 Ga. 21</span>, 26-29 (<span class="casemissing">5 SE2d 14</span>).</div><div class="casepar">III. IIT's conduct, contrary to assurances to BLI that funds would be available to pay construction costs, in depleting undisbursed construction loan proceeds by directly debiting the loan account and crediting IIT for monthly interest installments due on the construction loan, without notice to BLI and with knowledge of BLI's detrimental reliance on the loan account for payment, resulted in an equitable estoppel against the assertion by IIT of any alleged priority of its security deed over appellee's lien.</div><div class="casepar">IV. IIT's conduct in accepting and receiving the benefit of BLI's work without payment rendered IIT liable for the reasonable value of the services and also resulted in an equitable lien on the property superior to appellant's security interest. (The quantum meruit theory was not submitted to the jury.)</div><div class="casepar">V. IIT perpetrated a fraud by silence in concealing from BLI that IIT and the owner/borrower/developer had agreed to apply construction loan funds toward the payment of interest due on the construction loan, thereby dissipating the loan proceeds and retainage on which BLI had relied for payment of construction work costs.</div><div class="casepar">This appeal is from a judgment entered on a jury verdict against the construction lender, Institutional Investors Trust (IIT), in favor of a contractor's lien in the amount of $350,000, which lien was declared superior in priority to IIT's security deed to the property (but for the fact that bond had been posted), and awarding $10,782 as general and $100 as punitive damages. We reverse the judgment.</div><div class="casepar">1. In two enumerations of error which are argued jointly, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in entering a verdict in favor of BLI because a verdict in favor of IIT was required by the law and the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">A. Appellant argues that a verdict was demanded in its favor on the ground that appellee failed to establish any notice of a claim of lien, which notice was essential to authorize a finding that IIT took subject to a contractor's lien. See, e.g., Marbut-Williams Lumber Co. v. Dixie Elec. Co., <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 42 (142 SE 270)</span>. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">The owner/developer testified that he had called the corporate officers of IIT in New York and informed the president of appellant by telephone (prior to the closing of the loan and IIT's taking of a security deed on the property) that BLI had started work: clearing, grading and leveling operations were in progress, batter boards had been erected, lumber delivered, and the property had been flagged. The president of appellant acknowledged the telephone conversation, but denied that any discussion of work in progress had taken place. This testimony was properly admitted (see Division 3, infra) and raised a jury question as to whether IIT had notice of a valid claim of lien, i.e., " 'such notice as is positively proved to have been given to [the grantee of the security deed] directly and personally, or such as [the grantee] is presumed to have received personally because the evidence within [its] knowledge was sufficient to put [it] upon inquiry [i.e., that labor and materials were being furnished under contract].' [Cit.]" Caldwell v. Northwest Atlanta Bank, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 370</span>, 375 (<span class="casemissing">21 SE2d 619</span>). If the jury chose to believe the owner's testimony that the president of appellant had actual notice that work under the contract was in progress, then a verdict that IIT took its title subject to BLI's lien was proper. Oglethorpe Sav. &amp;c. Co. v. Morgan, supra; Picklesimer v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">164 Ga. 600 (1) (139 SE 72)</span>; Wager v. Carrollton Bank, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 783 (120 SE 116)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to appellant's assertions, the owner's testimony was not without probative value on the ground that the owner had executed an affidavit at closing to the effect that no improvements or repairs had been made on the property within 90 days prior to the execution thereof, or if improvements or repairs had been made within that time, the improvements or repairs were completed and paid for in full. See generally Wooster v. Boles, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../596/79/index.html">130 Ga. App. 542 (203 SE2d 745)</a></span>. Cf. Benn v. McBride, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../565/75/index.html">140 Ga. App. 698 (3) (231 SE2d 438)</a></span>, allowing testimony to contradict a written statement under oath made in connection with a judicial proceeding.</div><div class="casepar">Nor was the owner estopped by the above-mentioned affidavit from asserting that the facts were otherwise. While a lending institution may in good faith rely on a contractor's affidavit that there were no unpaid bills for labor or materials outstanding at the time of the loan and defeat a claim of lien asserted by one who has supplied materials under a contract with that contractor (Builders Supply Co. v. Pilgrim, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/78/index.html">115 Ga. App. 85 (2) (153 SE2d 657)</a></span>), the self-serving affidavit involved herein (executed by the owner Hinton) will not, by itself, defeat a claim of lien asserted by the contractor against the lending institution. Old Stone Mtg. &amp;c. Trust v. New Ga. Plumbing, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../565/72/index.html">140 Ga. App. 686 (3) (231 SE2d 785)</a></span>. See also Reynolds v. Magbee Bros. Lumber &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../636/06/index.html">117 Ga. App. 252 (3) (160 SE2d 531)</a></span>, revd. on other grounds <span class="casecite"><a href="../../147/07/index.html">224 Ga. 379 (162 SE2d 327)</a></span>. See also 20 EGL 92, Liens,  106.</div><div class="casepar">B. IIT submits that there was no evidence to authorize the establishment of a special lien superior to IIT's security deed based on the theory that IIT (grantee/lending institution) expressly or impliedly consented to improvements on its secured property by some definite and affirmative act on IIT's part communicated to, and subsequently relied on by, BLI. See Williams v. Brewton, supra, as limited by Ga. State Sav. Assn. v. Wilson, supra. See also White v. Rome Bank &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../564/81/index.html">140 Ga. App. 431 (231 SE2d 448)</a></span>, for recognition of the limitation placed on Williams. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">BLI urges that the lien is authorized by evidence of IIT's notice to BLI of approval of the loan and evidence that, at IIT's instance, a provision in the contract between BLI and the owner/developer pertaining to retainage had been modified. This evidence is not sufficient. Whatever the obligations flowing by reason of the lending agreement from IIT to the borrower (see Mutual Fed. Sav. v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../612/99/index.html">124 Ga. App. 68 (183 SE2d 50)</a></span>), under the evidence as developed no obligations flowed from IIT to BLI by reason of a contract consent theory. Lummus Supply Co. v. Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp;c. Assn., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../562/74/index.html">141 Ga. App. 831 (234 SE2d 671)</a></span>. See also Reid v. Saul, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../541/63/index.html">146 Ga. App. 264 (246 SE2d 121)</a></span>; Stewart Bros. v. General Improvement Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../552/65/index.html">143 Ga. App. 258 (238 SE2d 259)</a></span>, where, upon owner/borrower's default in interest payments, construction lender refused to pay contractor for improvements.</div><div class="casepar">We agree with IIT's contention in a related enumeration (No. 27) that the charge authorizing the award of a lien on this legal theory was not supported by the evidence and was, accordingly, erroneous.</div><div class="casepar">C. Appellee submits that the work performed prior to the date of the recordation of IIT's security deed was not such work as would constitute lienable items under the Georgia lien laws.</div><div class="casepar">Under Code Ch. 67-20, as against a third person with actual notice, the lien of a contractor on real estate improved under a contract with the owner thereof, if and when properly created and declared, attaches from the time the work under contract is commenced. Oglethorpe Sav. &amp;c. Co. v. Morgan, supra. See also Guaranty Invest. &amp;c. Co. v. Athens Engineering Co., <span class="casemissing">152 Ga. 596 (110 SE 873)</span>. Evidence was presented that the following work was in progress under the contract between the owner (Hinton) and the contractor (BLI) prior to the taking and recordation of IIT's security deed: flagging, clearing, grading and leveling operations, erection of batter boards, excavation of footings, and pouring concrete. Whatever the law might be in other jurisdictions as to the accrual of a contractor's lien (see 1 ALR3d 822), we hold that this testimony was sufficient evidence of the commencement of the work to authorize the attachment of the lien prior to IIT's security interest and the declaration of a superior lien if otherwise appropriate.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's reliance on D. H. Overmyer Warehouse Co. v. W. C. Caye &amp; Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/86/index.html">116 Ga. App. 128</a></span> (1a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/86/index.html">157 SE2d 68</a></span>) as being authoritative precedent for its contention is misplaced. That case holds that the work performed was not such that a lien would attach in the first instance: it does not concern what constitutes the time the work under contract is commenced for the purposes of determining the accrual of a contractor's lien. See also Code Ann.  67-2001 (3), which is not applicable to the instant case but represents an apparent attempt by the legislature to abrogate in part the holding in Overmyer.</div><div class="casepar">D. As noted earlier, in addition to seeking the Ch. 67-20 statutory lien, BLI's amended and consolidated complaint prayed for the establishment of an equitable lien on the grounds that IIT was, by its conduct, equitably estopped from asserting the priority of its security interest. See, e.g., G. E. C. Corp. v. Levy, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../628/82/index.html">119 Ga. App. 59 (2) (166 SE2d 376)</a></span>, as to BLI's right to plead in the alternative. IIT urges that BLI may not seek equity because of certain conduct on the part of BLI.</div><div class="casepar">Since we hold elsewhere in this opinion that the evidence in this case is insufficient to raise an equitable estoppel against IIT (see Division 17), conduct which might bar BLI from raising the estoppel issue is irrelevant and need not be considered.</div><div class="casepar">E. Citing MacLeod v. Belvedale, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../643/00/index.html">115 Ga. App. 444 (154 SE2d 756)</a></span>, counsel for IIT urges that the evidence demanded a finding that BLI abandoned the contract by stopping performance upon the mere apprehension of nonpayment by the owner. IIT argues that BLI cannot demonstrate the substantial compliance with the contract necessary to support the establishment of a special lien. See generally Code Ann.  67-2002 (1).</div><div class="casepar">In support of its contentions, IIT cites a telegram from BLI to IIT and the deposition of the president of BLI. This evidence is to the effect that BLI had discontinued construction on the project due to nonpayment. At trial, the president of BLI disputed the evidence in both the deposition and the telegram. The president testified that BLI had never discontinued, much less abandoned, construction. There was further testimony that the telegram was sent after payment was past due. See Chandler v. Buss, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../612/69/index.html">125 Ga. App. 882 (189 SE2d 479)</a></span>, holding that statements in a deposition may be used to impeach a witness, but not to estop a witness from testifying in contradiction thereto.</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to IIT's contention, the evidence did not demand a finding that BLI abandoned the contract and stopped work upon the mere apprehension of the owner's nonpayment. Compare MacLeod, supra. The evidence did not even demand a finding that the contract had been abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">F. The original complaint in this action was filed on November 30, 1973. On September 26, 1974, more than one year after the September 25, 1973, claim for lien was filed, the complaint was amended by a count praying for the establishment of a special lien. IIT, citing G &amp; B Contractors, Inc. v. Coronet Developers, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../586/19/index.html">134 Ga. App. 916 (216 SE2d 705)</a></span>, urges that BLI was barred from foreclosing its lien as the 12-month statute of limitation for foreclosure had expired. See Code Ann.  67-2002 (3). This argument is not well taken.</div><div class="casepar">In response to IIT's argument, BLI points out that on January 25, 1974, an amended complaint was filed which requested that the security deed of IIT be declared subordinate to "plaintiff's lien . . . to be established in this action." These arguments concerning the time when BLI sought to establish a special lien on the property are not relevant in determining whether BLI has satisfied statutory requirements of 67-2002 (3). "[T]he 12-month period allowed for filing which is a condition precedent to the obtaining of the lien refers to 'an action against the contractor [as being the entity primarily liable] and has no reference to the time within which the lien must be enforced.' " Adair Mtg. Co. v. Allied Concrete Enterprises, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/23/index.html">144 Ga. App. 354</a></span>, 357 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../549/23/index.html">241 SE2d 267</a></span>), affd. <span class="casecite"><a href="../../944/3/index.html">241 Ga. 121 (243 SE2d 888)</a></span>. As the record shows that BLI commenced an in personam action against the owner/developer within 12 months after the debt became due (see Old Stone Mtg. &amp;c. Trust v. New Ga. Plumbing, Inc., supra, Division 1), BLI fulfilled the condition precedent to the assertion of its lien. Allied Asphalt Co. v. Cumbie, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../586/30/index.html">134 Ga. App. 960 (2) (216 SE2d 659)</a></span>; Adair Mtg. Co., supra. See generally Steenhuis v. Todd's Const. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../126/52/index.html">231 Ga. 709 (6) (203 SE2d 530)</a></span>, where the Supreme Court upheld the establishing of a judgment as a special lien even though no prayer for relief requested such a lien.</div><div class="casepar">G. The evidence shows that in addition to the claim of lien recorded September 25, 1973, which is the subject of the instant action, BLI filed for record a claim of lien for at least part of the same debt on August 30, 1973. On September 20, 1973, this first lien was marked "Paid Satisfied and Ordered Cancelled." IIT asserts that an accord and satisfaction resulted when IIT released the lien on September 20, 1977, and that BLI could not thereafter claim the second lien because the second lien was extinguished by the satisfaction of the first.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence cited by IIT in support of the alleged satisfaction was that the president of appellee agreed to release the lien and authorized it to be satisfied upon being told by the owner that IIT would not disburse loan proceeds until the lien had been lifted.</div><div class="casepar">BLI offered evidence that the debt which was in fact the subject of the August 30 lien was not fully paid (Security Financial Corp. v. Blackwood, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../655/89/index.html">111 Ga. App. 850 (143 SE2d 515)</a></span>; see generally Complete AAA Mfg. Corp. v. C &amp; S Nat.

App. 450 (1) (167 SE2d 734)</a></span>) and that the full amount which was the subject of the September 25 claim of lien had not been satisfied.</div><div class="casepar">It is to be noted that IIT cites no evidence that BLI accepted any payment conditioned on BLI's not filing a future claim of lien for unpaid labor and materials which were the subject of the August 30 claim of lien. Under these facts, a finding of satisfaction was not demanded.</div><div class="casepar">In a related enumeration (No. 44), IIT urges that the satisfaction issue was established as a matter of law and should not have been presented to the jury. Based on the analysis in this subdivision, this enumeration is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">H. IIT cites no authority for the proposition that the September 25, 1973, lien did not attach from the commencement of the work so as to predate the recordation of IIT's security deed, but rather attached from the date of the allegedly satisfied first lien. We find this argument unpersuasive.</div><div class="casepar">I. The building contract between BLI and Hinton provided that the issuance of an architect's certificate was one precondition to final payment. The undisputed evidence shows that such a certificate was never issued. IIT, relying on Southern Mfg. Co. v. R. L. Moss Mfg. Co., <span class="casemissing">13 Ga. App. 847 (2) (81 SE 263)</span> as controlling authoritative precedent, submits that BLI, as a matter of law, had no right to foreclose the lien sought in its action. We must take issue with IIT's position.</div><div class="casepar">IIT's reliance on Southern Mfg. Co. is misplaced. The evidence shows that the architect responsible for issuing the final certificate was under the employ of IIT. The record contains a court order that the architect either issue the certificate sought by BLI or explain why in good faith such certificate had not been issued sooner. The architect did not comply with this order. This failure raised a question as to estoppel which would preclude the insistence upon the certificate of the architect. See Southern Mfg. Co., supra, p. 861. While one seeking to foreclose a contractor's lien for labor and materials must show substantial compliance with the contract (Code Ann.  67-2002 (1)), if the completion of the contract was prevented by the party otherwise having the right to insist on the architect's certificate, this is equivalent to completion of the contract as a remedial element.

IIT, citing Reynolds v. Magbee Bros. Lumber &amp;c. Co., supra, argues that BLI cannot foreclose its lien against IIT.</div><div class="casepar">Reynolds has no application to this case. In that case, no suit was brought against the owner/entity primarily liable. It was held that the lien claimant could not establish a right to a lien by an action against a subsequent grantee of the property, that grantee having no contractual or legal relationship with the claimant. In the instant case, suit was brought concurrently against the owner/developer, seeking both an in personam judgment and the declaration of a special lien, and against IIT, praying that IIT's security interest be subordinated to the special lien against the property to be established in the suit against Hinton. This was the proper procedure. See Maloy v. Planter's Warehouse &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../555/66/index.html">142 Ga.

Code Ann.  105-303 (misrepresentations in letters to obtain credit) and Code Ann.  20-401 (2) (promise to answer for debt or default or miscarriage of another) do not bar BLI's action.

We reject appellant's conclusion that IIT's foreclosure under deed of power cut off and extinguished the lien claimed by BLI.

Although we recognize that in Reeves there was direct evidence that the defendant had "purposely concealed, and abetted [another] in concealing from [the defrauded party] knowledge of the fact that the contract . . . had been changed," (id., p. 20) we find its principles to be applicable to the facts here alleged. The trial court properly allowed the issue to be submitted to the jury on this theory and an award of general and punitive damages would have been proper thereunder. This enumeration 1 (r)) is accordingly without merit. Because of our holding in this subdivision, it follows that Enumerations 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43, urging that there was no evidence to authorize various charges on fraud and punitive damages, are also without merit.</div><div class="casepar">P.

Contrary to IIT's assertion in Enumeration 4, the trial court did not err in admitting in evidence, over objection, testimony concerning a telephone conversation.

IIT submitted a charge to the effect that a contractor who does actual construction work without having obtained a building permit cannot claim a lien for any work performed prior to the date such building permit was obtained. The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with IIT's request, but added that if the work performed was merely preparatory to the actual construction, then the above-mentioned rule was not applicable. IIT asserts that this addition to the charge was error, misleading and prejudicial to IIT.</div><div class="casepar">Because the requested charge should not have been given, we need not rule on the effect of the court's additional language. The acts which were the subject of the jury charge do not affect when the lien will attach. Whatever the effect that the late procurement of a building permit may have on the substantial compliance with the contract provision requiring procurement of the permit before commencing construction (cf. Southern Mfg. Co., supra), and whatever the effect of the commencement of work without the permit, if required, may have had on the enforcement of the lien and whether the lien will attach in the first instance, the lien attaches on "the beginning of the work under the contract." Oglethorpe Sav. &amp;c. Co. v. Morgan, supra; Code Ann.  67-2001.</div><div class="casepar">In an enumeration related to the issue of compliance with the contract, No. 51, IIT asserts that the court erred in failing to construe a provision in the contract between BLI and Hinton requiring that work not be commenced before a construction loan was "set up." IIT submits that, as a matter of law, this meant "closing." The trial court properly refused to so hold. (We also note that BLI produced evidence that the contract parties had agreed to commence preliminary work prior to closing.)</div><div class="casepar">14. The trial court charged the jury that "the lien of a contractor on real estate improved under a contract with the owner thereof, as provided by law, if and when created and declared as required by law, attaches from the time the work under the contract is commenced, and will take priority over the title acquired after the commencing of work by the contractor and with actual notice of the contractor's claim by a grantee of a deed to secure debt from the owner of the real estate although the deed to secure debt was executed and recorded before the completion of the contract and before the claim of lien was formally filed of record."</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to IIT's contentions, notice of a claim of lien is not effected only upon a demand for payment or the filing of a claim of lien. The notice of a claim of lien referred to in the case law is not notice of the "perfected or recorded lien" (although this necessarily is sufficient), but rather is notice of the furnishing of material or performance of labor. Green v. Farrar Lumber Co., <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 30 (46 SE 62)</span>. We also note that reading this portion of the charge in context of the whole, the jury could not have been misled that the "contractor's claim" was something other than a "claim of lien." Thus, the charge is not erroneous for the reason assigned.</div><div class="casepar">In a related enumeration (No. 31) and on the same grounds urged above (i.e., that the grantee must have notice of a claim of lien and not merely that work had commenced under the contract), counsel for IIT urges that the court erred in charging to the effect that (after defining other necessary conditions) a lien would be authorized either if IIT knew prior to taking its security deed that BLI had commenced work under the contract or was put on inquiry, which inquiry would have led to knowledge that work had commenced. We reject this argument for the same reasons discussed above.</div><div class="casepar">15. The trial court charged the jury (in substantially the language of Oglethorpe Sav. &amp;c. Co., supra, p. 793), as follows: "Furthermore, a contractor's lien attaches from the time the work under the contract is commenced, although it lacks, certainly until it is recorded, the quality of constructive notice, but one who takes a deed to the property or purchases it while work is in progress, with knowledge of the contract and notice of the contractor's claim of lien, though imperfect or unrecorded at that time, must be held to take the property subject to the lien, provided that the contract is completed and the lien is declared and enforced within the time prescribed by Georgia law."</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to IIT's contention, the charge did not instruct the jury that mere knowledge that improvements are to be made will subject the title of the true owner to a lien. As such, the charge was not erroneous for that reason.</div><div class="casepar">In a related enumeration (No. 30), IIT asserts that the use of the word "must" in the charge was a directive by the court and, as such, constituted an expression of opinion. This, too, is not well taken. The portion of the charge set forth was merely a statement of the law and did not amount to an expression of opinion. Walker v. Lastinger, <span class="casemissing">141 Ga. 435</span> (3a) (<span class="casemissing">81 SE 203</span>). Cf. Flannery v. Hightower, <span class="casemissing">97 Ga. 592 (3) (25 SE 371)</span>. The total charges as given, when taken as a whole, fully informed the jury that it was their task to determine the facts and that, in the event the jury found certain facts, then they would be authorized (but not required) to find in favor of a lien.</div><div class="casepar">16. In Enumeration 32, IIT argues that the repetition of charges defining actual notice constituted error. Because it is necessary to reverse this case, we need not consider this contention. But see, e.g., Harper v. Daniel, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../587/68/index.html">133 Ga. App. 400 (5) (211 SE2d 5)</a></span>; and Mullis v. Chaika, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../631/91/index.html">118 Ga. App. 11 (3) (162 SE2d 448)</a></span>. Such repetition of charges is unlikely to occur on retrial.</div><div class="casepar">17. In accordance with BLI's written request, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of estoppel by conduct (see Bennett v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 58</span>, 63 (<span class="casemissing">39 SE2d 3</span>)) and the doctrine of equitable estoppel (Code Ann.  38-116). We agree with IIT's assertion that the charges were not authorized by the evidence in this case.</div><div class="casepar">Count 2 of BLI's amended and consolidated complaint alleged as an independent ground for recovery that, even assuming the statutory lien arising by operation of Ch. 67-20 was inferior to IIT's security deed, IIT was estopped by its conduct from asserting the priority of its security deed over BLI's lien.</div><div class="casepar">In support of these instructions and, thus, the presentation of these legal theories to the jury, BLI cites evidence of the following conduct on IIT's part: IIT's insistence prior to approval of Hinton's loan application that the retainage provision in the contract between BLI and Hinton be extended to cover the duration of construction; IIT's insistence that BLI execute an option granting IIT the right, at IIT's election, to insist on the completion of the project by BLI in the event of Hinton's default on the loan; IIT's actions which resulted in construction loan funds not being sufficient to cover the construction contract balance; and IIT's conduct in failing to inform BLI of those actions in spite of IIT's knowledge of BLI's reliance on the loan proceeds and retainage being available.</div><div class="casepar">In essence, BLI is alleging that IIT's above-mentioned conduct adversely influenced BLI's right to a special lien on the property superior to IIT's security deed. Because "[t]he representations or conduct relied on to raise the estoppel must have been concurrent with or anterior to the action which they are alleged to have influenced" (Smith v. Hanna Mfg. Co., <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. App. 475</span>, 487 (<span class="casemissing">23 SE2d 552</span>); Bennett v. Davis, supra, p. 64), the cited evidence was insufficient to authorize the subordination of IIT's security deed to BLI's asserted lien on the estoppel theory.</div><div class="casepar">The conduct alleged simply could not have affected the priority of BLI's lien. A portion of the conduct alleged occurred subsequent to commencement of the work on the project (the time from which BLI's lien would attach, once established) and subsequent to the effective date of IIT's security deed. There was no evidence that, if the conduct alleged on the part of IIT had not occurred, BLI would have commenced work under the contract sooner (as noted, the commencement of the work establishes the effective date of the established lien and therefore its order in priority).
