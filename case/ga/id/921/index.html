After passage of the statute, the superior court remained without jurisdiction to dispose of a case involving a felony "punishable by death or life imprisonment" without an indictment, and when it does so, its judgment is void. Id.</div><div class="casepar">Without an indictment, the trial court had no jurisdiction to accept Weatherbed's plea and sentence him. "When a trial court enters a judgment where it does not have jurisdiction, such judgment is a mere nullity; but an appeal from such an illegal judgment will not be dismissed but instead, the void judgment will be reversed.

A void judgment may be attacked at any time, and this is not a situation in which the limitations on this rule might apply. See Bennett v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../166/4/index.html">268 Ga. 849</a></span>, 850 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../166/4/index.html">494 SE2d 330</a></span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">For the purposes of superior court jurisdiction under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/7/70/index.html">17-7-70</a></span>, there is no distinction between "capital felonies" and felonies "punishable by death or life imprisonment"; they have the same meaning. In general parlance, malice murder is a capital felony. See Hayes v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../165/9/index.html">268 Ga. 809</a></span>, 813 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../165/9/index.html">493 SE2d 169</a></span>) (1997).

Smith v. Wilson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../144/1/index.html">268 Ga. 38</a></span>, 39 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../144/1/index.html">485 SE2d 197</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">The State suggests that because it did not seek the death penalty against Weatherbed, he was not charged with a "capital felony" within the meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/7/70/index.html">17-7-70</a></span>. This Court has previously stated that</div><div class="casepar">"[i]n our view the expression 'capital felony,' when used in our law, is merely descriptive of those felonies to which the death penalty is affixed as a punishment under given circumstances to distinguish such felonies from that class in which under no circumstances would death ever be inflicted as a penalty for the violation of the same." [Cit.]</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis in original.) Collins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../100/44/index.html">239 Ga. 400</a></span>, 402 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../100/44/index.html">236 SE2d 759</a></span>) (1977). This is also the definition that has been used in examining the precursor to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/7/70/index.html">17-7-70</a></span>. See Garmon, supra (deciding that armed robbery is not a "capital felony" within the meaning of the statute as the death penalty could no longer be imposed for this offense).</div><div class="casepar">The fact that the State did not seek the death penalty does not take this case outside the ambit of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/7/70/index.html">17-7-70</a></span>. Under the definition used in Collins, malice murder is a capital felony because it belongs to a class of case in which the death penalty can, under certain circumstances, be imposed. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/16/5/1/index.html">16-5-1</a></span> (d); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b). See, e.g., Pruitt v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../114/4/index.html">270 Ga. 745 (514 SE2d 639) (1999)</a></span>. The fact that the State has chosen not to pursue the death penalty does not change the class of case to which it belongs. Further, such choice is not dispositive in any event; although the State did not seek the death penalty when Weatherbed was sentenced under the accusation, the death penalty could still be sought in this (or a similar) case, as the State is not necessarily precluded from seeking the death penalty should the defendant be indicted. See Griffin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../199/1/index.html">266 Ga. 115</a></span>, 119-120 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../199/1/index.html">464 SE2d 371</a></span>) (1995).</div><div class="casepar">The State's argument that Weatherbed freely and voluntarily consented to the procedure and waived his right to indictment, even if true, is irrelevant. Parties cannot, by their consent, confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court that does not otherwise have it. Gray v. Gray, <span class="casecite"><a href="../132/01/index.html">229 Ga. 460</a></span>, 461 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../132/01/index.html">192 SE2d 334</a></span>) (1972).</div><div class="casepar">The case is returned to the superior court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">BENHAM, Chief Justice, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">I am in full agreement with the majority opinion's holding that Weatherbed's guilty plea to murder could not be received by the trial court absent an indictment because OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/17/7/70/index.html">17-7-70</a></span> (b) does not permit the trial court to accept a guilty plea on an accusation charging a defendant with committing a felony that is "punishable by death or life imprisonment." I write separately because I believe the time has come for this Court to comply with the change in its appellate jurisdiction in non-capital murder cases brought about by passage of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, as recognized by this Court in State v. Thornton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../622/7/index.html">253 Ga. 524 (1) (322 SE2d 711) (1984)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The appeal was filed initially in the Court of Appeals, which transferred it to this Court on the ground that "a case wherein the defendant has been indicted for murder . . . is a case 'in which a sentence of death . . . could be imposed.' " State v. Thornton, Case No. 68255, May 3, 1984 order. This Court disagreed with the Court of Appeals' jurisdictional rationale, finding that the appeal was properly filed in the Court of Appeals under the 1983 Constitution. This Court noted the effect of the then-recent change in appellate jurisdiction:</div><div class="casepar">The district attorney did not give timely notice to the defense that the state intended to seek the death penalty, Unified Appeal,  II. A. 1., 246 Ga. at A-7, and for this reason this is not a case "in which a sentence of death was imposed or could be imposed." Constitution of Georgia of 1983, Art. VI, Sec. VI, Par. III (8). Hence, this appeal was properly filed in the Court of Appeals.</div><div class="casepar">State v. Thornton, supra, <span class="casecite"><a href="../622/7/index.html">253 Ga. 524 (1)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The Thornton court recognized that the 1983 Constitution did not give this Court appellate jurisdiction of an appeal wherein the defendant, though charged with murder, could not receive the death penalty. For policy reasons not identified in the opinion, however, the Court issued an order directing the Court of Appeals to transfer to this Court "all cases in which either a sentence of death or of life imprisonment has been imposed upon conviction of murder, and all pre-conviction appeals in murder cases, whether or not timely notice was given by the district attorney as required by Unified Appeal,  II. A. 1., 246 Ga. at A-7." Id. Since then, this Court has accepted from the Court of Appeals numerous transfers of appeals from murder convictions in which the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. See, e.g., Winn v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../121/8/index.html">269 Ga. 145 (498 SE2d 56) (1998)</a></span>; In re E. W., <span class="casecite"><a href="../554/3/index.html">256 Ga. 681 (353 SE2d 175) (1987)</a></span>. In fact, the appeal at bar initially was filed in the Court of Appeals, which transferred it to this Court, citing State v. Thornton. Weatherbed v. State, Case No. A99A1701, May 7, 1999 order. While this Court has accepted the Thornton transfers, we have also continued to recognize that the 1983 Constitution gives the Court of Appeals appellate jurisdiction of appeals of murder cases in which a sentence of death cannot be imposed. See, e.g., Rhyne v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../261/9/index.html">264 Ga. 176</a></span>, 177 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../261/9/index.html">442 SE2d 742</a></span>) (1994).</div><div class="casepar">This Court's interpretation of the constitutional grant of jurisdiction in Thornton and Rhyne is supported by a straightforward reading of the language used in the 1983 Constitution. Given the use of the past tense, the phrase "cases in which a sentence of death was imposed," can only mean cases in which a defendant has been sentenced to death as a result of the judgment of conviction being appealed. The phrase "or could be imposed," on the other hand, speaks to the future and is applicable to those cases in which the possibility of the imposition of the death penalty still exists. Under current Georgia law, that would encompass the interim review phase of death penalty cases authorized by the Unified Appeal Process (Uniform Superior Court Rule 34), and interlocutory appeals arising in cases where the defendant has been charged with a crime punishable by death and the time within which the district attorney must give notice of intent to seek the death penalty has not yet expired. See USCR 34.</div><div class="casepar">This Court's Thornton order requiring the Court of Appeals to transfer to the Supreme Court all appeals of murder convictions and all pre-conviction appeals in murder cases, regardless of whether the death penalty is being sought, continued the jurisdictional line drawn by the 1976 Constitution and the judicial holdings that limited the imposition of the death penalty, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> despite the passage of the 1983 constitutional provision. It is time, however, to give effect to the 1983 Constitution's jurisdictional change which this Court acknowledged in Thornton and Rhyne.</div><div class="casepar">Although I am convinced that appellate jurisdiction over this case is properly in the Court of Appeals since the record does not reflect that the district attorney timely filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, I am able to concur in the judgment of reversal because this case was docketed in this Court in compliance with the Thornton order and should therefore be resolved here. However, I would hold that after the appearance of this opinion in the advance sheets, appeals in murder cases in which the death penalty was not imposed or could not be imposed because the State did not announce timely its intent to seek that sanction pursuant to USCR 34 are to be docketed in and decided by the Court of Appeals pursuant to Article VI, Section VI, Paragraph III (8) of the 1983 Georgia Constitution.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="casenotes"><div class="header">

      The statute discussed in Webb referred to "felony cases other than capital felonies" and "felony cases except those punishable by death or life imprisonment" in separate sentences.
