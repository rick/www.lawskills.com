(Emphasis in original.) Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 319 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). Any inconsistencies in the victim['s and witnesses'] testimony . . . go to the weight and credibility of the witnesses' testimony; such issues are for the jury to weigh. Sherman v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/18/index.html">225 Ga. App. 869 (485 SE2d 557) (1997)</a></span>; Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../280/36/index.html">220 Ga.

App. 193</a></span>, 195 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../258/57/index.html">491 SE2d 387</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">Taylor v.

App. 383</a></span>, 384-385 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../248/97/index.html">501 SE2d 875</a></span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">Viewing the evidence with all inferences in favor of the verdict, it was that, on October 29, 1996, after dusk, Veronica Simpson was in her apartment with her fourteen-year-old son and two-year-old daughter when she heard a loud banging at her front door. Upon opening the door, she encountered Simmons, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> who put a gun in her face and demanded to know where her brother was. When she said she did not know, Simmons said she would tell him or he would kill her.</div><div class="casepar">Ikenyaly Rosser, Simpson's son, came into the room and saw Simmons pointing a gun in his mother's face. Rosser told him if he killed his mother, he would kill him. Simmons then cursed Rosser and told Simpson to take him to where her brother was. He then grabbed her shirt and pushed her out onto the porch. Because she was wearing house shoes, Simpson had her son bring her some other shoes. While Simpson and Simmons were on the porch, her neighbor Angela Rome was on her way out and Simpson told her to watch her children. Rome, who acknowledged having had several beers, did not notify police, but did later get Simpson's children and take them to another neighbor's apartment.</div><div class="casepar">Sanchez Traylor, another neighbor, saw Simmons pulling Simpson down the steps and sidewalk and heard Simpson yelling that she did not want to go with him. Traylor saw a gun and called police.</div><div class="casepar">Simpson was pushed into Simmons' car on the passenger side. She could not open the door, and Simmons drove off. Simpson told Simmons about a Vine Street address where she had previously lived with her boyfriend, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> and Simmons drove there. Although lights were on, Simmons did not get out, but circled the address several times. Simmons then threatened to kill Simpson, and they struggled over the gun. During the struggle, Simmons bit Simpson on the wrist and she bit him on the head. They continued to struggle and fell out of the driver's side of the car. Simmons hit her in the head with the gun, and the clip fell out. She grabbed the clip and ran, but Simmons grabbed her and choked her, retrieving the clip. Simmons then told her he was not going to hurt her and drove off. Simpson ran to a nearby MARTA station, and police and paramedics were called.</div><div class="casepar">The paramedic examined Simpson who said she had been kidnapped, thrown from the car, and hit on the head with a gun. He found an abrasion on Simpson's head with minor bleeding. Simpson refused to be transported to the hospital, but did meet with detectives that evening and give a statement. A warrant was issued for Simmons the next day after detectives determined his last name.</div><div class="casepar">Simmons was arrested on that warrant in March 1997. When arrested, Simmons had in his car a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence of kidnapping and aggravated assault was legally sufficient. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> Jackson v. Virginia, supra.</div><div class="casepar">1. Simmons' first enumeration is that the trial court erred in allowing into evidence the fact that he had a gun in his possession when arrested because it placed his character in issue and was not in temporal proximity to the charged crimes.</div><div class="casepar">Simmons relies on Benford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../520/index.html">272 Ga. 348 (528 SE2d 795) (2000)</a></span>, in which it was stated that even</div><div class="casepar">circumstances surrounding an arrest other than for the crime for which a defendant is on trial are [not] always irrelevant and prejudicial. Anderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../239/42/index.html">236 Ga. App. 679</a></span>, 683 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../239/42/index.html">513 SE2d 235</a></span>) (1999). [Cit.] However, this Court has indicated that the admission of evidence which shows the commission of another crime may not automatically be admitted solely on the basis that the evidence was incident to an accused's arrest where the evidence is wholly unrelated to the charged crime, the arrest is remote in time from the charged crime, and the evidence is not otherwise shown to be relevant. [Cits.] Just as evidence of the circumstances connected with an accused's arrest is not automatically prejudicial neither is it automatically relevant. Rather, such evidence is subject to the same standard of relevancy and materiality applicable to other evidence. Thus, "the admission or exclusion of this evidence 'lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.' [Cit.]" [Cit.]</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis supplied.) Id. at 350 (3).</div><div class="casepar">Here, unlike in Benford, the arrest, the circumstances of which were found admissible, was for the crime for which Simmons was on trial. Also, because a handgun was used in the charged crime, Simmons' possession of a handgun at the time of his arrest was relevant and admissible. Compare Benford, supra (evidence of a .22 caliber handgun possessed at arrest for another crime not admissible when charged crime committed with shotgun) with Nealy v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../214/01/index.html">246 Ga. App. 752</a></span>, 753 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../214/01/index.html">542 SE2d 521</a></span>) (2000) (bulletproof vest worn by accused when arrested for aggravated assault with a handgun admissible in aggravated assault trial resulting from multiple weapon shootout 26 days earlier).</div><div class="casepar">There was no error.</div><div class="casepar">2. Simmons contends, in his second enumeration, that the trial court erred in allowing Rosser, "a child witness[,] to testify where the [S]tate failed to prove that he was competent to do so."</div><div class="casepar">At the beginning of the trial, defense counsel made an oral motion in limine, contending that Rosser is "a 14 year old, and we would request the check into his competency. He has several medical and mental disorders, and under the statute I believe it's the court's duty once an objection to competency has been made, to check into his competency. He is, I believe, autistic, . . . [and has] two or three other disorders." No ruling was made at that time.</div><div class="casepar">Simpson, the State's first witness, then testified that her son, Rosser, suffered from a "disorderly conduct problem," seizures, and schizophrenia, the latter of which resulted in his hearing voices. Rosser, however, took three medications for these problems, Ritalin (hyperactivity), Tegretol (seizures), and Haldol (schizophrenia).</div><div class="casepar">Before Rosser was called as a witness, Simmons' counsel asked the court if a competency hearing were necessary on the basis that "he's subject to doing whatever his mother wants and says. . . ." Simmons' counsel also questioned whether Rosser understood the difference between right and wrong and truth and a lie.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did then question Rosser outside the presence of the jury. Rosser was introduced to the court by the prosecutor, who mispronounced his name and was corrected by Rosser. The court inquired why Rosser was there, and he responded because "that man had kidnapped my momma." Rosser also responded to the court's inquiry regarding truth and a lie, indicating an understanding of the difference.</div><div class="casepar">Pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/7/index.html">24-9-7</a></span>: "(a) The competency of a witness shall be decided by the court. The court shall by examination decide upon the capacity of one alleged to be incompetent from idiocy, lunacy, insanity, drunkenness, or infancy. (b) If an objection to competency is known, it shall be taken before the witness is examined at all. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge is vested with discretion to determine the competency of witnesses, which will not be overruled absent abuse. Gallagher v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/59/index.html">196 Ga. App. 153</a></span>, 154 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../356/59/index.html">395 SE2d 358</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">Pursuant to Sizemore v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/8/index.html">262 Ga. 214 (416 SE2d 500) (1992)</a></span>, a child may no longer be challenged for competency based solely on infancy or solely on the basis that he does not comprehend the nature of an oath. Norton v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/0/index.html">263 Ga. 448</a></span>, 450 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/0/index.html">435 SE2d 30</a></span>) (1993) (showing of appreciation of the truth is all that is required).</div><div class="casepar">Everyone is presumed competent to testify. Flynn v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../571/6/index.html">255 Ga. 415</a></span>, 419 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../571/6/index.html">339 SE2d 259</a></span>) (1986); Dumas v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../229/97/index.html">239 Ga. App. 210</a></span>, 213-214 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../229/97/index.html">521 SE2d 108</a></span>) (1999). While any witness, including a child, may be challenged on the ground he does not have the use of reason, London v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../26/index.html">274 Ga. 91</a></span>, 93 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../26/index.html">549 SE2d 394</a></span>) (2001), having mental disabilities, alone, does not establish such lack of use of reason. Even having been previously judged insane or having had a guardian appointed does not amount to incompetency to testify. McClain v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../208/44/index.html">248 Ga. App. 338 (2) (545 SE2d 926) (2001)</a></span>; Bonner v. State, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. App. 737</span>, 738 (1) (<span class="casemissing">1 SE2d 768</span>) (1939).</div><div class="casepar">It is not apparent, from the motion in limine and other statements of Simmons regarding Rosser, that the court was required to inquire into Rosser's competency, since no specific basis for Rosser not having the use of reason was given, other than his mental disabilities. Webb v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/71/index.html">187 Ga. App. 348</a></span>, 350-351 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/71/index.html">370 SE2d 204</a></span>) (1988); see Roberson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../297/70/index.html">214 Ga. App. 208</a></span>, 209 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../297/70/index.html">447 SE2d 640</a></span>) (1994).</div><div class="casepar">Further, since the trial court did conduct an inquiry, there has been no abuse of discretion shown in allowing Rosser to testify. Roberson, supra; Gallagher, supra.</div><div class="casepar">3. The admission into evidence of Simmons' arrest warrant is claimed as error in the third enumeration, although no objection to its admission was voiced at trial.</div><div class="casepar">While acknowledging that this document should not have been allowed into evidence or out with the jury, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> the State contends any error was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">We agree. The warrant alleges that Simmons abducted Simpson "by force and threats with a handgun. Ms. Simpson knows the accused as Wayne, and supplied this affiant with a verbal typed statement accusing Wayne of this allegation." Both the officer who obtained the warrant and Simpson testified, as well as Simmons. Simmons acknowledged being with Simpson, but contended there was no gun and they agreed to exchange cocaine for sex. Therefore, the warrant was cumulative of admissible evidence and its admission harmless. Ansley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../350/21/index.html">198 Ga. App. 452</a></span>, 453 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../350/21/index.html">402 SE2d 73</a></span>) (1991); Nelson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../355/86/index.html">197 Ga. App. 898</a></span>, 899 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../355/86/index.html">399 SE2d 748</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">4. Simmons, as his fourth enumeration, claims error in the trial court's allowing Simpson to read, verbatim, the contents of her written statement although the document was not admitted into evidence and in allowing the prosecutor to read the victim's statement during closing argument, because the requirements of Woodard v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../125/6/index.html">269 Ga. 317 (496 SE2d 896) (1998)</a></span>, were not met.</div><div class="casepar">This argument, however, was not made below by trial counsel, as acknowledged by appellate counsel. The only objection made below to Simpson's reading her statement was that Simmons would acquiesce in this procedure "[o]nly if we can introduce the transcript [of her testimony during the preliminary hearing]." Trial counsel also objected to her reading the document because it was not the original.</div><div class="casepar">It is argued here, however, that this was "plain error."</div><div class="casepar">Although this Court will not generally consider issues not properly raised and ruled upon in the trial court, an exception exists in cases of "plain error" which is "so clearly erroneous as to result in a likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice or which seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of a judicial proceeding."

Simmons' fifth enumeration is that the trial court erred in "commenting on the evidence and responding to juror's question during deliberation in a manner [that] was prejudicial" to his case. The argument made is that the trial court violated OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/57/index.html">17-8-57</a></span>, which provides that it is error for a judge in a criminal case, "during its progress or in his charge to the jury, to express or intimate his opinion as to what has or has not been proved or as to the guilt of the accused."</div><div class="casepar">After the jury had begun deliberating, the following question was sent out: "[w]hat would happen if plaintiff [sic] . . . withdrew her statement, or refused to prosecute?" The question, its import, and suggested answers were discussed by counsel and the court. Simmons' counsel then suggested that the jury be asked, "what they mean by this. I'm not really sure."</div><div class="casepar">The court then advised the jury "we're kind of having a problem understanding exactly. . . ." At this point, the following colloquy occurred:</div><div class="casepar">A juror: Can the State charge her if she drops the charges?</div><div class="casepar">A juror: Your Honor, could I clarify? If when this case was turned over to the D. A. and Veronica Simpson decided not to pursue it any further, would the charges be dropped or is it too late?

But I think the short answer is in the hypothetical as you've given me, if you say no, I've just changed my mind. I don't want to do this, I think the answer is no.</div><div class="casepar">A juror: That's the answer to the question.</div><div class="casepar">The Court: And I'm answering specifically the hypothetical that you've given me.</div><div class="casepar">A juror: We wonder if it was illegal to say I want to drop the charges, not that I lied or I'm admitting anything, good, bad or indifferent. I just want to drop the charges. I don't want to bother anymore.</div><div class="casepar">The Court: It is not illegal to say I want to drop the charges. I'm saying that in the context of whatever one of you just said, that it's not I've committed perjury. I've lied.</div><div class="casepar">(Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">This exchange occurred at the end of the day. The next morning, Simmons' trial counsel objected that the trial court had not fully answered the jury's inquiry and requested that the jury be told that, if the victim withdrew her statement, "basically she could be prosecuted for making a false statement for perjury, obstruction of justice, violating his civil rights, those things."</div><div class="casepar">The argument made here regarding OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/57/index.html">17-8-57</a></span> is different from the argument made below.

In response to this argument, Simpson testified that Simmons' girlfriend had offered her money on four occasions in an effort to get her to drop the charges. She stated that she would not change her story because she would go to jail for perjury if she did.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not answer the jury's question specifically addressed to Simpson's changing her mind regarding proceeding with the prosecution. As stated by the court, the jury's premise was speculative. Although the court did respond to the hypothetical posed by the jury, that could not be said to be an expression of opinion by the trial court on what facts had been proven during the trial or on Simmons' guilt.

After evidence was presented and short arguments were made on the possession of a firearm charge, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and that violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act was a felony. The court then stated, "I'm going to ask you to be governed by the other charges with regard to what your burden of proof is and what the State's burden of proof is, and the other charges that I gave to you the other day and ask you to go back and deliberate on this charge."

Trial counsel did allude to the limp in his opening argument and questioned Simmons about it, but decided not to call a doctor. He had previously tried such a tactic with a client in another case and found it ineffective. Therefore, as a matter of trial strategy, trial counsel chose not to do so here.</div><div class="casepar">Again, while appellate counsel and Simmons may now disagree with this decision, that does not make it ineffective assistance of counsel, and denial of the motion for new trial on this basis was not clearly erroneous.
