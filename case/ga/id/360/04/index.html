Fulton Superior Court. Before Judge Etheridge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Anesthesia Group and Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Inc., d/b/a Humana Hospital, appeal the judgments entered on jury verdicts against each of them in this medical malpractice case brought by the representative and family of Ada Hammonds Pierce.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence at trial is construed so as to uphold the verdict. Pendley v. Pendley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../648/3/index.html">251 Ga. 30</a></span>, 31 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../648/3/index.html">302 SE2d 554</a></span>) (1983). Ms. Hammonds, the name she used professionally, was a 38-year-old Licensed Practical Nurse who worked in the delivery room at St. Joseph's Hospital. She slipped in the delivery room and injured her knee, requiring arthroscopic surgery. She was admitted by orthopedist Dr. Brand to Humana Hospital on October 4, 1983.</div><div class="casepar">Humana Hospital had contracted in 1981 with Anesthesia Group, a partnership composed of Dr. Horseman and Dr. Mahoney, for the partnership to "provide full-time Anesthesiology services and assume general responsibility for the conduct and operation of Hospital's Anesthesiology Department, subject to approval of Hospital." The contract provided that services under it would be performed as scheduled by the Hospital Administration and that Group was required to provide an anesthesiologist from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and otherwise as required by the Hospital. The partnership had to be available on 30 minutes notice for emergencies. The emergency services could be provided by a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) with an anesthesiologist available for supervision. The two partners were members of the hospital staff.</div><div class="casepar">Surgery was scheduled by Hospital based on the requests for surgery made by surgeons such as Dr. Brand. A surgery schedule was prepared around 1:00 p.m. each day, typed up by Hospital's Director of Surgery and given to Group, which would decide how to staff the needed anesthesia services. Group set a fee schedule under the contract, which was subject to approval of Hospital. Hospital did not have approval rights of fees set by other doctors. When surgery was completed, the doctor or CRNA gave a charge slip, with the patient and surgery information and anesthesia charge on it, to Hospital's administrative staffer in the operating suite. The anesthesia was billed on the hospital bill. The notation on Ms. Hammonds' bill was "Anesthesia supplies 90.88 Anesthesia hosp empe 286.00." Hospital paid Group 86 percent of the total anesthesia charges, retaining 5 percent as administrative costs and 9 percent to cover "bad debts." There was a charge back provision in the contract: if any third party provider did not pay or paid only partially, Group would reimburse Hospital. Hospital owned the accounts. Bill disputes with patients and collection were its responsibility.</div><div class="casepar">Group in turn had contracted with five Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists who worked under the partnership at Hospital. One of these CRNAs, Sarafin, visited Ms. Hammonds the evening of her admission. He introduced himself to all patients as being from the "anesthesia department." Nurses, including CRNAs, were required to wear uniforms of certain colors denoting their position. They were also provided name tags with their and the Hospital's names on it. Sarafin did the preoperative workup on Ms. Hammonds and prescribed preoperative medication. He signed Dr. Horseman's name to the orders. Dr. Horseman did not see Ms. Hammonds, nor did Sarafin consult with him concerning her.</div><div class="casepar">She was visited by CRNA Jimenez, who was scheduled to administer anesthesia. He introduced himself to patients as a CRNA or nurse anesthetist with the "anesthesia service."</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Mahoney was the floating anesthesiologist that day. He reviewed Ms. Hammonds' records in the pre-op holding area, approved the pre-op medications after they had been given, discussed for a minute or two the anesthesia plan with Jimenez, and spoke briefly with the patient.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Mahoney was not present in the operating room when anesthesia was induced nor during the surgery. Ms. Hammonds was put to sleep and then given a 100 mg. dose of Anectine at 7:05 a.m. Anectine paralyzes a patient so that the vocal cords will remain open, allowing insertion of an endotracheal tube to aid breathing during surgery. The surgery, uneventful, was completed at 7:46 a.m.</div><div class="casepar">At 7:48 a.m., the endotracheal tube was suctioned out and removed. Ms. Hammonds was suctioned again and preparations were being made to roll her onto a gurney when a laryngospasm, which interferes with breathing, was observed by Jimenez. He administered 20 mg. of Anectine at 7:51 a.m. to break the spasm. It broke for approximately three breaths but reoccurred. Dr. Brand, the surgeon, had noticed Ms. Hammonds' toes and toenails becoming cyanotic, or turning blue, about five minutes after the surgery ended. He told Jimenez, who responded that he was administering medicine.</div><div class="casepar">A second 20 mg. dose of Anectine was given at 7:56 a.m. but had no effect on the ability of Jimenez to ventilate the patient. At 8:00 a.m., circulating nurse Duffy left the operating room, went to the desk in the operating suite, and told the nurse there to find Dr. Mahoney. She got the code cart and returned to the operating room. Dr. Mahoney arrived and began to assist Jimenez. At 8:02 a.m., Jimenez gave a 100 mg. dose of Anectine, reintubated the patient, and started an i.v. drip of Anectine.</div><div class="casepar">Jimenez saw no improvement in his ability to ventilate Ms. Hammonds. Both he and Dr. Mahoney listened to her chest, but her weight (250 pounds, height 5 feet) made chest sounds less clear. Both believed she had developed a bronchospasm, which causes the small sacs in the lungs to constrict, in addition to the laryngospasm. Bronchospasm under these circumstances is extremely rare and is seldom fatal.</div><div class="casepar">During this period, Ms. Hammonds' heart rate became very slow, including at least two incidents of asystole or stoppage. Cardiac massage was used at intervals. Medications, effective both to stimulate the heart and to relax bronchospasm, were administered. At 8:07 a.m., due to the continuing difficulty, Dr. Mahoney decided to remove the second endotracheal tube and replace it with another. At 8:10 a.m., improvements in respiration began as it finally brought air to the lungs and ultimately to the brain.</div><div class="casepar">Upon arrival at the intensive care unit, the nurses noted that the abdomen was "distended and tympanic sounding." This can be caused by pumping air into the stomach from an improperly placed endotracheal tube. Ms. Hammonds never regained consciousness and remained on a respirator until she was declared brain dead and life support was removed on October 11.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A89A2007</div><div class="casepar">1. Group's first two enumerations allege error in the trial court's denial of their motion for directed verdict on the issue of negligence per se based on violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/26/9/index.html">43-26-9</a></span> (b) and the court's charge on it.</div><div class="casepar">That section provides that anesthesia may lawfully be administered by a CRNA "provided that such anesthesia is administered under the direction and responsibility of a duly licensed physician with training or experience in anesthesia." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">The allegations against Group and Hospital were that there had been a failure to exercise the degree of care generally required in the administration of anesthesia. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/1/27/index.html">51-1-27</a></span>. It was further alleged that Dr. Mahoney and CRNA Jimenez were agents and employees of Hospital.</div><div class="casepar">The contracts entered into between Group and its CRNAs described the arrangement as one not between employer and employee, but between a "contractor," Group, and "subcontractors," the CRNAs. They further stated that the arrangement was meant to make the CRNAs "independent contractors.</div><div class="casepar">" 'By statute, the physician is the only one empowered to practice medicine.' [Cit.] OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/26/9/index.html">43-26-9</a></span> makes an exception in the specialty of anesthesiology and allows a nurse who meets the qualifications of the statute to administer anesthesia under particular supervision." Central Anesthesia Assoc. v. Worthy, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../436/88/index.html">173 Ga. App. 150</a></span>, 152 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../436/88/index.html">325 SE2d 819</a></span>) (1984), affirmed <span class="casecite"><a href="../../603/5/index.html">254 Ga. 728 (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Horseman, while acknowledging that he did not understand the meanings of the terms "employee and independent contractor," believed the contract did not diminish his ability to control the CRNAs and to direct their activities in the administration of anesthesia. Nonetheless, he had given no instructions to the CRNAs as to when they should call an anesthesiologist to the operating room. He believed the understanding of the CRNAs was that they should call when they needed the doctor for "consultation."</div><div class="casepar">Jimenez said he was an independent practitioner but elected to work in a hospital "where I work with anesthesiologists so that I have their expertise to use along with my own." He described the anesthesiologist as "a consulting person and a resource person and an assistant who has a little more medical background or a lot more medical background than I do."</div><div class="casepar">The anesthesia guidelines for the Hospital state that "[t]he anesthetist responsible for the anesthesia decisions required during anesthesia management be already identified [before induction] to the patient and to any technician who may assist in such care and management, and his availability for supervision and direction be established if he is not administering the anesthesia personally." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">Two anesthesiologists testified as experts. Dr. Jeffries, for Hammonds, opined that Jimenez' actions were deficient in several respects and that the degree of supervision and direction exercised by Dr. Mahoney was not commensurate with that required in the practice of anesthesiology at that time. In his opinion, the CRNA should immediately initiate treatment and call the doctor as soon as any respiratory problems arise. Instead, Jimenez continued to try to correct the problem himself and the doctor was finally summoned by the circulating nurse. Dr. Jeffries believed that Ms. Hammonds' size made a 20 mg. dose of Anectine useless and that the 100 mg. dose should have been given initially. It was also his opinion that Jimenez' intubation at 8:02 a.m. was into the esophagus, not the trachea, taking air to the stomach and not to the lungs, which would have resulted in distention of her abdomen if allowed to continue for five minutes or more. It would not have provided needed oxygen to the brain.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Jeffries said that such intubations can occur but felt that failure to recognize that the tube was in the wrong place and failure to correct it for over five minutes caused the damage resulting in her death.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Bartel, defendants' expert, initially said that calling Dr. Mahoney after the second laryngospasm was appropriate, but added that the anesthesiologist should be called immediately when cyanosis is present. She also agreed that the 20 mg. dose was insufficient for a woman of Ms. Hammonds' size and that the second dose should have been a full 100 or 120 mg. in order to break the spasm.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant Group argues that there was no evidence that the statute had been violated, rendering the charge and denial of their motion for directed verdict error.</div><div class="casepar"> Central Anesthesia Assoc. v. Worthy, supra, holds that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/26/9/index.html">43-26-9</a></span> establishes the standard of conduct constituting ordinary care for use of CRNAs and that its violation can amount to negligence per se. See West v. Mache of Cochran, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/77/index.html">187 Ga. App. 365</a></span>, 367 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/77/index.html">370 SE2d 169 (1988)</a></span>. Worthy found that the administration of anesthesia by a registered professional nurse, in her second year of training to become a CRNA, under the supervision of a physician's assistant without the involvement in any way of the anesthesiologist, who was on a different floor when complications arose, was sufficient for the granting of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="casepar">It also held that "[t]he purpose of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/43/26/9/index.html">43-26-9</a></span> is to protect patients from the dangers of improperly administered anesthesia by those unqualified by a lack of what public policy regards as minimum education in the field, and by a lack of specified supervision. . . . The statute set[s] threshold qualifications which [have] to be met before a person would be permitted under the law to apply anesthesia. These qualifications do not establish how the anesthesia is to be administered, or what methods or instruments may be used, but rather who may do it with whose supervision. Thus it prohibits anyone not meeting these qualifications from performing, and it further prohibits even a statutorily qualified person from. performing without prescribed supervision." Id. at 153. (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, the "direction" referred to in the statute has been equated with "supervision." See Webster's Third Intl. Dictionary 640, 2296 (1981).</div><div class="casepar">As to Ms. Hammonds, there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that, because there was no clear understanding between the doctors and the CRNAs, and in particular Dr. Mahoney and Mr. Jimenez, as to when the doctor should be summoned whenever difficulties were encountered, this was a failure of the mandated degree of "direction and responsibility." Time itself was crucial here. Delay resulted in inadequate treatment of the laryngospasm for over five minutes before Dr. Mahoney was summoned.</div><div class="casepar">Group's motion for directed verdict contended that the only failure of care was the esophageal intubation, done in the presence of Dr. Mahoney, and thus as a matter of law under his "direction and responsibility." Pretermitting the issue of whether his walking in the door during the reintubation was sufficient supervision, Ross v. Chatham County Hosp. Auth., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../470/6/index.html">258 Ga. 234 (367 SE2d 793) (1988)</a></span>, the plaintiffs' theories were broader than this. They included the lack of understanding between doctor and CRNA as to when the doctor should be called and the failure to have the doctor available sooner.</div><div class="casepar">Denial of the directed verdict was not error. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (a). Marriott Corp. v. American Academy of Psychotherapists, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../501/60/index.html">157 Ga. App. 497</a></span>, 498 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../501/60/index.html">277 SE2d 785</a></span>) (1981). Horney v. Lawrence, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/94/index.html">189 Ga. App. 376</a></span>, 377 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/94/index.html">375 SE2d 629</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">The fact that the level of supervision is not more definitive in the statute is not dispositive and did not require a directed verdict. It is a standard which is subject to elucidation by experts as is any other professional standard. Loving v. Nash, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/41/index.html">182 Ga. App. 253</a></span>, 255 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../406/41/index.html">355 SE2d 448 (1987)</a></span>; see Sparks v. Hoff, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../394/84/index.html">186 Ga. App. 907</a></span>, 908 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../394/84/index.html">368 SE2d 830</a></span>). Such expert opinion was provided and resolution of the differences in the experts' opinions was for the jury. Id. The charge tracked the language of the statute and, in the absence of any particularized request to charge by Group, no further explication was required. The court's charge was sufficient. Schroeder v. Hunter Douglas, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../444/29/index.html">172 Ga. App. 897</a></span>, 901 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../444/29/index.html">324 SE2d 746</a></span>) (1984); Parrott v. Edwards, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../648/97/index.html">113 Ga. App. 422</a></span>, 429 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../648/97/index.html">148 SE2d 175</a></span>) (1966).</div><div class="casepar">2. Enumeration three alleges error in the following charge on admissions: "[I]t is contended that there have been admissions in this case, and I charge you that an admission is a statement or writing by a party which tends to aid the cause of the other party. And all admissions under our law are to be carefully considered. In this case . . . the plaintiff has contended that certain statements in the medical charts constitute admissions, and these admissions, if they appear to be such, should be carefully considered as a statement tending to aid the cause of the side."</div><div class="casepar">Group's objection was that the court charged admissions, then "went on to emphasize that more by stating that if plaintiffs had contended the statements in medical charts were admissions on behalf of Anesthesia Group. I would particularly object to that because there is no evidence and there are no writings in the chart anywhere by Anesthesia Group, an entity.

Group was required to treat all patients at Hospital who required such services; it could not choose. It was required to do so in the four operating rooms for stated hours five days a week, for emergencies, 24 hours a day. Hospital had the right to approve the rates charged through its billing system and in its name. Hospital had a closed anesthesiology panel, in that no other anesthesiologists were allowed to practice there.

When Ms. Hammonds was admitted by her private physician, Dr. Brand, she was presented with an admission form headed "Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Inc."

She had been seen only by a CRNA, the choice of whom had not been given to her. Because she herself was a Licensed Practical Nurse and was in training to become a Registered Nurse, the jury could have found she was aware that a nurse does not practice independently and must be overseen by a physician provided by the hospital, since she had been given no input into selection of personnel. As stated in Richmond County, supra at 509: "[m]ost modern hospitals hold themselves out to the public as providing many health related services including services of physicians. A patient is likely to look to the hospital, not just to a particular doctor he comes into contact with through the hospital."</div><div class="casepar">As to reliance by Ms. Hammonds on Humana, there was no direct evidence of affirmative statements made by her but such reliance is subject to proof by circumstantial evidence.

Hospital's third enumeration urges error in denial of the motion for directed verdict on the ground that the Hospital cannot be liable for acts involving professional judgment of Jimenez. It is presented here also as to Dr. Mahoney, but that was not part of the motion made at trial and will not be considered.</div><div class="casepar">Hospital concedes that a hospital may be liable for the professional judgment of its employees under the apparent agency theory in Brown, supra. Because such a theory was properly submitted to the jury, this enumeration need not be further addressed.</div><div class="casepar">8. At the close of all evidence, Hospital renewed its motion for directed verdict and added a new ground, that of "borrowed servant." It contended that even if Jimenez were Hospital's, he was "borrowed" by Dr. Mahoney when he came in the room, absolving Hospital of liability. Enumerations 4 &amp; 5 allege error in denial of the motion on this ground and the failure to instruct the jury on the issue.</div><div class="casepar">The "borrowed servant" does not apply, given the facts.
