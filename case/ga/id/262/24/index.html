Before Judge Carlisle.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Appellee, Barclays Bank PLC d/b/a Barclays Wholesale Consumer Services ("Barclays"), was granted summary judgment on November 27, 1996, on the multiple theories of liability set forth in the permissive joinder of claims and parties in a complaint by each of the appellants, Simpson Consulting, Inc.; Link Financial Consulting, Inc.; Financial Software Consultants; Comoro Services, Inc.; Monkiewicz Services, Inc.; Logan Computer Associates, Inc.; Datagen, Inc.; SDF &amp; Associates, Inc.; Goforth Consulting, Inc.; Bandy Consulting, Inc.; North East Software Solutions, Inc.; and JHR Consultants, Inc.; each of which had separate and independent claims that were virtually identical except as to the individual damages. Appellants timely filed its notice of appeal, as amended.</div><div class="casepar">The complaint asserts the following theories of liability: (1) fraud; (2) breach of contract (written/oral); (3) federal RICO; (4) Georgia RICO; (5) promissory estoppel; and (6) third-party beneficiary liability.</div><div class="casepar">The complaint fails to set forth the circumstances constituting fraud, which "shall be stated with particularity." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9/index.html">9-11-9</a></span> (b). Appellants contend that statements made by appellee's agents to independent contractors working as its purchasing agents were relied upon by each of the appellants to its detriment and were false, although such statements were never made directly to any appellant or in its presence. None of the appellants entered into written contracts with appellee, even though the work was to be performed over more than 12 months; the parties made no oral contract. However, appellants contend that their agreement was binding, notwithstanding the lack of specificity, definiteness, or formality, due to custom and practice in the trade.</div><div class="casepar">Appellants each entered into separate independent contractor agreements and confidentiality agreements, not with Barclays, but with independent contractors, Scott International Banc Systems, Inc. ("SIBS") and Manley &amp; Associates, Inc. ("M &amp; A"). Barclays had a contract with M &amp; A but not with SIBS; M &amp; A subcontracted such work with SIBS. Patrick E. Manley ("Manley") was president of M &amp; A as well as an officer and shareholder of SIBS. Eric Scott ("Scott") was a vice president of Barclays as well as owner and president of SIBS; Barclays' management and Scott's superiors were unaware of the existence of SIBS; that Scott was president of SIBS; or that SIBS had a contract with M &amp; A to do Barclays work. Such dealings between M &amp; A and SIBS, and Scott's secret relationship and business with each while employed by Barclays, violated Barclays' employment and operations policies. Manley, on behalf of M &amp; A, paid to Scott substantial sums, $15,000 and $60,000, which Scott deposited into his checking account.</div><div class="casepar">Although Scott insisted that each appellant become a separate corporate entity and appellants as corporate entities dealt solely with the independent contractors, M &amp; A and SIBS at all times and never with appellee, appellants assert that each appellant has a direct action against appellee.</div><div class="casepar">Each appellant asserted special damages for unpaid work performed. Appellants also assert that each is entitled to damages for holding itself available for possible future work, but do not state with enforceable particularity the terms, rates, and conditions for such future work. Appellants invoiced the independent contractors for the work done and received checks drawn on the account of SIBS for the invoiced amounts. The checks that appellants received from SIBS were returned for insufficient funds.</div><div class="casepar">Appellants' only enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because material issues of fact as to each theory of liability exist for jury determination. We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, appellee's motion for summary judgment pierced appellants' pleadings on at least one essential element of each theory of liability, thereby requiring appellants to come forward with evidence to create material issues of fact. It must also be remembered that appellants have separate and individual causes of action that may be similar, or even identical, but not a common cause of action or a class action; thus, each appellant as to their respective claim, although treated collectively, must individually show that there exist material issues of fact as to their claim. Appellants collectively and individually have failed to meet this shifted burden of proof. Lau's Corp. v. Haskins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/1/index.html">261 Ga. 491</a></span>, 493-494 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/1/index.html">405 SE2d 474</a></span>) (1991).</div><div class="casepar">1. Fraud.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/6/1/index.html">51-6-1</a></span> codifies an action for common law fraud. The essential elements of fraud and deceit are that: (1) the defendant made the representation; (2) at the time he made the representation, he knew that the representation was false; (3) he made the representation with the intention and purpose of deceiving the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff reasonably relied upon such representation; and (5) the plaintiff sustained loss and damages as the proximate result of the representation.

All that exists in the case sub judice is a business proposal that fell apart prior to it becoming formalized into a legally binding contract.</div><div class="casepar">Appellants misplace reliance upon Robert &amp; Co. Assoc. v. Rhodes-Haverty Partnership, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../690/8/index.html">250 Ga. 680 (300 SE2d 503) (1983)</a></span> and Southeast Consultants v. O'Pry, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/26/index.html">199 Ga. App. 125 (404 SE2d 299) (1991)</a></span>, which are distinguishable on both the law and facts from the case sub judice. Factually in these cases, the tortfeasors prepared written documents as professionals, providing expert opinion and services for a fee, which documents contained erroneous, mistaken, or misleading statements of fact. The tortfeasors negligently gave such documents to another with the full expectation that such documents, unchanged, would be given to and relied upon by the plaintiffs. Liability was premised, not on scienter, but upon negligence in making the representations relied upon as experts upon whom it is reasonably expected that others will rely. "Under this standard [Restatement, Torts Second,  552], one who supplies information during the course of his business, profession, employment, or in any transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest has a duty of reasonable care and competence to parties who rely upon the information in circumstances in which the maker was manifestly aware of the use to which the information was to be put and intended that it be so used. This liability is limited to a foreseeable person or limited class of persons for whom the information was intended, either directly or indirectly. . . . If it can be shown that the representation was made for the purpose of inducing third parties to rely and act upon the reliance, then liability to the third party can attach." Robert &amp; Co. Assoc. v. Rhodes-Haverty Partnership, supra at 681-682.</div><div class="casepar">The foregoing cases are a hybrid "fraud" action, based upon professional negligence, not scienter. Such standard applies under very limited factual circumstances that would give a right of action for professional malpractice, but for the absence of "privity." In the case sub judice, appellee was neither a professional paid to render the oral statement nor was the statement anything other than future expectations, intentions, or opinions as to future circumstances. Therefore, the case sub judice does not come within the ambit of such case law either legally or factually. See Badische Corp. v. Caylor, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/5/index.html">257 Ga. 131</a></span>, 132 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../503/5/index.html">356 SE2d 198</a></span>) (1987); First Nat.

App. 558</a></span>, 559 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../305/54/index.html">442 SE2d 804</a></span>) (1994). Appellants have failed, upon the shifting of the burden of proof on summary judgment after appellee pierced the pleadings, to come forward with evidence to create a material issue of fact.</div><div class="casepar">2. (a) Breach of Contract -- Written.</div><div class="casepar">A written contract must either be an agreement executed by both parties or a series of writings which have been signed by both parties and which show an offer, acceptance, and mutually binding promises as consideration and contain the necessary terms of the contract. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/13/3/1/index.html">13-3-1</a></span>; Bd. of Regents v.

The terms of the contract must be agreed upon unconditionally and be sufficiently definite or ascertainable for enforcement, or the purported agreement has no enforceability as a binding agreement. Green v. Johnston Realty, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../305/89/index.html">212 Ga.

There exists no written contracts signed by each individual appellant and by the appellee; nor does any series of writings signed and agreed upon by appellee and by each individual appellant exist.

Georgia RICO.</div><div class="casepar">The United States Supreme Court has held that the standard of proof in a category of cases "serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision," so that the intermediate standard of proof, clear and convincing evidence, will be used in those cases affecting fundamental rights, stigma, and property rights. Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (99 SC 1804, 60 LE2d 323) (1979); see also In the Matter of Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (90 SC 1068, 25 LE2d 368) (1970). This intermediate standard of "clear and convincing" evidence has been applied where the consequences to the person are significant. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> The United States Supreme Court has not decided the issue as to what standard of proof to use in federal civil RICO cases. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> In civil forfeiture cases under RICO, the criminal standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" has been applied. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> Some federal courts, which does not include the Eleventh Circuit, have applied the lowest civil standard of proof, "preponderance of the evidence" in federal civil RICO cases, based upon reasoning from similar federal statutes. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> "A RICO claim, replete with the ruinous threat of treble damages, can not be assembled by cobbling together plainly inconsistent allegations of fraud." McLaughlin v. Anderson, supra at 191. The United States Supreme Court, when it was called upon to decide whether punitive damages violated due process, considered but did not decide whether or not the standard of proof for imposition of punitive damages should be "clear and convincing" evidence, but held that other procedural safeguards were adequate to protect the person. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Thus, the United States Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit have not determined which civil standard of proof to apply in federal civil RICO. Generally, Georgia courts follow federal decisions interpreting RICO. See Stanton v. Shearson Lehman/American Express, 622 FSupp. 293 (N.D. Ga. 1985). However, the federal and Georgia RICO acts are not identical; the Georgia RICO is both broader in parts and narrower in parts. Where the public policy of Georgia differs, Georgia courts will not follow federal precedent, because Georgia courts are free to afford its residents greater protection than that given by the federal courts.

Margiotta, 811 F2d 698, 731 (2nd Cir. 1987); Armco Indus. Credit Corp. v. SET Warehouse Co., supra at 480-481; United States v. Local 560 of the Intl. Brotherhood &amp;c., 780 F2d 267, 279-281 (3rd Cir. 1985); United States v. Cappetto, 502 F2d 1351, 1357 (7th Cir. 1974). The reasoning was that the RICO Act borrowed language from the Clayton Act, which also imposes triple damages and which applies a preponderance of the evidence standard. However, in regard to a different issue under RICO, the United States Supreme Court held that the use of language from the Clayton Act did not import into RICO all the baggage of interpretation of the Clayton Act. Tafflin v. Levitt, supra. A second rationale was that, at common law, fraud required the standard of proof of "clear and convincing" evidence, but the Supreme Court had not followed such intermediate standard in security fraud cases under the Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934,  10 (b).
