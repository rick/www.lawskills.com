Fulton City Court. Before Judge Jackson.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On March 20, 2000, Robert David Wickham was charged by accusation in the City Court of Atlanta with driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/40/6/391/index.html">40-6-391</a></span> (a) (1); disobeying a traffic control device, in violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/40/6/20/index.html">40-6-20</a></span>; and failing to obtain a Georgia license within 30 days of becoming a resident, in violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/40/5/20/index.html">40-5-20</a></span> (a). Wickham moved to dismiss the charges or, in the alternative, to transfer his case to the State Court of Fulton County, contending that there is no proper constitutional basis for the existence of the City Court of Atlanta. The constitutional challenge to the court was denied, and this Court granted Wickham interlocutory review to address his assertion that the City Court of Atlanta is unconstitutional. For the reasons which follow, we affirm the denial of the constitutional challenge.</div><div class="casepar">Wickham enumerates nine errors by the City Court in denying his challenge; however, Wickham's attack on the constitutionality of the City Court of Atlanta can be summarized as threefold: (1) The City Court, under Ga. L. 1996, p. 627, offends the exclusivity and uniformity provisions of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. I, Pars. I <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> and V; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> alternatively, the enacting provisions of the 1996 Act exceed the bounds of permissible legislation under the 1983 Georgia Constitution, Art. XI, Sec. I, Par. IV, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> and the 1967 <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> and</div><div class="casepar">in existence on June 30, 1983, and administrative agencies shall not be subject to the provisions of this article. The General Assembly shall have the authority to confer "by law" jurisdiction upon municipal courts to try state offenses.</div><div class="casepar">1986 <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> constitutional amendments under which the City Court existed prior to 1996; (2) the City Court's exercise of jurisdiction over traffic misdemeanors cannot be justified on the ground that the City Court is a municipal Court; and (3) inasmuch as the City Court lacks constitutional existence and jurisdiction under the 1983 Georgia Constitution, its exercise of traffic misdemeanor jurisdiction violates due process under the State and Federal Constitutions.</div><div class="casepar">The City Court of Atlanta, under Ga. L. 1996, p. 627, does not violate the exclusivity and uniformity provisions of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. I, Pars. I and V.</div><div class="casepar">It is certainly plain, as Wickham contends, that the 1983 Georgia Constitution provides that the judicial power of the state is to be exercised by "magistrate courts, probate courts, juvenile courts, state courts, superior courts, the Court of Appeals, and Supreme Court." Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I. And that with the exception of certain preexisting courts, state Courts are to have "uniform jurisdiction." 1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. V. However, Par. V. expressly acknowledges the existence of non-uniform courts, stating that the courts of each class are to have uniform jurisdiction "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Constitution." Art. VI, Sec. X, Par. I cites the City Court of Atlanta by name and provides that it, along with other specified courts and administrative agencies having quasi-judicial powers, "shall continue with the same jurisdiction as such courts and agencies have on the effective date of this article until otherwise provided by law." Furthermore, with certain exceptions, those non-uniform</div><div class="casepar">(1) In all misdemeanor cases arising under the Act known as the Georgia State Highway Patrol Act of 1937, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, and all other traffic laws of the State, as the same exist or may hereafter be amended.</div><div class="casepar">(2) In all misdemeanor cases arising under any law of the State regulating the ownership and operation of motor vehicles within its territorial jurisdiction, as the same exists on January 1, 1969, or as may thereafter be extended, and</div><div class="casepar">(3) In all cases arising under any charter provision or ordinance of any such city regulating traffic or the ownership or operation of motor vehicles. . . . Any court or system of courts so established shall not be subject to the rules of uniformity in Paragraph I, Section IX of Article VI of the Constitution of 1945. The General Assembly is authorized to delegate to the governing authorities of any such municipality any and all powers necessary and appropriate for the establishment, operation and maintenance of such court.</div><div class="casepar">courts in existence on June 30, 1983 are not subject to the exclusivity provisions of Article VI. 1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I. Thus, the 1983 Georgia Constitution recognizes the existence of the City Court of Atlanta as a non-uniform city court. See Wojcik v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../399/3/index.html">260 Ga. 260 (392 SE2d 525) (1990)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Yet, Wickham claims that the City Court was undermined by the 1996 Act, Ga. L. 1996, p. 627, because the Act violated the requirements governing the establishment of state courts, in that, the 1996 Act, while purporting to create "a system of state courts," Ga. L. 1996, p. 627,  1, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span> pursuant to Article VI, Sec. I, limited the City Court of Atlanta's subject matter jurisdiction to state laws regarding traffic and "all other crimes and offenses arising out of the same occurrence. . . ." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> Ga. L. 1996, p. 627,  3. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Therefore, he argues, by specifying the court as part of a "system of state courts" yet limiting its jurisdiction, the act is inconsistent with the constitutional requirements for the creation of such courts. But this contention is unavailing.</div><div class="casepar">This Court will not presume that the General Assembly intended to enact an unconstitutional law, and when the language of an act is susceptible of a construction that is constitutional, and another that would be unconstitutional, this Court will apply the meaning or construction which will sustain the act. HCA Health Svcs. v. Roach, <span class="casecite"><a href="../241/8/index.html">265 Ga. 501</a></span>, 503 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../241/8/index.html">458 SE2d 118</a></span>) (1995). This Court too must be mindful of the cardinal rule in construing legislative acts, which is to ascertain the legislative intent. Kemp v. City of Claxton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../122/9/index.html">269 Ga. 173</a></span>, 175 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../122/9/index.html">496 SE2d 712</a></span>) (1998). What is more, the various provisions of the Act should be viewed in harmony and in a manner which will not produce an unreasonable or absurd result. Vollrath v. Collins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../605/index.html">272 Ga. 601</a></span>, 604 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../605/index.html">533 SE2d 57</a></span>) (2000); Barton v. Atkinson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../136/01/index.html">228 Ga. 733</a></span>, 738 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../136/01/index.html">187 SE2d 835</a></span>) (1972). That is why we decline to accept Wickham's premise that the phrase "system of state courts" found in the preamble of the 1996 Act amounts to an unconstitutional attempt by the General Assembly to place the City Court of Atlanta in the class of "state court," under Article VI, Paragraph I, while restricting its jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">Certainly under the 1996 Act, by its terms, the City Court is a court authorized "pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, Section I," Ga. L. 1996,  1, but as has already been discussed, Article VI, Section I, permits certain non-uniform courts in existence on June 30, 1983, as was the City Court of Atlanta. What is more,  1 of the 1996 Act further states that the City Court of Atlanta is to exist under the 1967 and 1986 constitutional amendments which authorized the City Court of Atlanta prior to the 1996 Act. See also Ga. L. 1996, p. 639,  29. Thus, the 1996 Act does not attempt to transform the City Court of Atlanta into the exclusive category of a "state court," but rather continues its existence as a constitutionally sanctioned city court. In fact, the City Court under the 1996 Act has been characterized as a "state-established city court." See Waller v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../251/53/index.html">231 Ga. App. 323</a></span>, 324 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../251/53/index.html">498 SE2d 362</a></span>) (1998); see also City of Lawrenceville v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../245/35/index.html">233 Ga. App. 1 (502 SE2d 794) (1998)</a></span>. The existence of the City Court of Atlanta, pursuant to the 1996 Act, does not offend the exclusivity and uniformity provisions of the 1983 Georgia Constitution.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, the fact that the City Court of Atlanta remains a city court under the 1996 Act refutes Wickham's alternate contention that it is outside the constitutional confines of the 1983 Ga. Const., Art. XI, Sec. I, Par. IV, and the 1967 and 1986 constitutional amendments under which the City Court existed prior to 1996. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Compare Lomax v. Lee, <span class="casecite"><a href="../375/4/index.html">261 Ga. 575</a></span>, 579 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../375/4/index.html">408 SE2d 788</a></span>) (1991). This fact also defeats Wickham's arguments regarding defects in the City Court as a municipal court under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/36/32/1/index.html">36-32-1</a></span>. Although OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/36/32/1/index.html">36-32-1</a></span> (a) refers to the City Court of Atlanta, the City Court is not established pursuant to the statute. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> Rather, it is an entity preserved in the 1983 Georgia Constitution <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> and carried forth in the 1996 Act.</div><div class="casepar">The City Court of Atlanta does not lack constitutional existence; therefore, contrary to Wickham's contention, its exercise of jurisdiction in his case does not run afoul of state or federal due process.</div><div class="casepar">Joseph J.

L. 1996, p. 627,  3 provides:Each court shall have jurisdiction coextensive with the territorial limits of the city in which it is located over:(1) All crimes and offenses under the laws of the state relating to and regulating traffic, and all other crimes and offenses arising out of the same occurrence as such traffic offense, not above the grade of misdemeanor and not exclusively cognizable in the superior courts; provided, however, no defendant shall be tried on a misdemeanor charge in any county except where the alleged offense was committed.(2) All offenses against the duly enacted laws and ordinances of such city relating to and regulating traffic, and all other offenses against laws and ordinances of such city arising out of the same occurrence as such traffic offense. Punishment for such offenses shall be imposed as provided by laws and ordinances duly enacted by the governing authority of such city.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      Our determination also renders meritless Wickham's collateral assertions that inasmuch as the City Court lacks constitutional authorization under the 1996 Act, it has ceased to exist because of a severable repealer provision in the Act, and that the City Court is non-existent because the 1996 Act is a population bill prohibited under 1983 Ga. Const., Art. III, Sec. VI, Par. IV (b). In argument, Wickham also states that certain of the statutory exceptions to the population bill prohibition contained in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../code/ga/28/1/15/index.html">28-1-15</a></span> (c) are unconstitutional. However, it is not a viable issue in this appeal as the lower court did not expressly rule on the constitutionality of that statute, and Wickham does not pursue the claim with supporting legal argument.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;
      Accordingly, there is no merit to Wickham's assertion that if the City Court were treated as a municipal court under the 1996 Act, the Act would be unconstitutional because</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note11" href="#source11">11</a></span>&nbsp;
      References in the 1983 Georgia Constitution to the City Court of Atlanta as a municipal court are descriptive of the geographic scope of the court's jurisdiction as city-wide, and not that it is subject to the statutory provisions for the establishment of municipal courts. See 1983 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I &amp; Art. VI, Sec. X, Par. I (5).</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">William C.
