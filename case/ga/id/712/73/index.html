August 7, 1952.</div><div class="casepresiding">TOWNSEND, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. Where, as here, the evidence for the State is to the effect that the defendant committed an unjustified assault on the prosecutor with a weapon likely to produce death, and the evidence for the defendant is to the effect that he was acting in self-defense under circumstances of justification, it is not error for the trial court to fail without request to charge the law of mutual combat.</div><div class="casepar">2. While the indictment here was for the offense of assault with intent to murder, and did not specifically charge the offense of shooting at another, the latter or lesser offense was nevertheless included in the greater offense charged in the indictment. It was therefore not error for the trial court to charge the jury on the offense of shooting at another and to refer to such crime as "the offense charged."</div><div class="casepar">3. The verdict is supported by the evidence, and, having the approval of the trial court, will not be disturbed by this court.</div><div class="casepar">Walter Robinson was indicted, tried, and convicted in the Superior Court of Bibb County for the offense of assault with intent to murder. The evidence in its view most favorable to support the verdict, as offered by the prosecutor and one other eyewitness, was: that the prosecutor was a policeman and was on duty near a movie house in the City of Macon; that there was a considerable crowd of people buying tickets and entering and leaving the theatre, and he was engaged in keeping the sidewalk clear for traffic; that he instructed the defendant and a group of men with whom he was talking to clear the sidewalk; that the others went on but, when he returned a few minutes later, he found the defendant still blocking the sidewalk; that he again asked him to move to the side so that people could get by; that the defendant replied he would not move, and, as the police officer turned toward him, he pulled a pistol from his shirt and shot twice, hitting the prosecutor once in the hand as the latter was drawing his own weapon; and that he then fired, wounding the defendant twice. The defendant's statement, supported by the testimony of other eyewitnesses, was to the effect that when the prosecutor approached him the second time he hit him in such way that he staggered off the sidewalk and at the same time drew his gun and shot; that not until after he was wounded did the defendant draw his pistol, and that he shot only in self-defense to protect his life. Immediately after the exchange of shots, the defendant ran from the scene, but was located and arrested.</div><div class="casepar">Following his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial on the general grounds, which was later amended by the addition of three special grounds. The overruling of this motion is assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. The first special ground of the amended motion for a new trial assigns error on the failure of the court, without request, to charge on the subject of mutual combat and mutual intention to fight. Where the evidence indicates that the law of mutual combat is essentially for consideration, it is error to fail to charge on this subject, even in the absence of request. Bailey v. State, <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 401</span> (96 S. E. 862); Harris v. State, <span class="casemissing">152 Ga. 199 (2)</span> (108 S. E. 781); Clements v. State, <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 166 (2)</span> (78 S. E. 716).</div><div class="casepar">Johnson v. State, <span class="casemissing">173 Ga. 734 (2)</span> (161 S. E. 590); Green v. State, <span class="casemissing">195 Ga. 759 (3)</span> (25 S. E. 2d, 502); Jarrard v. State, <span class="casemissing">206 Ga. 112 (13)</span> (55 S. E. 2d, 706). The evidence for the State here showed that the defendant drew his gun and shot without provocation, merely on being asked to move out of people's way on the sidewalk. The evidence for the defendant showed that he fired only after the prosecutor had hit him, pulled his pistol, and shot and wounded him, and that in an effort to protect his life he attempted to shoot the weapon from the police officer's hand. Under neither view of the evidence does there appear to be any mutual intention to fight, or any quarrel in the ordinary significance of that word. It follows, therefore, that there was no error in failing to charge on the subject of mutual combat.</div><div class="casepar">3. In charging the jury the judge first instructed them that the defendant was charged with the offense of assault with intent to murder. He again stated, "The charge against this defendant is assault with intent to murder," and set out the ingredients of the offense as: first, an assault; second, its commission with an instrument which, in the manner used, is a weapon likely to kill; third, malice; and, fourth, intent to kill. After discussing the elements of the offense and instructing the jury that, if any one were missing, the defendant would not be guilty of assault with intent to murder, the judge then stated that, if the jury should so find, "you would then look to the evidence and the defendant's statement and determine whether or not he is guilty of the offense of shooting at another," and proceeded to define that offense. He then made the following statements, the italicized portions of which are excepted to in the second and third special grounds: "Now the defendant denies that he committed any unlawful assault whatever on the prosecutor, and says he acted lawfully in self defense. He contends he is not guilty of either offense charged, and further contends that the State has not proved his guilt of either offense as charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Now, if you find the defendant guilty of the charge of shooting at another, as charged in the indictment, then it would be your duty to convict him of that offense." It is contended that the above italicized excerpts from the charge were error harmful to the defendant, in that they caused the jury to believe that he had been indicted and was being tried for two offenses, rather than only one.</div><div class="casepar">The charge has been dealt with at some length to indicate that it fairly instructed the jury with reference to the offenses of which the defendant might be convicted, and that the court twice told the jury that he had been indicted on a charge of assault with intent to murder. As was stated in Haney v. State, <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. App. 396</span>, 399 (13 S. E. 2d, 384), the offenses of assault with intent to murder and shooting at another are "grades [of the same type of crime] which may be embraced in the same general charge or indictment." They are, however, distinct offenses. This being so, a charge of assault with intent to murder must necessarily include a consideration of the charge of shooting at another, for, as pointed out in the Haney case, supra, it must be decided whether the deed was actuated by malice or by passion, or by neither and in self defense. The statement of the court that the offense of shooting at another was charged in the indictment is not literally true, but in the practical sense that the jury must consider both offenses, it was aptly stated, and it is not apparent that such a statement could have misled the jury to the injury of the defendant. These grounds are accordingly without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. The evidence, although conflicting, authorized the verdict. The general grounds of the motion for a new trial are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. Gardner, P.
