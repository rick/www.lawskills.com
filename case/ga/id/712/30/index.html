There is no authority of law for a sheriff or other arresting officer to accept a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail from one charged with violating one of the criminal laws of this State.</div><div class="casepar">(a) When an arresting officer requires or accepts a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail from one charged with violating one of the criminal laws of this State or from one signing the bond as surety for such person, the money remains the property of the person depositing it with such officer, and the officer holds it in trust for the depositor.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Where a sheriff accepts a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail from a surety for one charged with violating one of the criminal laws of this State, and it does not appear that the sheriff and the surety knowingly violated the laws of this State or that the money was deposited by the surety and accepted by the sheriff with criminal intent on their part, the surety is not estopped from maintaining an action to recover the money so deposited.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The act of a sheriff in illegally requiring and accepting a cash bond or a sum of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bond from a surety for one charged with an offense against the laws of this State is an act done colore officii.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The action, having been instructed within 20 years from the alleged breach of the bond, was not barred by the statute of limitations. Furthermore, this action was not barred in that it was brought within 4 years from the date of the dissolution of the garnishment proceeding referred to in the opinion, infra.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Where no contention was made in the court below that the plaintiff had pursued a different remedy, and by reason thereof was barred from maintaining the present action, or that the issues involved in the instant case had already been passed upon in another case between the plaintiff and the defendants or their privies, the contention cannot be raised for the first time on appeal in this court.</div><div class="casepar">(f) The petition set out a cause of action for breach of the official bond of the sheriff, and the trial judge erred in sustaining the demurrers to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">E. E. Washburn brought suit against A. B. Foster, Sheriff of Fulton County, and the surety on his official bond, seeking to recover $10,000, which the plaintiff alleged he had deposited with the sheriff in order to obtain the release of one Fred Martin, who was in the custody of the sheriff on January 5, 1945, to answer a charge of misdemeanor in the Criminal Court of Fulton County. The petition alleges, in substance: that an appearance bond of $15,000 was required by the sheriff as bail for Martin, and he required in addition to an appearance bond, which was duly executed and approved, that $15,000 as s cash bond be turned over to him; that the plaintiff put up with the sheriff a cash bond of $10,000; that Martin appeared in court as required by said bond and was convicted on January 15, 1945, and after his conviction it was necessary for him to make a supersedeas bond, to be approved by the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, in order to secure his release from the custody of the defendant sheriff pending a review of his case by the appellate courts of this State; that the plaintiff and others signed a certiorari or appeal bond for Martin, which was approved by the Clerk of the Superior Court of Polk County on February 1, 1945, and, on February 3, 1945, by the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, who accepted the certiorari bond; that the plaintiff authorized the defendant Foster to pay the $10,000 to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County, and the defendant Foster accepted the assignment and agreed to do so, but he failed to deliver the money to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County and failed to pay the money to the plaintiff; that thereafter, on October 22, 1947, Martin was arrested to serve the sentence imposed and, as a result, the appeal bond was exonerated and became null and void. The prayers of the petition are for process and for judgment against the defendants for $10,000 with interest from the time the money was deposited with the defendant Foster.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants demurred to the petition upon the ground that it failed to set out a cause of action against either of them, and that any claim the plaintiff might have had against them was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial judge sustained these grounds of demurrer, and the plaintiff excepted.</div><div class="casepar"> There is no authority of law for a sheriff or arresting officer to accept a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail from one charged with a criminal offense against the laws of this State; and, when an arresting officer requires or accepts a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail, the money remains the property of the person depositing it with such officer, and the officer holds it in trust for the depositor. Holt v. State, <span class="casemissing">11 Ga. App. 34</span> (74 S. E. 560). Since a sheriff has no authority under the laws of this State to require or accept a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail, it follows that there is no authority of law by which money so deposited could legally be forfeited. In this connection, see Scarboro v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../195/34/index.html">207 Ga. 449</a></span> (62 S. E. 2d, 168). The fact that, under the allegations in the present case, it appears that the arresting officer required a cash bond or a deposit of cash in addition to the regular bond required of the said Martin, does not change the general rule that a sheriff or other arresting officer of this State has no authority to accept a cash bond or a deposit of cash in lieu of bail or in addition to the bail required by law. It appears that the said Martin was charged with a misdemeanor, and, under the law of this State, he was entitled as a matter of law to furnish bail in a reasonable amount with the sureties on the bond to be approved by a sheriff of this State. Code,  27-902. There is no provision of law whereby a sheriff can require such sureties to deposit with him a cash bond or a deposit of money in addition to the bail required by law before he will accept the bail tendered him; and where this is done, the money so deposited remains the property of the person depositing it, and the sheriff holds it as trustee for the depositor.</div><div class="casepar">Of course, if the sheriff has legally paid out the money under a summons of garnishment served upon him or other legal order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or has paid out the money on instructions of the person depositing it with him, this would relieve the sheriff of liability for the amount lawfully paid out by him.</div><div class="casepar">That the plaintiff authorized the sheriff to turn the money over to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County and to the Clerk of the Superior Court as additional security and collateral for a certiorari bond signed by the plaintiff, does not prevent the plaintiff from having the right to recover the money from the sheriff, where it further appears that the sheriff did not turn the money over to the clerk as directed by the plaintiff. While the clerk of the court was authorized to require a proper certiorari bond from the defendant, there is no authority of law for him to require a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of a proper certiorari bond or in addition to the certiorari bond. From the allegations of the petition, it appears that the clerk approved the bond furnished by the plaintiff and others for said Martin, and that the sheriff never turned the money held by him over to the clerk or returned it to the plaintiff. Under the allegations of the petition, the sheriff at the time the suit was instituted held the money sued for as trustee for the plaintiff, who was the legal owner of the same.</div><div class="casepar">While the requirement by the arresting officer, that the said Martin give a cash bond or deposit a sum of money with the sheriff in lieu of bail, was illegal, this does not prevent the plaintiff from recovering the money held by the sheriff as trustee for the plaintiff. It does not appear from the allegations of the petition that the sheriff demanded or extorted the money from the plaintiff as costs, or that he converted such money to his own use, but it clearly appears that he accepted the money from the plaintiff as a cash bond or as a deposit of money as collateral in addition to bail. While his action in accepting the money from the plaintiff was illegal, under the allegations of the petition in this case, "yet his doing so was a mistake of law; and while ignorance of the law is no excuse, yet there can be no offense unless there is a joint union or operation of act and intent; and if the act of the officer in taking the cash bonds [or deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail] was not authorized by law, there certainly seems to have been no criminal intent on his part in doing the act." Holt v. State, <span class="casemissing">11 Ga. App. 34</span>, 37, supra. Although under the allegations of the petition, the acceptance of the deposit of money by the defendant sheriff was without authority of law, we cannot say that the sheriff and the plaintiff knowingly violated the laws of this State or that the money was deposited by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant with criminal intent on their part. Under the allegations of the petition in this case, we cannot say as a matter of law that the facts alleged show such an illegal act, in which the plaintiff is equally culpable or criminal with the defendant sheriff, that the court must refuse to grant the plaintiff any affirmative relief against the sheriff and the surety on his official bond.</div><div class="casepar">The allegations of the petition are sufficient to show that the defendant accepted the money under color of and by virtue of his office as Sheriff of Fulton County, Georgia. "An officer's act colore officii is thus defined: 'An officer's acts are done colore officii when they are of such nature that his official position does not authorize the doing of such acts, though they are done in a form that purports they are done by reason of official duty and by virtue of his office.' Hawkins v. National Surety Co., <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. App. 367</span>, 371 (11 S. E. 2d, 250), and cit. Clearly the sheriff had no right to require a cash bond or a deposit of money in lieu of bail or in addition to bail, and his action in so doing would, as an act colore officii, render him and his sureties liable on his official bond to anyone aggrieved. The action against the sheriff and the surety on his bond arose ex contractu. In this connection, see Copeland v. Dunehoo, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 817</span> (138 S. E. 267); Powell v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <span class="casemissing">45 Ga. App. 88</span> (163 S. E. 239); Cantrell v. National Surety Co., <span class="casemissing">46 Ga. App. 202</span> (167 S. E. 314); Powell v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 529</span> (173 S. E. 196). The statute of limitations on a sheriff's official bond is twenty years, since the bond is under seal and there is no express statute providing for a different period of limitation of actions. Furthermore, this action was brought within four years from the date the garnishment proceeding was dissolved, which proceeding had prevented Sheriff Foster from paying over the money involved to the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Fulton County until the dissolution of said garnishment proceeding, on May 20, 1947.</div><div class="casepar">The contention of the defendants in error that the plaintiff is estopped or barred from maintaining the present action because of a former action brought by him cannot be maintained, since this contention was not raised in the trial court and passed upon by the trial judge. The cases cited and relied upon by the defendants in error are distinguishable on their instant case. in Lankford v. Holton, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 632</span> (51 S. E. 2d, 687), the contention was made in the trial court by the trial judge taking judicial cognizanee of the judgment taken in a previous case. While the cases of Petty v. Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">40 Ga. App. 63</span> (148 S. E. 747), and Griffin v. Augusta &amp; Knoxville R., <span class="casemissing">72 Ga. 423</span>, are to the effect that a court cannot hold facts to be true which are contradicted by legislative acts and records of which it is bound to take judicial notice, they do not authorize a holding in the present case different from the one made. Even if the court should take judicial notice of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly of Georgia, and approved February 25, 1949 (Ga. L. 1949, p. 2127), there is nothing in this resolution to prevent the plaintiff from maintaining the present action. Moreover, this resolution was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Washburn v. MacNeill, <span class="casemissing">205 Ga. 772</span> (55 S. E. 2d, 135). The facts alleged in the present suit are materially different from those set out in the resolution, and the facts and parties defendant in the instant suit are different from those set out in the petitions in Washburn v. MacNeill, supra, and in Washburn v. Thompson, <span class="casemissing">78 Ga. App. 133</span> (50 S. E. 2d, 761). Since there was no plea or contention made in the court below that the plaintiff was barred from maintaining the present action by reason of former actions involving the same cause of action, the contention cannot be raised in this court for the first time. Of course, if the sheriff has legally paid over the money to another under proper orders of court, or, on direction of the plaintiff, has paid the money over to the clerk as collateral on a certiorari bond, or if the plaintiff is barred from maintaining the action because of prior actions involving the same cause of action, these would be matter of defense on the trial of the case; but, in the absence of proper pleas in the court below and a ruling thereon in that court, this court cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot support the allegations of his petition on a trial in the court below.</div><div class="casepar">The trial judge erred in sustaining the general demurrers of the defendants to the petition and in holding that the plaintiff's cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the plaintiff was estopped from denying the illegality of the transaction. The cases cited and relied on by the defendant in error are either from other jurisdictions, and so are not controlling as precedents upon this court, or are distinguishable on their facts from the present case and do not authorize a ruling different from the one herein made.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment revered.
