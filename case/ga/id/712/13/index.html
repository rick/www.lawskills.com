May 8, 1952.</div><div class="casepresiding">WORRILL, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and dismissing the plaintiff's petition.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Vaughn T. Parry sued Davison-Paxon Company in the Superior Court of Richmond County for damages and alleged substantially as follows: The defendant, a corporation, owns and operates many large department stores, and operates in connection with its business, delivery motor trucks, and makes deliveries of goods and merchandise sold at the stores. The plaintiff, on an afternoon between the hours of one and two, had undressed and was asleep in the bedroom in the rear of her home. At that time the plaintiff was awakened by an unusual noise coming from her living-room in the front of her home. The noise continued for some minutes while she was dressing. Upon leaving her bedroom she walked up to the living-room and upon reaching the door of the living-room she saw two large negro men standing within a few feet of her. She realized that the two negro men had forced their entrance into her home, and that their obvious purpose was either to rob her home or commit some grave offense against her person. All of the doors to the plaintiff's home had been locked before she retired. The plaintiff was so frightened, alarmed and upset by the presence of the two negro men, that she fainted and would have fallen to the floor except for the fact that the two negro men thereupon left her home hastily through the front door. The plaintiff had securely locked the front door before she retired, and the two negro men had forced their way through the door by the use of some metal bar, all of which appears from the scraped and torn woodwork on the door and the facing of the door. The two negro men were at the time employees of the defendant, and were driving one of the defendant's trucks to deliver goods sold by the defendant, in the course of and within the scope of their employment. The plaintiff is advised and alleges that the defendant had sold, and its two employees were delivering a small mahogany table to one L. R. Jones or his wife, residing at 2342 Franklin Street. In leaving the plaintiff's home the two employees left the table, which bore a tag which had painted thereon the name and address of the defendant and the name of L. R. Jones and his address. The employees were using the table as a pretext and scheme to vindicate and exculpate them in their unlawful acts in entering the plaintiff's home, in case they happened to be caught and apprehended. The defendant was on said day duly informed of the criminal acts of its employees, and the manager stated that he would promptly take action</div><div class="casepar">against the employees, and that he would see that justice was done. Neither the defendant nor its manager has taken any action, and the two negro men are still retained as employees. The defendant by its non-action is seeking to justify the unlawful acts, in its effort to avoid liability in the case. On the day of the commission of the unlawful acts by the employees, the defendant was fully informed of their conduct, but the defendant has condoned and ratified the unlawful acts. On said date and at the time of employing the two truck drivers, the defendant knew that they were wholly unreliable criminal characters, and that they were likely to commit said acts, or by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence the defendant could have easily ascertained their unreliable character. The defendant was guilty of gross negligence in employing the two truck drivers, and in retaining them, both before and after the commission of the unlawful acts. At the time the defendant's employees forced their way into the plaintiff's home, she was pregnant and in a very delicate condition, and the acts and conduct of the defendant, acting by and through its employees, caused the plaintiff to suffer a complete nervous collapse from which she has never recovered. The plaintiff has suffered, and will continue to suffer great mental torture, which has seriously affected her health and well-being. She is now advised that she may have a miscarriage as the result of the acts and conduct of the defendant, acting by and through its employees. The plaintiff has been damaged by the defendant in the just and full sum of $10,000 and claims exemplary damages in the sum of $2500.</div><div class="casepar">The demurrer was sustained on the general grounds and the petition dismissed. To this judgment the plaintiff excepted.</div><div class="casepar">707; Daniel v. Excelsior Auto Co., <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 621</span>; Atlanta Baseball Co. v. Lawrence, <span class="casemissing">38 Ga. App. 497</span>; Heath v. Atlanta Beer Distributing Co., <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 494</span>; Niebuhr v. Pridgen Brothers Co., <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 668</span>; Plumer v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">58 Ga. App. 622</span>; Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Hudson, supra. The allegations of the petition negate the essential fact necessary to hold the master liable for the tortious acts of the servant, for the allegations clearly show that the assault was not committed in furtherance of the master's business, but, rather, clearly show the affair to be a personal matter between the manager and the plaintiff." "The true test is not whether the tort was committed by reason of anger, malice or ill will, but whether or not it was committed in the prosecution and within the scope of the master's business." Frazier v. Southern Railway Co., <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 590</span>, 593 (37 S. E. 2d, 774). Construing the allegations of the petition most strongly against the pleader, they show that the alleged acts were outside the scope of the employment of the two truck drivers. The petition alleges that the employees unlawfully and criminally forced their way into the plaintiff's home for the purpose of committing an unlawful act, to wit, either to rob the plaintiff or to commit some grave offense against her person. The employees were not acting in furtherance of their master's business, but were acting outside of the scope of their employment, hence the petition does not set forth a cause of action under the doctrine of respondeat superior.</div><div class="casepar">2. "By ratification of a tort committed for one's benefit, the ratifier becomes liable as if he had commanded it; otherwise if the act was done for the benefit of a third person." Code  105-109. Here, the allegations of the petition show that the defendant's two employees had departed from the prosecution of the master's business and begun a separate scheme of their own, from which no benefit could possibly inure to the master. "Where the employee was acting exclusively for himself and was not acting at all for the master, and did not profess to be acting for the employer, the mere retaining of the servant after knowledge of his tort would not constitute ratification binding the master." Reddy-Waldhauer-Maffett Co. v. Spivey, <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. App. 117 (3)</span> (185 S. E. 147). In the same case, on pages 119 and 120, the court held as follows: "He was acting solely for himself and 'there is no such thing as a master assuming, by ratification, liability for an act of another in which the master had no part.' Knight v. Laurens Motor-Car Co., 108 S. C. 179 (93 S. E. 869, L.R.A. 1918B, 151). There can, of course, be no ratification unless the act was done for the master, or at least purported to be done for him.' 39 C. J. 1266,  1448." Accordingly, the petition set forth no cause of action against the defendant on the grounds of condonation and ratification of the acts of the defendant's employees.</div><div class="casepar">4.
