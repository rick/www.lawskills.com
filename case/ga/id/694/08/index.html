M. McKenzie sued Louis Williams and Leslie Williams for rent on a farm in Macon County. The petition alleged that the defendants were the plaintiff's tenants during the year 1953, but, notwithstanding the expiration of the term of the relationship of landlord and tenant, the defendants held possession of the farm for and during the crop year 1954. The sum sued for was $4,500. The defendants demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not set out how the amount of $4,500 was arrived at nor on what it was based. The trial judge overruled the demurrer. The defendants filed a plea of res judicata in which it was alleged that the judgment was rendered on November 6, 1954, in the Superior Court of Macon County in favor of the defendants on the same subject matter and between the same parties as in the present case and that the Superior Court of Macon County had jurisdiction of the matter. The plea alleged that copies of the pleadings, verdict and judgment were attached thereto and that the judgment was an adjudication of the cause.

S. C. S. W. C."</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff demurred to the plea on the grounds: (1) That the plea fails to show facts that the purported former judgment was a bar to the present action. (2) That it does not allege that the former proceedings involved either the same issues of the same cause of action or the same subject matter. (3) That it does not affirmatively show that the matter in judgment was the same matter set forth in the complaint. (4) That it does not constitute a valid defense.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff offered an amendment to the petition. The plaintiff amended his petition by renouncing any claim for double rent and by alleging that his right of recovery was predicated on the obligation of the defendants to pay rent "where the title is shown in the plaintiff and the occupation by the defendants." The defendants demurred to the amendment on the ground that it sought to set up a new cause of action, and filed an answer and cross-bill. The cross-bill claimed that the plaintiff had damaged the defendants in the sum of $8,500 by virtue of the fact that, after having entered into a rental contract for the farm in question by the terms of which the plaintiff rented the same to the defendants for 5 years beginning in 1952, the plaintiff wrongfully swore out a dispossessory warrant against the defendants on January 4, 1954, on the ground that they had failed to pay the rent that was due and were holding over beyond their rental term. The cross-bill related that the dispossessory warrant was tried in Macon Superior Court, and a verdict and judgment rendered in the defendants' favor on November 6, 1954. It set out that by reason of the dispossessory warrant being sued out and on account of the plaintiff's circulating certain false and malicious statements concerning the defendants, their reputation was injured to such an extent that they were hindered in their farming operations in a named sum, and suffered other damages in other specified sums. The cross-bill also alleged that the defendants were entitled to recover a certain sum of the plaintiff as attorney's fees because of a certain distress warrant and the before mentioned dispossessory warrant having been sued out and also by reason of the plaintiff having filed the present suit. The plaintiff demurred to the cross-bill on the ground that it undertook to assert by way of setoff a claim not of similar nature to the demand of the plaintiff sued upon. The demurrer alleged that the liability of the defendants to pay rent was that of tenants holding over but does not state what the defendants contend the nature of the actions set up by the cross-bill was or wherein it was dissimilar in nature to the cause of action set forth in the petition. The plaintiff further demurred to the cross-bill on the ground that it sought to recover attorney's fees and that in the kind of action set up by the cross-bill attorney's fees are not recoverable. The demurrer also attacked the cross-bill on the ground that the matter set up therein was not the proper subject matter of cross-action.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. In this case the plaintiffs in error, Louis Williams and Leslie Williams, will be referred to as the defendants, and the defendant in error, Ed. M. McKenzie, will be referred to as the plaintiff, the parties having occupied those respective positions in the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">The judgments of the trial court which the bill of exceptions brings to this court for review are: The judgment overruling the demurrer to the petition as originally drawn; the judgment allowing the amendment to the petition; the judgment striking the plea of res judicata; and the judgment sustaining the demurrer to the cross-bill.</div><div class="casepar">The demurrer to the petition raised the single question whether its allegations disclosed the basis upon which the plaintiff arrived at the sum of $4,500, the amount he sought to recover. The defendants argue that, in view of the fact that there had been a rental contract for the year 1953, they were entitled to be informed by the petition whether the sum sued for was based upon the rental price fixed by the expired contract or whether it was measured by what the plaintiff considered the occupancy of the premises reasonably worth or whether it represented double the yearly rental value of the farm. There was no intimation in any allegation of the petition that the suit was for double rent. Under the law the amount sued for could not have been fixed by the expired rental contract. Williams v. Bernath, <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. App. 354</span> (6 S. E. 2d 184). So from the averments of the petition it clearly appears that the $4,500 was the sum that the plaintiff thought was reasonable compensation for the occupancy of the farm.</div><div class="casepar">2. The second question presented by the bill of exceptions is whether the amendment to the petition should not have been allowed because it set up a new cause of action. We have construed the petition to set forth a cause of action for the occupancy of rented premises after the expiration of the rental contract. The amendment undertook to set up in lieu of the cause originally declared on a cause upon an implied contract to pay rent. The gravamen of the first cause as set up in the petition was the wrongful occupancy of another's property, while the essence of the second action alleged in the amendment was the occupancy of property with the implied consent of its owner. The first action sounded in tort, the second was a suit upon a contract. The conclusion is inescapable that the amendment set up a new cause of action, and was erroneously allowed.</div><div class="casepar">While the plaintiff in the first instance could have waived the tort, treated the defendants as his tenants and sued upon their implied obligation to pay him rent if he had so elected ( Ridgway v. Bryant, <span class="casemissing">8 Ga. App. 564</span>, 70 S. E. 28; Code  105-105), he did not choose that option, and having once sued in tort, the action could not thereafter be changed to a suit on the implied contract. Beard v. Beard, <span class="casemissing">197 Ga. 487 (2)</span> (29 S. E. 2d 595).</div><div class="casepar">It has been held that where the petition is ambiguous in that it does not definitely disclose whether the cause asserted is ex contractu or ex delicto, it will ordinarily be construed as sounding in tort. Aiken v. Southern Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">118 Ga. 118</span>, 120 (44 S. E. 828, 62 L.R.A. 666, 98 Am. St. R. 107). It is well established that where the nature of the cause declared upon does not clearly appear from the petition, it will be construed as will best serve the interest of the pleader. Payton v. Gulf Life Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">4 Ga. App. 762 (2)</span> (62 S. E. 469); Southern Express Co. v. Pope, <span class="casemissing">5 Ga. App. 689 (2)</span> (63 S. E. 809). We mention the foregoing rules because they are relied on by counsel. Neither of them is applicable to the facts of this case.</div><div class="casepar">3. In Cooledge v. Casey, <span class="casemissing">58 Ga. App. 134</span>, 137 (198 S. E. 96), this court held: "An assignment of error on a judgment striking an answer can not be made in a bill of exceptions assigning error on a judgment overruling a general demurrer to a petition. Wright v. Morris, <span class="casemissing">50 Ga. App. 196 (3)</span> (77 S. E. 365)." It follows that the assignment of error on the striking of the plea of res adjudicata cannot in this case be made in the bill of exceptions assigning error on the judgment overruling the general demurrer to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">4. In White v. Chisolm, <span class="casemissing">160 Ga. 177</span> (127 S. E. 140) it is stated: "The judgment of the court below sustaining the demurrer of the plaintiff to the counter-petition or cross-action filed by the defendant can not be reviewed by direct bill of exceptions prior to the final disposition of the plaintiff's case in the court below. Knights of The Klu Klux Klan v. Terrell, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 374</span> (116 S. E. 793); Bellinger v. Eblin, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 657</span> (124 S. E. 137)." There being no final disposition of the present case, the assignment of error on the sustaining of the plaintiff's demurrer to the cross-bill is premature, and this court is without jurisdiction to pass upon it at this time.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.
