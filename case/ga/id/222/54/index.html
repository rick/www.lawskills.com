Because we find no merit in these enumerations of error, we affirm.</div><div class="casepar">1. The record does not support O'Brien's argument that the evidence is insufficient <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> to support the DUI conviction. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> On appeal the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, and O'Brien no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> Viewed in that light, she State's evidence was as follows.</div><div class="casepar">At 4:00 a.m. on October 6, 1994, Officer Smail of the City of Atlanta Police Department saw a car turn onto Roswell Road and weave back and forth twice across two lanes, before abruptly stopping, signaling, and making a left turn. The officer stopped the car and asked the driver, O'Brien, for her driver's license. Officer Smail noticed a strong odor of alcohol on O'Brien's breath and had difficulty understanding her speech. O'Brien used the car door to pull herself out of her vehicle. Upon Officer Smail's request, O'Brien agreed to participate in a field sobriety test, which the officer had been trained to administer.</div><div class="casepar">Officer Smail administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus ("HGN") test to O'Brien. Before administering the HGN test, the officer asked O'Brien if she was on any medication, and she said no. During the HGN test, the officer observed the tracking of O'Brien's eyes as they followed a stimulus passing back and forth before her face. In the opinion of Officer Smail, the HGN test indicated that O'Brien was impaired. Smail then prepared to administer a "nine step walk and turn" test and asked O'Brien if she had any injuries that might affect her balance. O'Brien informed the officer that she had a spinal injury. Without performing any additional field sobriety tests, the officer, believing O'Brien to be less safe to drive, placed her under arrest for DUI. At trial, O'Brien admitted to having consumed four beers.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence is sufficient to authorize a rational trier of fact to find O'Brien guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of DUI. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">2. In her second enumeration of error, O'Brien contends that her motion for new trial should have been granted due to ineffective assistance of counsel.</div><div class="casepar">In order to establish ineffectiveness of trial counsel under Strickland v. Washington, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> O'Brien must show both that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Furthermore,</div><div class="casepar">In her brief, O'Brien includes an almost endless list of complaints against her trial counsel, including complaints that he: (1) failed to call a doctor as a witness to document her spinal injury; (2) failed to call a doctor to confirm that O'Brien was hypoglycemic; (3) failed to ensure the admission of O'Brien's medical records into evidence by subpoenaing the doctors responsible for generating the medical reports; (4) failed to make a motion to compel discovery; (5) failed to obtain discovery of the police videotape in advance of trial; (6) maintained a demeanor at trial that was aggravating to the court and the jury; (7) struck juror Abner by mistake, rather than juror Adams and (8) made numerous improper statements in his opening and closing statements to the jury.</div><div class="casepar">We have reviewed the record and find that, other than as discussed below with respect to juror Adams, we agree with the trial court's finding that counsel's performance was not deficient. Counsel's failure to subpoena medical doctors is understandable, because no experts had been retained by O'Brien. She was not willing to pay for a doctor to testify. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> The expert "from Tennessee" dismissed by counsel had apparently been retained only for an earlier court date. In any case, we do not know whether these unnamed doctors, who did not testify at the hearing on motion for new trial, would have helped O'Brien's case. O'Brien argues that counsel should have compelled discovery to ascertain the exact charges against her but fails to show any surprise or prejudice. Discovery of the police videotape was impossible, because there was no tape. Counsel's demeanor at trial was aggressive and perhaps occasionally patronizing, but this was a matter of style within the bounds of reasonable behavior. Counsel's opening and closing statements, viewed as a whole, are consistent with a reasonable trial strategy.</div><div class="casepar">After the jury was selected, trial counsel admitted to making a mistake in striking juror Abner rather than juror Adams, who neither drinks nor drives. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> This was not a mistake in judgment, but rather a matter of misidentification, or "flip-flopping," of the jurors' names. Although we cannot say that no reasonable attorney would have allowed juror Adams to remain on the jury, juror Adams remained on this jury due only to confusion on the part of trial counsel and not as a matter of strategy. Considering, however, that juror Adams was not openly prejudiced against O'Brien and that the evidence supports the verdict, we cannot say that but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. O'Brien contends that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by commenting on her right to remain silent following the traffic stop in which she was cited for DUI. As part of her defense, O'Brien maintained she was using medication which may have caused her to seem impaired. In her closing argument, the prosecutor stated "the first we heard about the drugs is today." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span> This comment, O'Brien suggests, is a prosecutorial comment on her right to remain silent and is not allowed because such a statement is more prejudicial than probative. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span></div><div class="casepar">O'Brien did not object to the prosecutor's statement at trial or otherwise preserve this issue for appellate review. As this is a court for the correction of error of law, we will not consider any issues raised on appeal that were not raised and preserved in the trial court. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span> Even if O'Brien had preserved this issue for appeal, it would not warrant reversal. The evidence shows that O'Brien responded negatively when the arresting officer asked her if she was on any medication. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> Thus, the comment by the prosecutor was a comment on the evidence and was not a comment on her silence.</div><div class="casepar">Joseph J.

      O'Brien was convicted on June 8, 1995. Her initial motion for new trial was dismissed on September 18, 1995, because her attorney failed to appear in court. O'Brien filed a notice of appeal on October 2, 1995. By our order of April 1, 1996, the case was remanded to the trial court to allow the filing of a motion for new trial and an evidentiary hearing on O'Brien's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied O'Brien's motion for new trial on May 14, 1996. O'Brien filed a notice of appeal on June 12, 1996. After a considerable delay, the appeal was received by this court on May 20, 1999.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      O'Brien did not question the sufficiency of the evidence in the hearing on her motion for new trial, which was limited by our order of April 1, 1996, to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, because we are not certain that O'Brien had a reasonable opportunity to raise this claim earlier, we will consider this enumeration of error.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
