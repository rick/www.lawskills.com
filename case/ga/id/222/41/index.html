Before Judge Flournoy.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">We have consolidated these five interrelated criminal appeals. Viewed to support the jury's verdict, Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979), the facts are these:</div><div class="casepar">On the evening of November 25, 1996, Derrick Andre Crawford arrived at his home, parked his Land Rover beside his Ford Explorer in the attached garage, exited the vehicle, and headed toward the kitchen door. The three Rottweiler dogs in his fenced back yard began barking as Damon Jason McCall, Antonio York, Bernard Mathis, and Antonio Hill drove up in a Nissan Pathfinder. Leaving the motor running, the four jumped our of the Pathfinder and ran toward Crawford. They were wearing dark ski masks, and all four had guns. They forced Crawford into his kitchen. Crawford's wife, Shunda Green, was in the kitchen; a stove burner was on, and a "strange" smell was in the air. When Green saw the armed men, she and her two small children began screaming. In the resulting chaos, Green quickly called 911 and left the telephone line dangling open, as McCall herded Crawford, Green, and the children into the living room.</div><div class="casepar">The 911 operator relayed to patrol officers all pertinent information regarding a robbery in progress, and police officers began to arrive on the scene. Meanwhile, inside the house, there was general chaos, which included a great deal of yelling, demands for money, and demands to know "where the stuff was at." Crawford repeatedly refused to tell the men where the money and "the stuff" were, so McCall shot Crawford. Crawford then gave McCall the information he wanted, and McCall was apprehended shortly afterwards attempting to flee in Crawford's Land Rover with a kilo brick (1,000 grams) of powder cocaine wrapped in brown paper with a horseshoe logo on it. The Smith &amp; Wesson .380 caliber pistol that McCall used to shoot Crawford was lying beside the kilo on the front seat of the Land Rover. McCall had a significant quantity of blood on his shoes and pants; he also had Crawford's wallet in his pants pocket, as well as nine "hits" of crack cocaine.</div><div class="casepar">When York, Hill, and Mathis realized the police had arrived, panic set in. They demanded to know a way out of the house. They forced Crawford, Green, and the children into the basement and tried to exit the basement door. However, simultaneously, the police approached the basement door and forced it open. Green shouted "They shot him. They shot him," as the police burst in. York, Hill, and Mathis tried to run back up the basement steps. York made it up the stairs and was apprehended in the living room; Hill was stopped mid-stairs; and Mathis was apprehended before he could reach the stairs. After Mathis was handcuffed, he told the arresting officer, "You boys are going to get medals for this. This is the biggest drug bust. There's three keys in the house upstairs."</div><div class="casepar">In his statement to the police, McCall admitted shooting Crawford but claimed it was in self-defense. He claimed that Crawford invited him into the house to discuss a prior business deal, and they began to argue; that he shot Crawford because he thought Crawford was reaching for a weapon and he "felt in fear of [his] life"; that he shot Crawford with a gun he fortuitously discovered in the pillows of Crawford's couch; that, "after the little shoot," Crawford started giving him items, like his wallet and the hits of cocaine found in McCall's pants pocket; and that he was "not in a clear frame of mind," so he just took the items Crawford voluntarily gave to him. McCall stated that there was no armed robbery; that York, Hill, and Mathis had nothing to do with anything that occurred; and that the police should "ask my friends they didn't have nothing to do with this."</div><div class="casepar">Crawford and Green, along with McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis, were indicted for two separate counts of trafficking in cocaine based on the plastic bag of cocaine found in the kitchen cabinet and the kilo brick of cocaine recovered from the Land Rover. In addition, McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis were each charged with one count of armed robbery, two counts of aggravated assault, and three counts of burglary. McCall also faced one count of possession of cocaine for the nine hits of crack cocaine recovered from his pants pocket.</div><div class="casepar">A Cobb County jury found Crawford and Green guilty on both counts of trafficking in cocaine; they found McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis not guilty on both counts of trafficking in cocaine. The jury found McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis guilty as charged on all remaining counts of the indictment. The five men appeal from their convictions. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. We find the evidence sufficient for a rational trier of fact to have found appellants guilty of the offenses for which they were convicted. Jackson v. Virginia, supra.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Despite claims of "mere presence," Crawford's trial testimony, as well as other State's evidence, showed that York, Hill, and Mathis each had guns, wore ski masks, and aided McCall in the burglary, armed robbery, and aggravated assaults of Crawford and Green. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/2/20/index.html">16-2-20</a></span> (parties to a crime); Burks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../158/2/index.html">268 Ga. 504</a></span>, 505 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../158/2/index.html">491 SE2d 368</a></span>) (1997). Crawford's testimony further showed that the men were not "invited" into the residence, contrary to their assertions on appeal.</div><div class="casepar">(b) We also reject Crawford's contention that no evidence linked him to the drugs found in the Land Rover and the kitchen. It was reasonable for the jury to determine that the kilo in the Land Rover was removed by McCall from Crawford's home without permission; likewise the 57.3 grams of cocaine were found in Crawford's kitchen cabinet. An inference can be made that the cocaine in Crawford's home belonged to him. Carthern v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../233/94/index.html">238 Ga. App. 670</a></span>, 672 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../233/94/index.html">519 SE2d 490</a></span>) (1999). The jury apparently made that inference, and that was their prerogative.</div><div class="casepar">2. Appellants raise various Bruton <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> issues. As per Bruton, a defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is violated when: (a) co-defendants are tried jointly; (b) one co-defendant's statement is used to implicate the other co-defendant in the crime; and (c) the co-defendant who made the implicating statement employs his Fifth Amendment right not to testify and thus does not take the stand to face cross-examination about the statement. McDonald v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/35/index.html">210 Ga. App. 689</a></span>, 690 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/35/index.html">436 SE2d 811</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">Recognizing the above as law, we cannot help but question the tactical wisdom of the State in joining together for trial interrelated Cases A and B, when the result is to make the victim in Case A a co-defendant in Case B. If the victim/co-defendant does not testify because of Fifth Amendment concerns arising from Case B, the State may be left to prove Case A though the victim/co-defendant's pretrial statements and identification. Under Hanifa v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../139/2/index.html">269 Ga. 797</a></span>, 800 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../139/2/index.html">505 SE2d 731</a></span>) (1998), a Bruton Confrontation Clause violation may be inevitable since cross-examination of the victim/co-defendant is impossible.</div><div class="casepar">In the face of a potential Bruton violation, the issue then becomes: (1) whether the implicating statement falls within a "firmly rooted" exception to the hearsay rule that will allow its admission, despite Confrontation Clause issues; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> (2) whether the statement was sufficiently redacted with the use of general terms which do not "obviously refer directly to someone"; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> or (3) whether any Bruton violation can be considered harmless. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> With these principles in mind we turn to the specifics of appellants' Bruton allegations.</div><div class="casepar">(a) McCall asserts a Bruton violation in the admission of co-defendant York's statement identifying McCall as the shooter.</div><div class="casepar">Co-defendant York gave a statement to the police that there was no armed robbery or burglary; that Crawford invited the men inside his house to discuss business between him and McCall; that no one, including McCall, was carrying a gun when they entered the house; that McCall and Crawford began arguing; that McCall shot Crawford; that he did not know why McCall shot Crawford; and that he, York, did not have any idea what was going on at the residence. York also told the interviewing officer that McCall wanted to talk to him in order to exonerate York, Hill, and Mathis.</div><div class="casepar">Thereafter, McCall gave a statement to the police which exonerated York, Hill, and Mathis; confirmed exactly what York said; and added details that raised his self-defense claim with regard to his shooting of Crawford. The evidence also showed that McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis were together in the holding cell at the jail for a long period of time. It was there that McCall told York and the others that he would tell the police that he was responsible for the shooting and that "my friends they didn't have nothing to do with this." Neither McCall nor York testified at trial, but their statements were introduced.</div><div class="casepar">The introduction of York's statement naming McCall as the shooter was a Bruton violation because: York could not be cross-examined about the statement; the statement was not redacted with general terms in order to remove reference to any particular person; and the statement had no independent basis for admission. Hanifa v. State, supra; Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185 (118 SC 1151, 140 LE2d 294) (1998); Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U. S. 116 (119 SC 1887, 144 LE2d 117) (1999). However, we conclude that such violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. McCall's confession was not only "interlocking," but a mirror image of York's statement; McCall unequivocally claimed responsibility for the shooting, albeit in self-defense, and denied that any armed robbery had occurred or that he and his friends were in any way culpable of any crime. Moreover, McCall was apprehended on the scene; his shoes were covered in blood; and he had been in possession of the weapon used to shoot Crawford. Crawford made an in-court identification of McCall as the one who shot him. "[York's] statement did not implicate [McCall] in the crimes more than this other evidence. Accordingly, we find that the admission of the statement was harmless error. [Cits.]" Rooks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../232/56/index.html">238 Ga. App. 177</a></span>, 181 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../232/56/index.html">518 SE2d 179</a></span>) (1999).</div><div class="casepar">(b) At the time of the incident, the lead investigator asked Green what happened. There, on the scene, she told the officer that three masked men had forced their way into her home, demanded money and "the stuff," and shot her husband. She did not know who the men were and did not identify any person as being a perpetrator of the crime.</div><div class="casepar">We find no Bruton issues with regard to Green's statement. "The court could have properly allowed the investigating officer to testify about what the victim told him when he arrived at the scene of the incident under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule." Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/83/index.html">226 Ga. App. 608</a></span>, 609 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/83/index.html">487 SE2d 89</a></span>) (1997). Res gestae is a "firmly rooted" exception to the hearsay rule and thus provides an independent basis for the admission of Green's statement. Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../335/89/index.html">202 Ga. App. 82</a></span>, 84 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../335/89/index.html">413 SE2d 256</a></span>) (1991); Lilly v. Virginia, 119 SC at 1894. In addition, since Green did not know who committed the crimes and named no names, her statement raises no Bruton concerns as to any one of the appellants. No Bruton violation occurs unless the nontestifying co-defendant's statement, standing alone, clearly implicates a defendant. Owen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../206/0/index.html">266 Ga. 312</a></span>, 314 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../206/0/index.html">467 SE2d 325</a></span>) (1996).</div><div class="casepar">(c) Likewise, Green's excited utterance "They shot him. They shot him," had an independent basis for admission. She made that statement as the police came through the basement door. As such, the statement was res gestae. Lilly v. Virginia, supra. In addition, since Green did not know who the intruders were and named no one, her statement, standing alone, implicates no one. Owen v. State, supra at 314 (4).</div><div class="casepar">(d) Co-defendant Mathis made a spontaneous statement as the arresting officer picked him up from the basement floor that "[y]ou boys are going to get medals for this. This is the biggest drug bust. There's three keys in the house upstairs." Crawford contends that the statement implicated him in violation of Bruton. We disagree. The statement, spontaneously made on the scene at the time of arrest, was res gestae and thus admissible. Lilly v. Virginia, supra; Williams v. State, supra at 84. Further, Mathis' statement made no mention about to whom the drugs belonged or how they got into the house. The statement did not name Crawford or imply that Crawford knew about the drugs. Standing alone, Mathis' statement implicated no one. Again, "[t]here is no Bruton violation unless the non-testifying co-defendant's statement, standing alone, clearly implicates the defendant." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Adams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/45/index.html">231 Ga. App. 279</a></span>, 288 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../251/45/index.html">499 SE2d 105</a></span>) (1998).</div><div class="casepar">(e) We will not consider Mathis' Bruton challenge to the admission of his own statement. The rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment are personal. See, e.g., Stevens v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../779/3/index.html">247 Ga. 698</a></span>, 704 (7) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../779/3/index.html">278 SE2d 398</a></span>) (1981). Mathis may not invoke the Sixth Amendment confrontation rights of others to challenge the admissibility of his own statement. Id.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the admission of his pretrial statement was not a Bruton violation. McDonald v. State, supra at 691.</div><div class="casepar">3. For several reasons, appellants claim error in the trial court's denial of their joint motion to sever. On review, we find no error.</div><div class="casepar">The severance of a co-defendant's trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Its decision will not be disturbed unless there is an abuse of that discretion. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/4/index.html">17-8-4</a></span>; Dixon v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/7/index.html">268 Ga. 81</a></span>, 83 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../145/7/index.html">485 SE2d 480</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">A defendant desiring severance has the burden of demonstrating more than the possibility that a separate trial would provide him a better chance of acquittal. He must make a clear showing of prejudice and a consequent denial of due process in the absence of severance.</div><div class="casepar">(Citation omitted.) Berry v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../190/2/index.html">267 Ga. 605</a></span>, 611 (9) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../190/2/index.html">481 SE2d 203</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">(a) Appellants contend that the failure to sever requires reversal because Crawford's status as a co-defendant rendered them unable to impeach him with his prior drug conviction.</div><div class="casepar">(i) It does not appear that this issue was raised as a basis for appellants' pretrial severance motion, presumably because, at the time, it was unknown whether any co-defendant would testify. And, after Crawford took the stand, appellants do not direct our attention to any place in the record where they renewed their motion to sever in order to raise this issue and secure the trial court's ruling thereon.

Moreover, to prove that Crawford was a convicted drug dealer would have been of "questionable value" to appellants in defending against charges that they invaded Crawford's home to steal drugs and money and where the evidence showed that they had removed a kilo of cocaine from Crawford's home. See Thomas v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../346/97/index.html">199 Ga.

Further, the State's evidence clearly established that Crawford was a drug dealer, as reflected by the jury's verdict. Thus, the prior drug conviction would have added little to further impugn Crawford's already tattered general character. Under these circumstances, we conclude that appellants have failed to make "a showing of clear prejudice that is required to warrant a severance, with the result that the trial court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant[s] a separate trial. [Cit.]" Ledbetter v. State, <span class="casemissing">202 Ga.

But the evidence was that all of the perpetrators, including Hill, had guns. And a corresponding number of guns were found discarded in places throughout the house where the perpetrators, including Hill, had been. Accordingly, this contention presents no basis for finding the trial court abused its discretion in denying severance.</div><div class="casepar">(c) McCall contends that his co-defendants presented "antagonistic defenses." However, his co-defendants presented no defense, other than (1) reliance on their own pretrial assertions that there was no armed robbery and (2) reliance on McCall's pretrial statement that the co-defendants had nothing to do with the shooting. Since McCall also claimed there was no armed robbery and voluntarily took responsibility for the shooting, albeit in self-defense, the defenses were not "antagonistic."</div><div class="casepar">(d) Crawford contends there was no "common scheme" between his trafficking charges and the acts of McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis so as to warrant joinder of the offenses for trial. However, pretermitting the factual validity of this argument, "common scheme" is not the only rationale for joinder and, thus, not the only rationale for denying severance. "The trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a severance motion where evidence of one charge would be admissible in the trial of the other." Hunter v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../236/72/index.html">237 Ga. App. 803</a></span>, 804-805 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../236/72/index.html">517 SE2d 534</a></span>) (1999). In that regard, evidence that Crawford kept large quantities of cocaine in his home went to the motive for the other co-defendants' armed invasion of that home and the subsequent shooting of Crawford. Such evidence showing motive is relevant and admissible. Coker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/98/index.html">207 Ga. App. 482</a></span>, 483 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/98/index.html">428 SE2d 578</a></span>) (1993). Likewise, the police investigation of the acts of McCall, York, Hill, and Mathis explains the way in which Crawford was arrested for the trafficking offenses and is, thus, admissible: "Testimony of the arresting officer with reference to the legal investigation and circumstances surrounding the arrest is authorized as original evidence under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/2/index.html">24-3-2</a></span>."

Since Crawford's offenses would have been admissible upon the trial of the other co-defendants' offenses, and vice versa, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance. Dennis v.

However, Crawford does not direct our attention to any place in the record where he raised this issue as a basis for severance. Accordingly, this issue is waived on appeal. Pattman v. State, supra at 786.</div><div class="casepar">Further, even if preserved, the admission of McCall's statement does not show harm requiring severance. The statement was redacted to remove any reference to Crawford and McCall's "business" as involving narcotics. From McCall's statement, standing alone, Crawford and McCall's argument could have been over a money loan. Moreover, by its verdict, the jury clearly did not believe those portions of McCall's statement claiming self-defense, including assertions that Crawford reached for a gun to shoot McCall; that Crawford had a bad temper; that Crawford might have killed him; and that McCall feared for his life. Accordingly, even if such assertions incidentally placed Crawford's character at issue, the jury's rejection of them renders their admission harmless.</div><div class="casepar">(f) Our decision in Division 1, makes it unnecessary to consider appellants' claims that Bruton violations warranted severance.</div><div class="casepar">4.
