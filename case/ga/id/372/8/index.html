She now appeals from an adverse judgment in which the trial court, after a bench trial, found that appellant had not proved the existence of a common-law marriage by a preponderance of the evidence, and that appellant was not an heir at law of the decedent.</div><div class="casepar">The undisputed evidence shows that the decedent entered into a ceremonial marriage in 1960 with one of the appellees. Appellant met the decedent in 1987 and thereafter engaged in a sexual relationship with him. The decedent's wife divorced him in August 1988, after which appellant and the decedent lived together in the decedent's lake home. In September 1989, the decedent was hospitalized. He and</div><div class="casepar">The Declarations of Condominium as amended, the assignments of record and the warranty deed from the original grantor of the condominium units and of the parking garage to the [parking lot owners] created an easement that runs with the land in favor of all the condominium unit owners. Such easement gives only unit owners a right to park in the existing spaces and requires that one space be available for each unit. The right to an assigned space cannot be permanently lost, forfeited or assigned away. Any unit owner or new owner who lacks a parking space upon tender of the appropriate monthly rate must be given a space. . . . The purpose of such parking easement is to guarantee availability of one space per unit throughout the existence of the condominium. . . .</div><div class="casepar">While the actual use of the parking spaces on an individual basis is governed by a license, collectively all present and future condominium owners have a right to one assigned space per unit as an easement right that runs with the condominium unit ownership as well as the land of the [parking lot owners]. . . .</div><div class="casepar">his ex-wife entered into a ceremonial marriage in his hospital room on October 19, 1989, the same day the decedent executed the will subsequently probated. The decedent died two months later.</div><div class="casepar">1. Appellant maintains that she and the decedent entered into a common-law marriage after the decedent's divorce from his wife, and that the common-law marriage rendered the decedent incapable of remarrying his former wife. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/3/2/index.html">19-3-2</a></span> (3). Relying on OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/3/2/index.html">19-3-2</a></span> (3) and case law interpreting it, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> appellant contends that the trial court erroneously placed upon her the burden of proving the validity of her common-law marriage instead of requiring appellees to prove that the common-law marriage had been dissolved by divorce.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's position presupposes the existence of a common-law marriage between her and the decedent. In order for appellees to have the burden of proving dissolution of a former marriage of the decedent by divorce, a former marriage had to be established. Where, as here, the relationship between the appellant and the decedent began illicitly, appellant had the burden of showing that the illicit relationship ended and that she and the decedent had entered into a marriage contract. Brown v. Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">234 Ga. 300</a></span>, 302 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/14/index.html">215 SE2d 671</a></span>) (1975). Appellant attempted to carry this burden by presenting evidence that she and the decedent had entered into a common-law marriage. Whether such a marriage existed is generally a question for the factfinder (Clark v. Cassidy, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. 407</span>, 411 (1879); Kickasola v. Jim Wallace Oil Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../550/97/index.html">144 Ga. App. 758 (1) (242 SE2d 483) (1978)</a></span>), and the party asserting the existence of the common-law marriage must establish its existence by a preponderance of the evidence. Appellant had to establish the existence of the common-law marriage before appellees had to prove its dissolution pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/3/2/index.html">19-3-2</a></span> (3); therefore, the trial court did not err in placing the initial burden of proof upon appellant.</div><div class="casepar">2. Having determined that appellant had not established the existence of a common-law marriage between her and the decedent, the trial court did not err in failing to apply OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/53/2/8/index.html">53-2-8</a></span> inasmuch as appellant was not an heir at law of the decedent.</div><div class="casepar">3. Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant appellant's motion to disqualify the attorney representing the decedent's widow. Relying on Standard 69 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> appellant sought the disqualification on the ground that the attorney had previously represented appellant in two divorce actions stemming from common-law marriages.</div><div class="casepar">In Tilley v. King, <span class="casemissing">190 Ga. 421</span>, 425 (<span class="casemissing">9 SE2d 670</span>) (1940), this court concluded that</div><div class="casepar">[t]he rule must of necessity be that if an attorney has been employed in a matter and has appeared in court in connection therewith, he can not thereafter accept employment and appear in a case against his former client, where under the latter employment he must necessarily assume a position contrary to that involved in his former employment.</div><div class="casepar">The burden is upon the party seeking disqualification to show that the matters embraced within the pending suit are substantially related to the matters or cause of action wherein the attorney previously represented the party. Summerlin v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../427/76/index.html">176 Ga. App. 336 (1) (335 SE2d 879) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In the case at bar, appellant did nothing more than assert that the attorney's prior representation of her involved "matters with issues substantially similar to those presented in the present action." In the absence of any evidence supporting the bare assertion, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to disqualify. See Stoddard v. Bd. of Tax Assessors, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../438/33/index.html">173 Ga. App. 467 (1) (326 SE2d 827) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">WELTNER, Justice, concurring.</div><div class="casepar">This court once again encounters the vexatious doctrine of common law marriage. I concur in the judgment, but write to reiterate an earlier suggestion: that the quantum of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of common law marriage ought to be enlarged.</div><div class="casepar">There should be, in my opinion, but two instances which enlightened policy can recognize as adequate to carry this burden.</div><div class="casepar">This first is -- obviously -- proof of a ceremonial marriage in substantial accord with the requirements of statute law.</div><div class="casepar">The second is the birth of a child or children to the parties.

Grandison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/5/index.html">260 Ga. 6 (389 SE2d 746) (1990)</a></span>, the writer attached to a dissent an appendix that recited:</div><div class="casepar">Following our case of Johnson v. Green, [cit.] our court has been presented with seemingly infinite variations upon the theme of common law marriage. We discuss these here in order to demonstrate the chaos and confusion that pertain, of necessity, when the legal status of marriage -- wrapped as it is in emotion, and cloaked in a plethora of property rights -- is beclouded by so unruly a doctrine as that of common law marriage. [Id. at 12.]</div><div class="casepar">The appendix outlined 33 such "infinite variations." Ridley was decided March 9, 1990 -- only 18 months ago.
