The superior court which reviewed the decision of the administrative agency upheld the constitutionality of the statute against appellants' contentions that it violated their constitutionally-protected freedom of speech and was a denial of due process and equal protection.

' [Cits.]" Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.

Insurance companies have been hog-tied in their efforts to fight insurance fraud (which you pay for) by legislation that so severely penalizes their honest efforts that our industry doesn't dare do its job of resisting fraudulent claims.</div><div class="casepar">In such a mess, rates go up and it doesn't matter who is Commissioner of Insurance.</div><div class="casepar">While we don't always agree with him, our present Insurance Commissioner, Warren Evans, is an honest man trying to do a good job. We know he will continue to try to convince the Legislature (as he did in 1989 and 1990) to overcome the influence of the Plaintiff's Bar, unscrupulous medical practitioners and others who profit at your expense, and to reduce your insurance rates the proper way -- by reducing costs.</div><div class="casepar">We support and hope you will vote for Warren Evans for Insurance Commissioner August 7th.</div><div class="casepar">SOUTHERN GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY expenditures is constitutionally permissible, we must determine whether the restriction burdens the exercise of political speech and, if so, whether the statute is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Id.</div><div class="casepar">2. Since OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b)'s prohibition against Southern making a campaign contribution to the Commissioner of Insurance or a candidate for that office does burden expressive activity, and is "intimately related to the process of governing," the State must justify the burden by establishing a compelling state interest. First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 786 (98 SC 1407, 55 LE2d 707) (1978). The State asserts that the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption through campaign contributions is a legitimate and compelling governmental interest that permits the absolute prohibition of campaign contributions from a regulated entity to the regulator or a candidate for the office of regulator. See Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, supra at 1397. We agree. The General Assembly enacted the "Ethics in Government Act" "in furtherance of [the State's] responsibility to protect the integrity of the democratic process and to ensure fair elections. . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/2/index.html">21-5-2</a></span>. The State, through its legislative branch, has a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of the democratic process by forbidding a regulated entity from contributing to the holder of the office which oversees the regulation of the entity, or a candidate for that office.</div><div class="casepar">3. The next issue for determination is whether the legislative infringement on freedom of speech which is supported by a compelling state interest is narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest. The General Assembly believed that the democratic process was threatened when a regulated entity was permitted to contribute to the campaign of one seeking the office of regulator. Prohibiting contributions by the regulated entity to anyone holding or seeking to hold that office eliminates the threat perceived by the legislature. Inasmuch as the regulated entity is free to contribute to all other political campaigns, we conclude that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) is narrowly tailored to meet the threat to the democratic process perceived by the General Assembly.</div><div class="casepar">4. Southern also contends that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) permits an unconstitutional deprivation of property rights without due process. Southern argues that if it and Gwinn are not permitted to provide the voting public with information they alone possess regarding the capabilities of a candidate for the office of insurance commissioner, they run the risk that the voters might elect an insurance commissioner who would initiate policies adversely affecting appellants' business interests. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) does not prohibit a Southern employee, who is not acting on behalf of the corporation, from contributing to the campaign of anyone seeking the office of insurance commissioner; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) does not prevent the dissemination of information by Southern, as long as the dissemination is not done for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of an individual to the office of insurance commissioner, or encouraging the current commissioner to seek reelection. Thus, enforcement of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) does not work the danger to due process that appellants foresee.</div><div class="casepar">We conclude that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) is not an unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of speech as guaranteed by the constitutions of the United States and Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">BENHAM, Justice, concurring specially.</div><div class="casepar">While I agree with the majority's insightful analysis of the constitutionality of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span>, I write separately in order to closely scrutinize the statute and measure appellants' actions against it. Upon review of the statutory scheme, I conclude that appellants' actions did not violate OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b).</div><div class="casepar">The State Ethics Commission was authorized to assess a fine for violation of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b) (see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/6/index.html">21-5-6</a></span> (14)), and did impose a fine of $250 on each appellant after finding they had violated the law. Inasmuch as the law does not favor forfeitures and penalties, we must strictly construe the statute. Bowen v. Griffith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../467/1/index.html">258 Ga. 162 (6) (366 SE2d 293) (1988)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">There is no question that Gwinn was acting on behalf of Southern General, an insurer, when he placed the newspaper ad. The question is whether the placement of the ad constituted a forbidden "contribution," as that term is defined in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (a) (2).</div><div class="casepar">In construing the statute, I am mindful that the cardinal rule is to ascertain the legislative intent and purpose in enacting the statute, and then give that construction which will effectuate the legislative intent and purpose. City of Calhoun v. N. Ga. EMC, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/99/index.html">233 Ga. 759 (1) (213 SE2d 596) (1975)</a></span>. The passage of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> and its subsequent amendment to include all elected constitutional officers in the executive branch (Ga. L. 1992, p. 1075; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (a) (3)) evinces a legislative intent to do away with the possibility that a regulated entity might make campaign contributions in an effort to have influence with the elected official by whom it is regulated. The legislature also stated that the act in which the statute is found was passed in furtherance of the State's responsibility "to protect the integrity of the democratic process and to ensure fair elections for constitutional offices. . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/2/index.html">21-5-2</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">If there is a conflict between different sections of the same statute, the court has the duty to reconcile the conflicting parts so as to make them consistent and harmonious with one another, and to give a sensible and intelligent effect to each part. Houston v. Lowes of Savannah, <span class="casemissing">235 Ga. 201</span>, 203 (<span class="casemissing">219 SE2d 115</span>) (1975); Williams v. Bear's Den, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/69/index.html">214 Ga. 240</a></span>, 242 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/69/index.html">104 SE2d 230</a></span>) (1958). This task must be done without "reading out" any part of the statute as "mere surplusage," unless there is a clear reason for doing so. Porter v. Food Giant, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../351/56/index.html">198 Ga. App. 736 (1) (402 SE2d 766) (1991)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The statutory definition of "contribution" consists of two sentences: the first sentence covers</div><div class="casepar">anything of value conveyed or transferred for the purpose of influencing the nomination . . . or election of an individual to the office of Commissioner of Insurance or encouraging the holder of such office to seek reelection.</div><div class="casepar">The second sentence defines "contribution" as including</div><div class="casepar">the payment of a qualifying fee for and on behalf of a candidate for the office . . . and any other payment or purchase made for and on behalf of the holder of the office . . . or on behalf of a candidate for that office when such payment or purchase is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination . . . or election of the candidate and is made pursuant to the request or authority of the holder of such office, the candidate, the campaign committee of the candidate, or any other agent of the holder of such office or the candidate.</div><div class="casepar">The first sentence prohibits the transfer or conveyance of anything of value to influence the election of a certain person as insurance commissioner, without limiting to whom or what the transfer or conveyance is prohibited. The second sentence forbids payments or purchases made on behalf of the commissioner or candidate to influence the election when that purchase or payment is made pursuant to the request or authority of the commissioner, candidate, campaign committee, or other agent. Thus, the first sentence covers a broad spectrum of conduct: a regulated entity may not transfer or convey anything of value to anyone in an effort to influence the election of a certain person as insurance commissioner. However, the second sentence immediately narrows the scope of the first sentence by prohibiting a regulated entity from making a payment or purchase to a third party on behalf of the candidate for something that will influence the election when the candidate or someone acting for the candidate requests or authorizes the payment or purchase. The necessary corollary to the inclusion of the second sentence is that a payment or purchase made by a regulated entity to a third party on behalf of a candidate but without the request or authorization of the candidate is permissible. This, however, conflicts with the broad coverage contained in the first sentence. Recalling the perceived legislative intent and in order to give effect to both sentences of the definition and to harmonize them with one another without concluding that one is mere surplusage, I must construe the first sentence as prohibiting anything of value conveyed or transferred to the commissioner, the candidate, or their campaign committees.</div><div class="casepar">The State Ethics Commission determined that Southern General's placement of the ad constituted a prohibited contribution in that it was "for the benefit of the campaign of Commissioner Evans. . . ." However, the phrase "for the benefit of" nowhere appears in the statutory definition of "contribution." Assuming that "for the benefit of" is synonymous with "on behalf of," a phrase that is contained within the second sentence of the statutory definition, Southern General's action would not constitute a violation because there is no evidence that Southern's ad was placed pursuant to the request or authority of the commissioner, his campaign committee, or any other agent. Southern General's act does not fall within the purview of my construction of the first sentence since the insurer did not transfer or convey anything of value to the commissioner or his campaign committee.</div><div class="casepar">Since appellants' act of placing a newspaper ad urging the reelection of the insurance commissioner did not violate OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span> (b), I believe the State Ethics Commission erred when it concluded that appellants' act had violated OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/5/30.1/index.html">21-5-30.1</a></span>. Because appellants have never contested the finding that they were guilty of violating the statute, I concur with the majority's affirmance of the judgment of the superior court.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Justice Hunstein joins in this special concurrence.</div><div class="casepar">Jenkins &amp; Eels, Frank E.
