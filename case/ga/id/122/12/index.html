Cherokee Superior Court. Before Judge Burtz.</div><div class="casepresiding">INGRAM, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This appeal is from a judgment of Cherokee Superior Court, in an action brought by the appellant, Plantation Land Company, against appellee, T. B. Bradshaw seeking specific performance of an alleged contract for the sale of realty between Plantation as purchaser and Bradshaw as seller. Plantation appeals the trial court's judgment which granted Bradshaw's motions for judgment on the pleadings, for summary judgment and motions to dismiss and which denied Plantation's motion for summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">I.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant has raised several issues for decision, but we need only consider the main issue of whether the contract for sale of the realty is too vague and indefinite to sustain a claim for specific performance.</div><div class="casepar">The description of the property in the contract was as follows: "[a] certain tract or parcel of land consisting of approximately 1650 acres and being in land lots . . . of the 15th District, Second Section of Cherokee County, Georgia, and being more particularly described on Exhibit 'A' annexed hereto and by this reference made a part hereof, said described property, as the same may be amended by the description from the survey to be obtained as provided herein, together with all improvements situated thereon and all rights, easements and appurtenances now or hereafter belonging thereto, herein called 'property,' excluding however, the residential dwelling occupied by the seller together with a tract of property not exceeding 10 acres selected by seller."</div><div class="casepar">Exhibit "A" of the contract restated the land lots involved saying they were "more particularly shown on a drawing made for T. B. Bradshaw prepared by Lat Ridgeway, dated May 16, 1960, less seller's residence and not more than 10 acres of property to be selected by seller. A copy of said drawing being attached hereto and the property being outlined in red thereon, less and except parcels which have been sold out of the 'Setser' tract described in Exhibit 'A-2' hereto."</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 2 of the contract calls for a future survey (within 70 days of execution) to be made and agreed upon by both purchaser and seller, or to be determined pursuant to the provisions of that paragraph. Paragraph 2 concludes as follows: "The description from the final survey shall have removed therefrom the residential dwelling house of Seller together with not more than 10 acres thereon as may be designated by seller subject to the approval of purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld."</div><div class="casepar">Paragraph 3 sets out the terms regarding the purchase price: "The purchase price of property shall be the product of $1,110 per acre times the number of acres established by the survey hereinabove referred to (excluding seller's dwelling house and lot) . . ."</div><div class="casepar">Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the sales contract provide that the seller, Bradshaw, would lease back most of the land subject to the sales contract except for 10 acres of land and his residence. The seller is to remain in the residence and live there for a given period of time and, under certain conditions, Plantation has an option to purchase Bradshaw's house and the 10 acres.</div><div class="casepar">The thrust of appellant's argument is that the original contract, with the plat attached, provides the necessary "key" for identification and description of the subject property. Appellant urges that all the necessary elements of a contract are contained in the present agreement. The subject matter is approximately 1,650 acres that is described in the contract and shown on a plat. The price is $1,110 per acre. A survey is to be made by the purchaser to determine the exact number of acres involved in the sale.</div><div class="casepar">II.</div><div class="casepar">Specific performance of a contract for the sale of land will not be granted unless the land is clearly identified. Smith v. Georgia Industrial Realty Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/62/index.html">215 Ga. 431 (2) (111 SE2d 37) (1959)</a></span>. A decree for specific performance operates as a deed. Code Ann.  81A-170. Therefore, the decree should contain a description as definite as that required to support a deed. In Laurens County Board of Education v. Stanley, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 389 (200 SE 294) (1938)</span>, it was held that a provision for a subsequent survey could not cure an indefinite description in a deed. In that case, plaintiff sued to enjoin the board of education from moving a schoolhouse and cutting timber from certain land claimed by the plaintiff under a deed conveying property as follows: "Ten acres of land which is hereafter to be surveyed, leaving said schoolhouse in the center . . . being parts of two lots of land (No.) 93 and (No.) 94 of adjoining land of John W. Smith and others." The court held that this was not an adequate description. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Even by combining all of the descriptive elements recited in the present contract, including the referenced plat, it is not possible to locate the exact boundaries of the land sought to be conveyed, nor does the description provide a "key" which can be explained or applied so as to provide a precise description of the property.</div><div class="casepar">III.</div><div class="casepar">We also agree the trial court was correct in deciding that the description of the 10 acres of land to be excepted from the contract, but subject to the option to purchase, is legally insufficient. It must be borne in mind that Plantation has no obligation to exercise this option and if it is not exercised the land referred to in the option would never pass to Plantation. The description of the 10 acres, as provided in the option to purchase paragraph, is to be determined with reference to the provisions of the leaseback which in turn referred to the survey provided for in Paragraph 2 of the contract. Appellant, therefore, contends that the "key" to the certainty of the 10 acres was provided by (1) the survey to be made and (2) the fact that the seller was authorized to determine the shape of the 10 acres around his dwelling house. Appellant argues that any discrepancy with regard to the description of the 10-acre exception was obviated because at the proper time under the terms of the sales contract, Plantation would acquire all the land under the leaseback and could acquire the excluded land under the option. Thus, appellant strongly contends there can be no question as to what land was eventually to pass to Plantation because Plantation would have become owner of the land subject to the leaseback and could acquire the excluded land which was subject to an option. We do not agree, as the option created no obligation to purchase and the description of the property described therein is inadequate.</div><div class="casepar">The land excluded from the sale, but subject to the option to purchase, was described in the contract variously as "Residential Dwelling occupied by seller together with a tract of property not exceeding 10 acres selected by seller" (Par. 1), "10-acre tract and the residential dwelling house located thereon" (Par. 6), "residential dwelling and the up to 10 acres removed from the property." (Par. 6).</div><div class="casepar">Appellant cites numerous cases supporting the principle that land may be effectively described by reference to the home-place of an individual. See Penta Investments v. Robertson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../128/60/index.html">230 Ga. 401 (197 SE2d 358) (1973)</a></span>; Follendore v. Follendore, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 359 (35 SE 676)</span>; Reeves v. Whittle, <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 408</span>, 409 (<span class="casemissing">153 SE 53</span>, 72 ALR 405).</div><div class="casepar">IV.</div><div class="casepar">A clear and definite description of the land to be sold is necessary for the contract to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. Code Ann.  20-401 (4); Smith v. Wilkinson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../192/58/index.html">208 Ga. 489 (67 SE2d 698) (1951)</a></span>. The contract, in the instant case, as executed, gives no definite indication of the size, shape or location of the "up to 10 acres" exception. In the cases of Williams v. Manchester Building Supply Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../176/19/index.html">213 Ga. 99 (97 SE2d 129) (1957)</a></span>, and Smith v. Wilkinson, supra, contracts for the sale of certain land, with exceptions for the vendor's residence and surrounding property which were to be selected later, were held unenforceable for vagueness and for lack of a written description sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.</div><div class="casepar">Contracts which adequately describe the land to be sold are enforceable, even though they rely on subsequent surveys to determine the exact acreage involved in the sale. However, in order to meet the legal requirement for a definite description in writing, the key relied upon must be sufficient to provide identification by reference to extrinsic evidence which exists at the time that the contract is entered into by the parties. Laurens County Board of Education v. Stanley, <span class="casemissing">187 Ga. 389</span>, 390 (<span class="casemissing">200 SE 294</span>) (1938). If the provision relied upon as a key is dependent on future acts or on extrinsic evidence not in existence at the time the contract is executed, it is insufficient. See Brown v. Mitchell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../142/96/index.html">225 Ga. 115</a></span>, 117 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../142/96/index.html">166 SE2d 571</a></span>) (1969).</div><div class="casepar">V.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court's judgment that the contract here involved is legally insufficient for enforcement through specific performance is affirmed.</div><div class="casepar">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="casenotes"><div class="header">

      The subsequent survey included property in certain land lots which were not named in the legal description in the contract, nor included in the original drawing. Also, certain portions of other land lots included in the original drawing were deleted from the final description as provided by the survey.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      The court stated: "We are of the opinion that the deed in the instant case furnishes no key for the identification of the land intended to be conveyed, within the meaning of that term as used in the rules last stated. Such terms refer to a state of facts or circumstances existing at the time the deed is executed, and not to what may be the future intention of the grantor as may be expressed by acts or circumstances not already in existence at the time of the execution of the deed. Insofar as the identity of the land attempted to be conveyed is concerned, the key must lead to the establishment and the location of boundaries as of the time of the execution of the conveyance. A survey to be made in the future does not do so. It cannot be said that a party intended to convey a certain tract of land when the deed shows on its face that the tract of land had not then any definite location or boundaries."
