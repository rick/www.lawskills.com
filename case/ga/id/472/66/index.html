Worth Superior Court. Before Judge Crosby.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Tifton Federal Savings and Loan Association, appellee, filed a petition for a writ of possession to recover a mobile home in which it held a security interest. Appellee was the assignee of a Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement which had been executed by Mrs. Bozeman, appellant, and the dealer from whom she purchased the mobile home. Appellant filed an answer to appellee's petition and denied appellee's allegation that she was in default under the contract. Appellant's denial of default was based on an assertion that the finance charge imposed both by the contract itself and by appellee's acceleration upon her alleged default exceeded the rate allowed by the Georgia Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (MVSFA), Code Ann.  96-1001 et seq. Accordingly, appellant contended that the finance charge was uncollectable and that she was not in default because at the time the debt was accelerated, she had already paid more than she was legally obligated to pay. Appellant also filed a counterclaim seeking to invoke the penalty set forth in Code Ann.  96-1008 (c) for the wilful violation of MVSFA. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, appellee's motion being directed toward the entire case and appellant's motion going only to the main action. The trial court denied appellant's motion for summary judgment and granted appellee's, awarding it a writ of possession. Appellant appeals from the trial court's orders.</div><div class="casepar">However, appellee urges that any violation of MVSFA was cured when it subsequently amended its petition for writ of possession to demand a reduced accelerated balance correctly computed by rebating the unearned finance charge on a pro rata or proportional basis. Appellant contends that appellee could not cure its violation of Code Ann.  96-1004 by amendment of its petition.</div><div class="casepar">The Supreme Court of this state has addressed this issue in a case arising under the Retail Installment and Home Solicitation Sales Act (RIHSSA), Code Ann.  96-901 et seq. Following the buyer's default, the plaintiff-seller in Bell v. Loosier of Albany, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/43/index.html">237 Ga. 585 (229 SE2d 374) (1976)</a></span> brought suit for an accelerated amount computed under the Rule of 78. The seller later amended its complaint to deduct the unearned finance charges from the amount which it sought to recover. See Bell v. Loosier of Albany, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../573/59/index.html">137 Ga. App. 50</a></span>, 51-52 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../573/59/index.html">222 SE2d 839</a></span>) (1975). The Supreme Court held that "acceleration by the seller plus the filing of a complaint against the buyer which sought recovery of unearned and therefore excessive rates amounted to a 'charge' by the seller that violated the [RIHSSA]." Bell, 237 Ga. at 586, supra. The seller's amendment of the complaint was ineffective to correct the violation, as the impermissible "charge" had already been imposed. Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/43/index.html">237 Ga. 585</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">We see no basis upon which to distinguish between RIHSSA and MVSFA for purposes of applying the holding in Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/43/index.html">237 Ga. 585</a></span>, supra, in the instant case. The two statutes were enacted on the same day, both "to provide requirements and prohibitions as to retail installment contracts" and "to provide for finance charge limitation." Ga. L. 1967, pp. 659, 674. While provisions of each act limiting the rates of finance charges differ somewhat in wording, these differences are insignificant in that the provisions are virtually identical in meaning and function. RIHSSA provides at Code Ann.  96-903 (d) (2) that "a minimum time price differential not in excess of the following amounts may be charged . . .," whereas MVSFA states at Code Ann.  96-1004, that "the finance charge . . . shall not exceed the following rates . . ." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">We hold, therefore, that appellee's acceleration under the contract, followed by the filing of its petition for writ of possession "seeking recovery of the balance due, without deducting therefrom unearned rates that would have been earned except for acceleration, amounted to a 'charge' by the seller in violation of" MVSFA. Bell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/43/index.html">237 Ga. 585</a></span>, supra. See also Harrison v. Goodyear Svc. Stores, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../574/05/index.html">137 Ga. App. 223</a></span>, 224-225 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../574/05/index.html">223 SE2d 261</a></span>) (1976).</div><div class="casepar">2. Appellee contends that a 1980 amendment of MVSFA, Ga. L. 1980, pp. 523, 525, (Code Ann.  96-1005), authorized its computation of the accelerated amount due by using the Rule of 78. The 1980 enactment essentially provides that in cases where the buyer pays a retail installment contract debt in full at any time before maturity, he is entitled to receive a refund credit for such anticipation of payments calculated under the Rule of 78. The statute also contains the following proviso: "[T]his section shall not apply to credit upon anticipation of payments or upon acceleration in those cases where the seller or holder of the contract has computed finance charges according to the actuarial method . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) It is appellee's position that the above emphasized language of the proviso, rendering the statute inapplicable in cases of acceleration of contracts containing finance charges computed according to the actuarial method, should be construed as authority to compute the rebate in accordance with the Rule of 78 where, as in the instant case, there has been an acceleration of a contract containing a finance charge computed other than according to the actuarial basis. " 'It is well established that an exception in a statute amounts to an affirmation of the application of its provisions to all other cases not excepted, and excludes all other exceptions.' [Cits.]" Barnett v. D. O. Martin Co., <span class="casemissing">191 Ga. 11</span>, 14 (<span class="casemissing">11 SE2d 210</span>) (1940). Appellee's argument in this regard would perhaps be more availing were it not for the fact that, in its material and relevant parts, all that is contained in the 1980 statute which precedes the proviso is essentially a reenactment of Ga. L. 1967, pp. 674, 680, former Code Ann.  96-1005. The language of that former statute, retained for the most part in the 1980 enactment, was judicially construed in Cook v. First Nat. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../597/03/index.html">130 Ga. App. 587 (2)</a></span> supra, as strictly authorizing calculation of the rebate using the Rule of 78 only in cases of prepayment before maturity, not in cases of acceleration. Under these circumstances, the proviso of the 1980 statute cannot be construed as authority to calculate the rebate using the Rule of 78 in all cases of acceleration of a contract under the MVSFA other than those containing a finance charge computed according to the actuarial method. " 'From the addition of words it may be presumed that the legislature intended some change in the existing law; but it is also presumed that the legislature did not intend to effect a greater change than is clearly apparent either by express declaration or by necessary implication. [Cit.]' [Cits.]" C. W. Matthews Contracting Co. v. Capital Ford Truck Sales, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../530/68/index.html">149 Ga. App. 354</a></span>, 356 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../530/68/index.html">254 SE2d 426</a></span>) (1979). "Words and phrases, the meaning of which has been ascertained in a Statute, are, when used in a subsequent Statute, or in subsequent parts of the same Statute, to be understood in the same sense. [Cits.]" Lane v. Morris, <span class="casemissing">10 Ga. 162</span>, 173 (1851). " 'It is presumed that the legislature knows and enacts statutes with reference to the existing law,</div><div class="casepar">including the decisions of the courts, and when there is nothing in the enactment to indicate that the words used were to have a new and different meaning they should be construed as having the same meaning that was attached to them before the enactment. [Cits.] When we apply this rule of statutory construction we must conclude that if the legislature had intended to enlarge the meaning of [former Code Ann.  96-1005] it would have used other or further language in the [1980] Act [presently existing Code Ann.  96-1005] and it is now for the legislature rather than the courts to change the meaning that that [statute] had at the time of the Act.' [Cit.]" Chilivis v. Cleveland Elec. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../558/67/index.html">142 Ga. App. 751</a></span>, 753-754 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../558/67/index.html">236 SE2d 872</a></span>) (1977). Accordingly, in cases of acceleration of MVSFA contracts, we hold that under the 1980 statute, as with former Code Ann.  96-1005, the refund credit may not be calculated under the Rule of 78. Cook, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../597/03/index.html">130 Ga. App. 587</a></span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">3. The determination that the appellee violated Code Ann.  96-1004 triggers the penalty provision of Code Ann.  96-1008: "A violation of section 96-1004 by the seller or holder shall bar recovery of any finance charge, delinquency or collection charge on the contract." The entire finance charge was therefore forfeited. Kelly v. Sylvan Motors, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../489/11/index.html">160 Ga. App. 420 (287 SE2d 359) (1981)</a></span>; Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Spann, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../517/46/index.html">153 Ga. App. 535</a></span>, 537 (<span class="casemissing">265 SE 2d</span> 863) (1980); Smith v. Society Nat. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../553/11/index.html">143 Ga. App. 370</a></span>, 371 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../553/11/index.html">238 SE2d 739</a></span>) (1977); Cook v. First Nat. Bank, 130 Ga. App. at 588, supra. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other grounds under which appellant contends that the finance charge was excessive.</div><div class="casepar">4. Appellant takes the position that because she was not legally obligated to pay the finance charge she was not in default. "The total finance charge specified in the contract was [$17,051.32]. The total of payments was [$34,816.32]. After deducting the [$17,051.32] finance charge, the total due becomes [$17,765.00]. At the time of acceleration, appell[ant] had paid [$8,674.30], thus reducing the balance to [$9,090.70]. However, at that point, there were [100] months remaining on the contract, or [100] payments of [$241.78] each, for a total of [$24,178.00]. Thus, at the time of acceleration, the future payments due under the contract exceeded the amount of the remaining indebtedness. Under these circumstances, the debtor cannot be held in default." Ford Motor Credit Co., 153 Ga. App. at 538, supra (citing Smith v. Society Nat. Bank, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../553/11/index.html">143 Ga. App. 370</a></span>, supra, and Harrison v. Goodyear Svc. Stores, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../574/05/index.html">137 Ga. App. 223 (223 SE2d 261) (1976)</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for appellee as to the entire case and in denying appellant's motion for summary judgment as to the main action. Accordingly, the judgments are reversed and the case is returned to the trial court where, after the entry of orders consistent with the holding in this case, the appellant's counterclaim will be pending.</div><div class="casepar">Norman Jewel Crowe, Jr., for appellee.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">W.
