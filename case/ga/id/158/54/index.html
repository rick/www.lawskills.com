Coffee Superior Court. Before Judge Hodges.</div><div class="casepresiding">HEAD, Presiding Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The allegations and prayers of the petition were sufficient to invoke the equitable jurisdiction of the court.</div><div class="casepar">2. The trial judge properly overruled the general demurrers to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">W. S. Conner and L. J. Christopher, Jr., as owners of described lands, and Tom T. Fellows, Charles S. Martin, and Mrs. Wynona C. Forbes, as warrantors of the title of the lands owned by the other named petitioners, filed their petition against W. C. Todd in Coffee Superior Court. The petition described the lands which Conner and Christopher allege that they own, and it is alleged that: On January 1, 1956, Tom T. Fellows owned both tracts of land and on that date executed a deed to secure debt to W. C. Todd, together with a promissory note in the sum of $6,500, which deed is duly recorded in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Coffee County. The note secured by the deed from Fellows to Todd has been fully paid. The security deed was recorded on May 18, 1956. The defendant signed an order of cancellation on or about February 26, 1957, which was entered upon the records on February 26, 1957, by Julian Minchew, Clerk of the Superior Court of Coffee County, the order of cancellation reading as follows: "The debt which this instrument was given to secure having been paid in full this instrument is hereby canceled and the Clerk of the Superior Court of Coffee County, Georgia, is hereby authorized and directed to mark it satisfied of record. This 15th day of May, 1956. W. C. Todd." Todd has instituted an action on the note, which is pending in the Superior Court of Troup County, wherein it is alleged by Todd that the court in Troup County has jurisdiction of the defendant, Tom T. Fellows, which allegation Fellows denies. Todd now claims that the order of cancellation on the deed to secure debt is a forgery and that his note and security deed are paramount to the title of W. S. Conner and L. J. Christopher. An actual controversy exists between the parties regarding the title to the lands and title should be declared by a proper judgment of Coffee Superior Court. No final order should be taken in the case pending in Troup Superior Court between W. C. Todd and Tom T. Fellows until the matter is finally adjudicated as to all parties now before Coffee Superior Court and not before the court in Troup County. The note and security deed, having been fully paid, should be surrendered and declared paid and satisfied. The defendant should be restrained and enjoined from prosecuting the action in Troup Superior Court. This is a proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment by virtue of the provisions of the Declaratory Judgments Act of 1945. W. S. Conner now desires to sell the property owned by him and has a purchaser for it, but the purchaser refuses to consummate the sale on account of the controversy existing between the petitioners and the defendant. The issues of fact raised by the petition should be submitted to a jury.</div><div class="casepar">The prayers were: for process; that the defendant be restrained and enjoined from prosecuting the case pending in Troup Superior Court upon the note of Tom T. Fellows to W. C. Todd; that the defendant be required to show cause why he should not be enjoined from further prosecution of the case in Troup County; that the court enter a judgment declaring that the note from Fellows to Todd has been paid, that the security deed securing payment thereof has been properly canceled of record, and that title to the property described therein is in no way affected by the deed to secure debt; and for other relief.</div><div class="casepar">By amendment it was alleged that Todd now claims to hold another security deed against the property involved, dated in 1950, executed by Tom Fellows. The cancellation thereof is asserted by Todd as a forgery, as evidenced by a letter from W. C. Todd, dated February 3, 1962, addressed to J. E. Crabb, of Douglas, Georgia, with a copy to W. S. Conner, a copy of the letter being attached and marked Exhibit 1. The letter from W. C. Todd to J. E. Crabb described in the amendment is headed Broxton, Georgia, and is as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"I notice you ad in the Progress of the Tom Fellows House on Walker and Gaskin for sale.</div><div class="casepar">"This is to inform you that I hold a deed to secure debt and note on this property in the amount of $6,500 plus interest from 1956. Even tho [sic] the security deed has been removed from record, it was done through forgery on some one's part and is no fault of mine or my paper and does not lessen it's [sic] value.</div><div class="casepar">"Also I hold another security deed on the same property dated in 1950 from Tom Fellows to me which is in the same shape. </div><div class="casepar">Yours very truly </div><div class="casepar">[Signed] W. C. Todd </div><div class="casepar">cc to Mr. W. S. Conner </div><div class="casepar">Douglas, Ga."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant's general demurrers to the petition were overruled, and the defendant excepts to this judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. It is the duty of this court to consider its jurisdiction in all cases. Dade County v. State of Georgia, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 241 (39 SE2d 473)</span>. A petition seeking a declaratory judgment is not per se an equitable action (Felton v. Chandler, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 347</span>, <span class="casemissing">39 SE2d 654</span>), and such petition is not converted into an equitable action merely because the court may grant a temporary restraining order to "maintain the status" pending an adjudication with "respect to rights, status and other legal relations." Ga. L. 1945, pp. 137, 139, as amended, (Code Ann. Supp.  110-1102, 110-1111). Georgia Cas. &amp;c. Co. v. Turner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../193/74/index.html">208 Ga. 782 (69 SE2d 771)</a></span>; Ulmer v. State Highway Dept., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../186/88/index.html">210 Ga. 513 (81 SE2d 514)</a></span>; U. S. Casualty Co. v. Ga. Southern &amp; Florida R. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../180/77/index.html">212 Ga. 569 (94 SE2d 422)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">This court is not bound by the name or characterization given an action by the petitioner. In the present case the petitioners seek by judgment of the superior court to have terminated and set at rest the contentions of the defendant that a deed to secure debt executed to him by one of the petitioners has not been properly canceled and that the entry of cancellation is a forgery. The allegations of the petition, and the prayers for a judgment declaring that the deed to secure debt "has been properly canceled of record" and that title to the land under the deed to secure debt from Fellows to Todd "is in no way affected by said note and deed to secure debt," were sufficient to invoke the equitable jurisdiction of the court. On review the case is one in equity within the jurisdiction of this court under the Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. II, Par. IV (Code Ann.  2-3704).</div><div class="casepar">2. The order of cancellation on the deed to secure debt from Tom T. Fellows to W. C. Todd, quoted in the petition as amended, is dated May 15, 1956. It is alleged that the deed to secure debt was recorded on May 18, 1956, and that the order of cancellation was signed on or about February 26, 1957, and entered on the records on that date. Obviously there is some error in these dates, whether the entry of cancellation is valid or invalid, since no entry of cancellation could be entered on the deed records three days before the deed was recorded.</div><div class="casepar">From the petition it is not clear whether or not the cancellation as made and entered upon the deed records conforms in all particulars to the statutory requirements. As between the grantor Fellows and the defendant Todd, however, the first question is, has the note been paid? The petition alleges unequivocally that it has been paid. "[F]ull payment of the secured debt revests in the grantor the title to the property therein conveyed; . . ." Citizens Mercantile Co. v. Easom, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 604</span>, 610 (<span class="casemissing">123 SE 883</span>, 37 ALR 378).</div><div class="casepar">If the defendant Todd released and canceled the deed to secure debt for a valuable consideration, leaving the note executed in connection with the deed to secure debt from Fellows to Todd unpaid, Fellows would have a perfect equity in the property described in the deed to secure debt given by him to Todd. A perfect equity is a good title even at law and is sufficient to support or defeat ejectment. Pitts v. McWhorter, <span class="casemissing">3 Ga. 5</span> (46 AD 405); Peterson v. Orr, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. 464</span> (58 AD 484); May v. Sorrell, <span class="casemissing">153 Ga. 47</span>, 52 (<span class="casemissing">111 SE 810</span>); Elrod v. Bagley, <span class="casemissing">154 Ga. 670 (115 SE 3)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">As to the present alleged owners of the land, and other petitioners named as warrantors of the title thereto, if the entry of cancellation is a substantial compliance with the law, they would be in the position of bona fide purchasers for value without notice of an equity. It is the rule that a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of an equity will be protected. Code  37-111; Gleaton v. Wright, <span class="casemissing">149 Ga. 220 (100 SE 72)</span>. The fact that the petitioners' rights might ultimately be determined in subsequent litigation does not mean that they are not entitled to the relief prayed, that a final judgment of cancellation of the deed to secure debt be entered, since such final judgment of cancellation appears from the allegations of the petition to be necessary for their full and complete protection. Code  37-1407, 37-1408.</div><div class="casepar">Generally where all parties at interest are parties to the cause, and in which cause the rights of all parties might properly be finally adjudicated, jurisdiction in equity is not ousted because there may be pending an action at law in another court. Equity may restrain proceedings in another or the same court. Code  55-101. "Equity seeks always to do complete justice; and hence, having the parties before the court rightfully, it will proceed to give full relief to all parties in reference to the subject-matter of the suit, provided the court has jurisdiction for that purpose." Code  37-105. Why have two or more litigated cases in separate superior courts when a trial in the Superior Court of Coffee County might end the entire controversy between the litigants, "especially where the demands of each grow out of the same transaction?" Kirkpatrick v. Holland, <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 708</span>, 710 (<span class="casemissing">98 SE 265</span>). See Scott v. Scott, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. 102</span>; National Bank of Athens v. Carlton, <span class="casemissing">96 Ga. 469 (23 SE 388)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">The rule that courts generally will not entertain an action for declaratory judgment as to questions which may be determined in a pending action (Shippen v. Folsom, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 58 (7)</span>, <span class="casemissing">35 SE2d 915</span>; Darnell v. Tate, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../196/99/index.html">206 Ga. 576</a></span>, 586, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../196/99/index.html">58 SE2d 160</a></span>; Staub v. Mayor &amp;c. of Baxley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/87/index.html">211 Ga. 1</a></span>, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../181/87/index.html">83 SE2d 606</a></span>) is not applicable in the present cause where the petitioners are seeking equitable relief. Counsel for the defendant insist that the pending action in Troup County should be allowed to proceed, and that the results of the action in Troup County would determine the validity of the entry of cancellation of the deed to secure debt from Fellows to Todd. This is not necessarily true. In the action on the note by Todd against Fellows in Troup County, Fellows might avail himself of a defense that would defeat a recovery by Todd, but which would not be a final determination of the equitable rights of all parties in the present litigation. National Bank of Athens v. Carlton, <span class="casemissing">96 Ga. 469</span>, supra. The present alleged owners of the land and their warrantors of title can not, of course, have their rights finally determined in an action in which they are not parties. Hodges v. Stuart Lumber Co., <span class="casemissing">140 Ga. 569 (79 SE 462)</span>; Land Development Corp. v. Union Trust Co of Md., <span class="casemissing">180 Ga. 785</span>, 790 (<span class="casemissing">180 SE 836</span>).</div><div class="casepar">Assuming that Todd may have obtained jurisdiction of Fellows in his suit on the note in Troup County, cancellation of the entry of cancellation of the deed to secure debt could not be entered in a suit at law on the note which the deed secures, and this could not be done in the absence of the warrantors and the present alleged owners of the land as parties thereto. In Malone v. Kelly, <span class="casemissing">101 Ga. 194</span>, 200 (<span class="casemissing">28 SE 689</span>), it was held: "The court could not undertake to cancel a written instrument conveying title to property, without having before it all the parties to be affected by the proposed cancellation." In Pope v. U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 769</span>, 779 (<span class="casemissing">20 SE2d 13</span>), it was held: "A person without any interest in the subject-matter of an equity suit, and who can not be affected by the decree rendered therein, is neither a necessary nor proper party. Beall v. Blake, <span class="casemissing">16 Ga. 119 (4)</span>; Westfall v. Scott, <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. 233</span>; Lang v. Brown, <span class="casemissing">29 Ga. 628</span>. But all persons directly interested in the result and who will be affected by the decree are necessary parties. Henderson v. Napier, <span class="casemissing">107 Ga. 342 (33 SE 433)</span>; Warren County Fertilizer Co. v. Reese, <span class="casemissing">156 Ga. 824 (2)</span> (<span class="casemissing">120 SE 534</span>.)" See also Blaisdell v. Bohr, <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. 56</span>; Huey v. National Bank of Fitzgerald, <span class="casemissing">177 Ga. 64</span>, 68 (<span class="casemissing">169 SE 491</span>); Benton v. Turk, <span class="casemissing">188 Ga. 710</span>, 730 (<span class="casemissing">4 SE2d 580</span>). Under the authorities cited, the warrantors and present alleged owners of the land can not have their rights determined in a case where they have not been named parties, have not been served with process, and who are not before the court in any manner, and they are essential parties in any action to cancel the entry of cancellation which Todd asserts is fraudulent.</div><div class="casepar">The petitioners can not procure the relief they seek by intervention in the pending action in Troup County. "The general rule at common law is that persons who are not parties to a suit cannot file an intervention therein." Potts v. Wilson, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 316 (2) (123 SE 294)</span>; Sampson v. Vann, <span class="casemissing">203 Ga. 612 (48 SE2d 293)</span>. There are some exceptions to the general rule. In all instances, however, the intervenor takes the case as he finds it, and the alleged owners of the land in the present action could not by intervention convert the action at law in Troup County for a judgment on the note into an equitable action for a judgment of cancellation of the deed to secure debt. Smith v. Manning, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 209 (116 SE 813)</span>; Graves v. Decatur, <span class="casemissing">167 Ga. 690 (146 SE 635)</span>; Merritt v. Georgia Chemical Works, <span class="casemissing">170 Ga. 153 (152 SE 246)</span>; Manning v. Wills, <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 82 (17 SE2d 261)</span>. It is the rule in this State that a party may not intervene where he has a remedy which may be asserted in a proper proceeding. Delaney v. Sheehan, <span class="casemissing">138 Ga. 510</span>, 515 (<span class="casemissing">75 SE 632</span>); Tanner v. American Nat. Bank of Macon, <span class="casemissing">145 Ga. 512</span>, 513 (<span class="casemissing">89 SE 515</span>); Arnold v. West Lumber Co., <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 207</span>, 212 (<span class="casemissing">31 SE2d 410</span>).</div><div class="casepar">The petitioners alleging themselves to be owners of the lands described had the right to seek relief in equity in the county of Todd's residence, and their right to seek such relief should not be denied solely because Fellows is joined as a party plaintiff at a time when Fellows is named as a defendant in an action at law in another court, the jurisdiction of which court Fellows denies.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
