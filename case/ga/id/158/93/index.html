Before Judge Long.</div><div class="casepresiding">ALMAND, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The record does not support the contentions of the plaintiffs in error, and the judge could not properly have gone beyond the judgment rendered. The judgment is not shown to be erroneous for any of the reasons urged by counsel for the plaintiffs in error.</div><div class="casepar">The will of A. O. Bacon (which was probated in solemn form) in Item Nine gave in trust described property, to be known as "Baconsfield," to named trustees for the benefit of his wife and two named daughters for their joint use, benefit, and enjoyment during the term of their natural lives. It was provided that upon the death of the last survivor, the property, including all remainders and reversions, "shall thereupon vest in and belong to the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon, and to their successors forever, in trust for the sole, perpetual and unending, use, benefit and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys and white children of the City of Macon to be by them forever used and enjoyed as a park and pleasure ground, subject to the restrictions, government, management, rules and control" of a board of managers consisting of seven persons, not less than four to be white women and all seven to be white persons. In order to provide for the maintenance of the park, income from described real property and bonds was to be expended by the board of managers.</div><div class="casepar">Charles E. Newton and others, as members of the Board of Managers of Baconsfield, brought an equitable petition against the City of Macon (in its capacity as trustee under Item Nine of the will of A. O. Bacon), and Guyton G. Abney and others, as successor trustees under the will holding assets for the benefit of certain residuary beneficiaries. It was alleged: The city as trustee holds the legal title to a tract of land in Macon, Bibb County, known as Baconsfield, under Item Nine of the will of A. O. Bacon. As directed in the will, the board through the years has confined the exclusive use of Baconsfield to those persons designated in the will. The city is now failing and refusing to enforce the provisions of the will with respect to the exclusive use of Baconsfield. Such conduct on the part of the city constitutes such a violation of trust as to require its removal as trustee. It was prayed that: the city be removed as a trustee under the will; the court enter a decree appointing one of more freeholders, residents of the city, to serve as trustee or trustees under the will; legal title to Baconsfield and any other assets held by the city as trustee be decreed to be in the trustee or trustees so appointed for the uses originally declared by the testator; and for further relief.</div><div class="casepar">The City of Macon filed its answer asserting that it can not legally enforce racial segregation of the property known as Baconsfield, and therefore it is unable to comply with the specific intention of the testator with regard to maintaining the property for the exclusive use, benefit, and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys, and white children of the city. The city prayed that the court construe the will and enter a decree setting forth the duties and obligations of the city in the premises. The other defendants admitted the allegations of the petition and prayed that the city be removed as a trustee. The petitioners thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Reverend E. S. Evans and others, alleging themselves to be Negro residents of the City of Macon, on behalf of themselves and other Negroes similarly situated, filed an intervention in the cause and asserted: The restriction and limitation reserving the use and enjoyment of Baconsfield Park to "white women, white girls, white boys and white children of the City of Macon," is violative of the public policy of the United States of America and violative of the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. The court as an agency of the State of Georgia cannot, consistently with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the equivalent provision of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, enter an order appointing private citizens as trustees for the manifest purpose of operating, managing, and regulating public property (which passed to the City of Macon under a charitable trust created by will) in a racially discriminatory manner. Although the charitable devise at the time of its creation was capable of being executed in the exact manner provided by the will, by operation of law it is no longer capable of further execution in the exact manner provided for by the testator. The court should effectuate the general charitable purpose of the testator to establish and endow a public park by refusing to appoint private persons as trustees.</div><div class="casepar">By amendment to the petition it was alleged: By the will of A. O. Bacon a trust was established for his heirs. The trust has been executed as to four of his seven heirs now living, A. O. B. Sparks, Willis B. Sparks, Jr., Virginia Lamar Sparks, and M. Garten Sparks. The interests of three remaining heirs, Louise Curry Williams, Shirley Curry Cheatham, and Manley Lamar Curry, are still held under an executed trust by four trustees holding under the authority of the will, these trustees being Guyton Abney, J. D. Crump, T. I. Denmark, and Dr. W. G. Lee. These seven persons have an interest in the litigation since, if the trust purpose expressed in the will with respect to the designation of persons who may use Baconsfield should fail, the property comprising Baconsfield, together with the property providing the upkeep of Baconsfield, will revert to the estate of A. O. Bacon and be distributed to these heirs. The amendment prayed that the Sparks heirs be allowed to intervene and that the trustees be allowed to assert the interests of the other heirs. It was also prayed that the Negro intervenors and other members of the Negro race resident in Macon be permanently enjoined from entering and using the facilities of Baconsfield. The Sparks heirs and the trustees of the other heirs of A. O. Bacon filed an intervention praying that the relief sought by the original petitioners be granted, but that if such relief not be granted, the property revert to them.</div><div class="casepar">The City of Macon filed an amendment to its answer, alleging that pursuant to resolution adopted by the Mayor and Council of the city at its regular meeting on February 4, 1964, the city has resigned as trustee under the will of A. O. Bacon. It prayed that the resolution be accepted by the court.</div><div class="casepar">The Negro intervenors filed an amendment to their intervention in which they asserted: The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the court from enjoining Negroes from the use of the park, and from accepting the resignation of the City of Macon as trustee and appointing new trustees for the purpose of enjoining (enforcing?) the racially discriminatory provision in the will of A. O. Bacon. Code  69-504 prescribes racial discrimination and is therefore violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Since the racially discriminatory provision in the will was dictated by that unconstitutional statute, enforcement of the racially discriminatory provision is constitutionally prohibited. Code  108-202, properly construed, requires that the racially discriminatory provision in the will be declared null and void. The intervenors prayed that the court withhold approval of the attempted resignation of the city as trustee under the will, direct the city to continue to administer the park on a racially non-discriminatory basis, and deny the injunction sought by the petitioners to exclude Negroes from the use of the park.</div><div class="casepar">On March 10, 1964, the judge of the superior court entered an order and decree in the case which adjudged as follows: (1) The intervenors named are proper parties in the case and are proper representatives of the class which their intervention states that they represent, the Negro citizens of Bibb County and the City of Macon. (2) The defendants, Guyton G. Abney, J. D. Crump, T. I. Denmark, and Dr. W. G. Lee, as successor trustees under the will of A. O. Bacon, and intervenors A. O. B. Sparks, Willis B. Sparks, Jr., Virginia Lamar Sparks and M. Garten Sparks are also proper parties. (3) The City of Macon having submitted its resignation as the trustee of the property known as Baconsfield, the resignation is accepted by the court. (4) Hugh M. Comer, Lawton Miller, and B. L. Register are appointed as trustees to serve in lieu of the City of Macon. (5) The court retains jurisdiction for the purpose of appointing other trustees that may be necessary in the future. (6) It is unnecessary to pass upon the secondary contention of the intervenors Guyton G. Abney and others.</div><div class="casepar">Reverend E. S. Evans and others in their writ of error to this court assign error on this order of the trial judge. Their contentions will appear from the opinion.</div><div class="casepar"> Counsel for the plaintiffs in error (the Negro intervenors) assert that the decree of the judge of the superior court was "patent enforcement of racial discrimination contrary to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment" to the Federal Constitution. The decree did not enforce, or purport to enforce, any judgment, ruling, or decree as related to the intervenors. After determining that all parties were properly before the court, the decree did two things: (1) Accepted the resignation of the City of Macon as trustee of Baconsfield; and (2) appointed new trustees.</div><div class="casepar">Jones v. Habersham, 107 U. S. 174 (5) (2 SC 336, 27 LE 401). Under the law of this State any person may, by will; grant, gift, deed, or other instrument, give or devise property for any charitable purpose. Ga. L. 1937, p. 593 (Code Ann.  108-207). Any public convenience might be a proper subject for a charitable trust. Code  108-203. A charity once established is always subject to supervision and direction by a court of equity to render effectual its purpose. Code  108-204. It is the rule that a charitable trust shall never fail for the want of a trustee. Code  108-302.</div><div class="casepar">Whether the will of A. O. Bacon, establishing a trust for the operation of Baconsfield, contemplated by the language, "to the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon and to their successors" (italics ours), that the named trustee might resign, need not be determined. The City of Macon did resign, and the judge of the superior court was confronted with the commandment of Code  108-302 that a trust shall never fail for the want of a trustee. Being empowered to appoint trustees when a vacancy occurs for any cause, Thompson v. Hale, <span class="casemissing">123 Ga. 305 (51 SE 383)</span>, Harris v. Brown, <span class="casemissing">124 Ga. 310 (2)</span> (<span class="casemissing">52 SE 610</span>, 2 LRA (NS) 828), Woodbery v. Atlas Realty Co., <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 712 (98 SE 472)</span>, Sparks v. Ridley, <span class="casemissing">150 Ga. 210 (3) (103 SE 425)</span>, the judge exercised such power and appointed successor trustees.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the plaintiffs in error assert that: "As the City was unable to comply with the racially discriminatory direction of the trust, three alternatives were open to the lower court: (1) declare the racially discriminatory provision null and void; (2) remove the trustee (or accept its resignation) and appoint a non-governmental trustee; (3) declare failure of the trust." They insist that the judge should have chosen the first alternative.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for plaintiffs in error assert that the court should have applied the provisions of Code  108-202 that when a valid charitable bequest is incapable for some reason of exact execution in the exact manner provided by the testator a court of equity will carry it into effect in such way as nearly as possible to effectuate his intention. The answer to this contention is: the application of the cy-pres rule, as provided in this Code section, was not invoked by the primary parties to this case, and even if it be conceded (which we do not concede, see Smith v. Manning, <span class="casemissing">155 Ga. 209</span>, <span class="casemissing">116 SE 813</span>, and Fountain v. Bryan, <span class="casemissing">176 Ga. 31</span>, <span class="casemissing">166 SE 766</span>) that the intervenors could raise such issue, the facts before the trial judge were wholly insufficient to invoke a ruling that the charitable bequest was or was not incapable for some reason of exact execution in the exact manner provided by the testator. There is no testimony in the record of any nature or character, that the board of managers provided by the will, can not operate the park pursuant to the terms and conditions of the will.</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the plaintiffs in error cite Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of the City of Philadelphia, 353 U. S. 230 (77 SC 806, 1 LE2d 792). In the Pennsylvania case the United States Supreme Court pointed out that the board which operated Girard College was an agency of the State of Pennsylvania by legislative act, and that the refusal to admit Negroes to Girard college was therefore discrimination by the State. Upon the return of the case to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion, that court remanded the case to the Orphans' Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, on the second appearance of the case (see Girard College Trusteeship, 391 Pa. 434, 138 A2d 844), stated that the Orphans' Court construed the United States Supreme Court's opinion to mean that the Board of City Trusts was constitutionally incapable of administering Girard College in accordance with the testamentary requirements of the founder, and the Orphans' Court entered a decree removing the Board as trustee of Girard College and substituting therefor thirteen private citizens, none of whom held any public office or otherwise exercised any governmental power under the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed this action on review, and again sustained action denying admission to Girard College by the Negro applicants. Counsel for the defendants in error cite Girard College Trusteeship, 391 Pa. 434, and strongly rely on this Pennsylvania case. (On review by the United States Supreme Court the motion to dismiss was granted, and treating the record as a petition for certiorari, certiorari was denied. Pennsylvania v. Board of Director of City Trusts of Pennsylvania, 357 U. S. 570, 78 SC 1383, 2 LE2d 1546. A motion for rehearing was denied, 358 U. S. 858). In so far as the Girard College Trusteeship case is applicable on its facts to the present case, it supports the rulings we have made.</div><div class="casepar">The record does not sustain the contentions of the plaintiffs in error, and the judge could not properly have gone beyond the judgment rendered. This judgment is not shown to be erroneous for any of the reasons urged by counsel for the plaintiffs in error.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
