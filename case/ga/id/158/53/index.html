Burke Superior Court. Before Judge Kennedy.</div><div class="casepresiding">GRICE, Justice.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. The evidence supported the verdict finding the defendant guilty of murder, and therefore the general grounds of his motion for new trial were properly overruled.</div><div class="casepar">2. Under the evidence, the remarks of the solicitor general complained of here were not improper, and denials of the defendant's two motions for mistrial based thereon were not erroneous.</div><div class="casepar"> Convicted of murder with a recommendation, Bennett Radcliff assigns error upon the denial of his motion for new trial. He was indicted by the grand jury of Burke County for the murder of his wife. Following his trial in the superior court of that county he filed an amended motion for new trial which, in addition to the general grounds, urged two special grounds, predicated upon alleged improper argument by the solicitor general.</div><div class="casepar">1. We first consider the general grounds to ascertain whether the verdict is supported by the evidence. That which we regard as material follows.</div><div class="casepar">There was testimony that the death of the defendant's wife was caused by bullet wounds in her head; that an empty pistol was found near her body; that several fired pistol shells were on the floor nearby; that a number of bullet markings were visible in the wall behind where her body lay, some at her level; and that there were no powder burns on her.</div><div class="casepar">A city policeman testified that shortly after the homicide the defendant told him, "I've done a terrible thing. I have killed my wife and shot myself," and that the defendant was wounded.</div><div class="casepar">The sheriff testified that the morning after the homicide the defendant said that "he had played hell"; that he and his wife " 'got in an argument and I went out and got the pistol out of the car and brought it back and laid it upon the stove' "; and that "when he came out of the bathroom she shot him, and he took it away from her and killed her."</div><div class="casepar">There were no eyewitnesses to the homicide and the physical facts are consistent with either malice or lack of malice. Therefore, these two statements of the defendant are highly significant in so far as the essential element of malice is concerned.</div><div class="casepar">Ordinarily, "the law presumes every homicide to be malicious, until the contrary appears from circumstances of alleviation, of excuse, or justification, and . . . it is incumbent on the prisoner to make out such circumstances to the satisfaction of the jury, unless they appear from the evidence produced against him." Mann v. State, <span class="casemissing">124 Ga. 760 (1)</span> (<span class="casemissing">53 SE 324</span>, 4 LRA (NS) 934). However, the rule is also that "If the accused admits the killing with a deadly weapon, but adds an explanation which might negative malice, no presumption that the homicide was murder would arise on such admission; but if no explanation were added tending to reduce the grade of the homicide, that presumption would arise." Futch v. State, <span class="casemissing">90 Ga. 472 (8) (16 SE 102)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">The conflict between two statements of this nature calls for application of a further rule: "In the trial of one indicted for murder, where the evidence adduced to establish the homicide presents two conflicting theories of fact, one based upon circumstances indicating malice and the other upon warranted inferences which negative its existence, then it becomes a question of fact, to be decided by the jury, as to which one of these inconsistent theories is in accord with the real truth of the occurrence." Mann v. State, <span class="casemissing">124 Ga. 760 (1)</span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">In the evidentiary situation in the case at bar, the jury chose to accept the theory of malice from the defendant's statement to the policeman. Their verdict is amply supported by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">For the reasons stated, the trial court did not err in overruling the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">2. We turn now to the special grounds complaining of the trial court's failure on two occasions to declare a mistrial for alleged improper argument to the jury. No rebuke of counsel or instruction to the jury was given in either instance.</div><div class="casepar">(a) On the first occasion the solicitor general said: "And there are some things that stand out here like a sore thumb; that are proved and there is no question or doubt about it. And here is what they admit--that he went out twice, out in the street, went to his car, went in the compartment. He got this deadly thing out of the compartment and brought it in the house and says he put it on the stove. B-a-n-g. Now His Honor is going to tell you this--and I hope His Honor will charge it. You cannot, in Georgia or any state, create an emergency, and after having created the emergency, take advantage of your own wrong initial act and use it for self-defense or otherwise. The minute he dared go out there and bring this thing out of the street and bring it in there and put it down that man created an emergency."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant, in support of his motion, urged that such statement was unfair, was calculated to prejudice the jury and had no foundation of fact.</div><div class="casepar">However, according to the testimony of the sheriff, the defendant stated to him that "I went out and got the pistol out of the car and brought it back and laid it upon the stove . . ." and the sheriff on cross examination repeated that in substance and said that the defendant said "he had it in the glove compartment of the car." In his unsworn statement the defendant did not deny saying this to the sheriff.</div><div class="casepar">Therefore, we regard this argument as not improper, but a legitimate inference from the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(b) On the second occasion the solicitor general, according to the approved recital of facts in this ground, stated to the jury: "Dr. Ward told you. Dr. Ward is the expert in this county and believe me during his tenure of office, Gentlemen, he has looked at many a one. Because Lord knows we have a lot of killings down here, with negroes especially. And he has looked at 'em. And he tells you that two of these wounds of entry here--I never saw a shot in my life--the undertaker says one went in here and the other one went in here."</div><div class="casepar">Whereupon, the defendant's counsel moved for a mistrial and then and there insisted that the language "Because Lord knows we have had a lot of killings down here and we have to do something about it" was improper, highly inflammatory and prejudicial. However, since from the foregoing recital of fact in this ground it appears that the language complained of did not include the words "and we have to do something about it," the issue is as to the propriety of the statement "Because Lord knows we have had a lot of killings down here."</div><div class="casepar">We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for mistrial on account of this argument.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, in our view, these two grounds were properly overruled.</div><div class="casepar">We find no error in the trial court's denial of the defendant's amended motion for new trial, and its judgment is therefore</div><div class="casepar">Affirmed. All the Justices concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">George Hains, Solicitor General, H.
