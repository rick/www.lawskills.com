J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">It not appearing from the petition that the plaintiff was as a matter of law barred by his own negligence or that his injuries were caused by his own failure to use ordinary care, and the petition alleging that the defendants were negligent, it was error to sustain the general demurrer of the defendants and dismiss the petition.</div><div class="casepar">T. M. Forbes Sr. brought suit against Clarence H. Vanderpool, Interurban Transit Lines Inc., a common carrier of passengers, operating a bus line between towns in the Atlanta area, and Carolina Casualty Company, which was the insurance carrier of said bus company, in which he sought damages on account of certain personal injuries sustained as a result of the alleged negligence of the defendants, Vanderpool and the bus line. It appeared from the petition: that on May 12, 1952, at 8:20 a. m., the plaintiff was driving a 1951 Buick car belonging to Cotton Manufacturers Association, in an easterly direction on Harris Street, in the City of Atlanta; that the plaintiff was on his own right side of that street as he approached the intersection thereof with Techwood Drive in Atlanta; that on reaching the intersection, the plaintiff brought the Buick to a full stop and awaited the movement of a truck, which was stopped to his left on Harris Street, a one-way street, in order that he might have a clear view of traffic moving both north and south on Techwood Drive before he proceeded into the intersection; that the plaintiff looked to his right and to his left before proceeding across Techwood Drive, and at the time he entered this intersection for the purpose of crossing Techwood Drive on his own right side of Harris Street, a bus of the defendant bus lines, which was being driven by the defendant Vanderpool, its employee, on business for the bus line and within the scope of his employment, was at such great distance from the intersection and proceeding in a southerly direction upon Techwood Drive "as to then constitute no perceivable hazard in the exercise of ordinary care to your petitioner"; that the driver of the bus proceeded toward this intersection at the high and reckless speed of 35 miles an hour, and when the plaintiff had crossed more than half way over this intersection this bus ran into and struck the Buick, the impact damaging the Buick and injuring the plaintiff. The plaintiff set up that Cotton Manufacturers Association had transferred to him for a valuable consideration its right of action for property damage to said Buick, and that same had been damaged in the amount of $1000 by reason of the negligence of the defendants. It was set up that the bus line was liable for the negligence of the defendant bus driver under the doctrine of respondeat superior, and that the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries and damage was the negligence of the defendants in the following particulars: (a) in driving the bus at a high and excessive rate of speed in excess of 25 miles an hour, contrary to section 88-501 of the Code of the City of Atlanta, providing that "twenty-five miles per hour shall be the maximum speed," as per valid ordinance of said city; (b) in failing to slow down the speed of the bus as same approached this intersection in violation of the State law, which was negligence per se; (c) in failing to keep a proper lookout ahead and to his left; (d) in failing to apply the brakes of the bus in time to avoid the collision; (e) in failing to yield the right of way to the plaintiff contrary to the provisions of a valid ordinance of Atlanta,</div><div class="casepar">known as Code Sec. 88-918 (2), to-wit: "The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right of way to a vehicle which has entered the intersection from a different street"; and (f) in violating that portion of a valid ordinance of said City, Code Sec. 88-920 (a), italicized in the following: "The driver of a vehicle shall stop as required by this Act at the entrance to a through highway and shall yield the right of way to other vehicles which have entered the intersection from said through street or which are approaching so closely on said through street as to constitute an immediate hazard, but said driver having so yielded may proceed and the driver of all other vehicles approaching the intersection on said through street shall yield the right of way to the vehicle so proceeding into or across the street," (italics ours), same being negligence per se.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants demurred generally to the petition and the trial judge sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition. The plaintiff excepts to this judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> Questions of negligence, contributory negligence, proximate cause and the like, except in plain and unmistakable cases, are for the jury to determine, and not for the court to pass upon as questions of law. Georgia Power Co. v. Braswell, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 654</span> (173 S. E. 763). The plaintiff alleged that, as he approached Techwood Drive, in the City of Atlanta, from the west and traveling easterly, the plaintiff being on Harris Street, a one-way street, he brought his Buick car to a complete stop and looked both to his right and to his left, and seeing no other vehicle near enough on said Techwood Drive to constitute a danger, he was proceeding across the intersection when the bus of the defendant bus line struck the Buick and injured him. The plaintiff charges that the bus driver approached this intersection at an excessive speed in violation of the city ordinance and struck the Buick after the plaintiff had proceeded into the intersection and halfway across the same. There is a City of Atlanta ordinance, according to the allegations of the petition, that the driver of a bus shall not exceed 25 miles an hour. If Techwood Drive is a through street the plaintiff had a right to cross over the same, being on a one-way street, having looked both to his right and left and seeing no other vehicle then close enough to constitute danger. In such a case, under said ordinance and the law generally, it was the duty of the bus driver to yield to the plaintiff and permit him to cross the intersection. Under the allegations of the petition, the plaintiff was in plain view of the bus driver as he crossed over the intersection. "Although vehicles traveling along a street which has been designated by law as a traffic boulevard have the right of way over vehicles coining into the boulevard from intersecting streets, this right is not absolute under all circumstances and conditions, but is relative only, and is determinable by the relative positions of the approaching vehicles, their relative speed, and other attending circumstances. A vehicle therefore, when crossing such a traffic boulevard at an intersecting street may, under some conditions, have the right of way over vehicles approaching on the boulevard, and therefore not be guilty of negligence or of a violation of law, in attempting to cross the boulevard in front of the approaching vehicle, but, in crossing the boulevard may, when considering the relative positions of both vehicles, their relative speed and other circumstances, be in the exercise of ordinary care and diligence." Brown v. Sanders, <span class="casemissing">44 Ga. App. 114</span> (160 S. E. 542). The plaintiff was not guilty of negligence as a matter of law, even if Techwood Drive as a traffic boulevard, in attempting to cross the same, under the allegations of the petition. He looked both to his right and to his left, and no vehicle was close enough to constitute a hazard in his crossing over the street when he did. The bus of the defendant bus line approached in violation of the speed law, and without keeping a proper lookout, and also in violation of the ordinance as to vehicles on a through street. A jury could find that the plaintiff was not negligent, and that the driver of the bus was negligent and that such negligence was the cause of the plaintiff's injury. It was, therefore, error for the court to sustain the general demurrer and dismiss the petition. See also Richardson v. Coker, 78 Ga,. App. 209, 212 (50 S. E. 2d, 781); Ivey v. Hall, <span class="casemissing">77 Ga. App. 350</span> (48 S. E. 2d, 788); Williams v. Grier, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 327</span> (26 S. E. 2d, 698). The petition also charges the driver</div><div class="casepar">of the bus with failing to slow down as he approached this intersection. This was negligence per se, being in violation of Code  68-303.</div><div class="casepar">We have examined such cases as Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Mullins, <span class="casemissing">7 Ga. App. 381</span>, 383 (66 S. E. 1028), and Moore v. Seaboard Airline Ry. Co., <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 466</span> (118 S. E. 471), and do not find them controlling or applicable here. These cases are dealing with railroad crossings, and are not contrary to what was held in the Richardson case or the Brown case, and to what we now hold. The present case does not show as a matter of law that the plaintiff's negligence was greater than that of the defendants, if the plaintiff was negligent, or that the cause of the plaintiff's injuries was his own failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety. The petition charges acts of negligence to the defendants. The case made by the petition was sufficient for submission to the jury, and the court improperly sustained the general demurrer thereto. If a jury finds the defendants negligent as alleged, and that such negligence caused the plaintiff's injury, they would be authorized to find in favor of the plaintiff. In such a situation, it was error to sustain a general demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">This case is not at all similar to a case of one who deliberately goes upon a railroad crossing with knowledge of an approaching train. The plaintiff had a right to cross this intersection. He looked to the right and to the left and did not see any vehicle near enough to constitute a hazard in his crossing. The plaintiff then proceeded into the intersection. The defendant driver approached the intersection, while the plaintiff was in view in the intersection, without slowing down as required by the Georgia law and at an excessive and reckless rate of speed. Under the ordinance, the plaintiff had a right to cross over, even if Techwood Drive is a through street, which is not alleged.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleges a compliance by the plaintiff with the requirements of this ordinance before he attempted to cross the street.</div><div class="casepar">The court erred in dismissing plaintiff's petition.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Clinton C.
