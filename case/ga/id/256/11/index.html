Before Judge Carlisle.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai appeals the grant of summary judgment to Silver Dollar City, Inc., doing business as White Water Theme Park, on her claim against White Water based upon an injury she sustained to her knee while using one of the theme park's water slides. The trial court also granted summary judgment on Mr. Desai's claim for loss of consortium.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai's deposition testimony shows that she was a frequent visitor to White Water and that she and her family had season passes for at least three years, including the year she was injured. In fact, by the day of her injury, June 26, 1994, this was the fourth or fifth trip to White Water that year. Mrs. Desai testified that she was injured when, after going down the water slide at White Water in a raft as she had numerous times, she got out of the raft without being told to by an attendant and was struck by another raft. The record also shows that Mrs. Desai had observed the water slide in operation on many occasions.</div><div class="casepar">On the day Mrs. Desai was injured the following announcement was played continuously over the public address system at the beginning of the slide and on the walkway leading to the top of the slide:</div><div class="casepar">"Welcome to Bahama Bob-Slide. This is a thrilling ride. When you get to the top, the lifeguard will instruct you on how to board the raft. Listen carefully to these instructions. While in the raft, sit facing the center with legs crossed and hold onto the handles. Do not lean forward as you might bump heads. Remain seated throughout the entire ride. At the bottom of the ride do not get out of the raft until a lifeguard instructs you to do so. Other rafts will be coming down behind you and the water is shallow. Disregard for these rules may result in injury to yourself or others." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">Although Mrs. Desai's affidavit states that she did not hear this recorded message, she has not disputed that the message was being played.</div><div class="casepar">Further, this sign was posted near the entrance of the slide:</div><div class="casepar">BAHAMA</div><div class="casepar">BOB-SLIDE</div><div class="casepar">RATING: THRILLING</div><div class="casepar">WATER DEPTH: 0-3 FEET</div><div class="casepar">RESTRICTION: MAX 6 people per Aquadiscs</div><div class="casepar">HOW TO RIDE</div><div class="casepar">.

DO NOT STEP ONTO CONVEYOR</div><div class="casepar">. FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THESE RULES MAY RESULT IN</div><div class="casepar"> INJURY TO YOUR SELF OR OTHERS</div><div class="casepar">Although Mrs. Desai admits she definitely read the sign the first time she rode in 1992 or 1993, she testified that she did not read the sign on the day of the incident even though nothing prevented her from reading it. Nevertheless, Mrs. Desai testified that two years earlier when she read the warning sign, she knew that she should wait for an attendant to tell her to exit the raft even though she may not have remembered that on the day she was injured because she was not consciously thinking about it.</div><div class="casepar">In response to a question concerning whether she knew that she should wait for the attendant before exiting the raft, Mrs. Desai testified: "See, what happened, l came out immediately from the thing. I didn't have any problem to come out. Okay. My mother was with me, who was 65 years old. I wanted to make sure she got off properly from the ride. Because it was wobbly on the water, the raft. So I was holding her raft so she can get off. And the lifeguard at that time was not present. They were doing something. And I wanted to make sure she got off. Because I was worried about her being the older person, and so she could come up safe. And I had no idea the raft from the back would come up and hit me from the back. And I was unaware of that."</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai testified that her mother wanted to go on a slide and Mrs. Desai selected the Bahama Bob-Slide because she had been on it herself so many times. Mrs. Desai testified that she went in one raft with her children and her mother and others from her family went in another raft. She testified that, "I came out immediately, as soon as -- because of -- you know, because I wanted to make sure it wasn't any problem for me to get out. Because I wanted to make sure my mother could get up properly because it was wobbling. And she was sixty-five years old. And I was worried about her, that if something happened to her, because she was visiting from India. And I wanted to make sure she didn't get hurt. Because this was the first ride in her life. So I wanted to make sure. So I was holding the tube so she could get off properly. And I had no idea the other tube came and hit me on the side. And I was not aware of it. And due to the impact, I fell down immediately into the water. At that time, the lifeguard ran to me to help me out." Mrs. Desai further testified her mother was still seated on the right side of the raft and it was her plan to stabilize the raft so that her mother could get out. Mrs. Desai also testified that on all of her previous rides on this slide she also exited the raft without the assistance of lifeguards.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, Mrs. Desai's deposition establishes that she left the raft first because she wanted to make sure her mother got out safely. Mrs. Desai also testified that she could not recall whether there was any reason why she could not wait for a lifeguard to assist her from the raft or whether there was any sense of urgency on her part to get out of the raft. In response to the question that, "[i]n other words, there was nothing that would have prevented you from waiting for the lifeguard to come and help you get out of the raft," Mrs. Desai responded, "I don't remember, sir. I did not think about it." And in response to the question that, "[t]o your recollection, there was nothing that prevented you from waiting on the lifeguards," Mrs. Desai answered, "Sorry. I don't remember anything about that. It was a routine thing. And we just did the routine things."</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai also testified that her children were getting out of the raft at the same time she was getting out and her mother was the last one to get out of the raft. Further, Mrs. Desai testified that, although she knew another raft would be coming down the slide, she did not expect it to be that close in time, and she never looked to see if another raft was coming.</div><div class="casepar">In response to White Water's motion for summary judgment, Mrs. Desai submitted an affidavit that states that she did not hear the recorded message, and she further testified that her mother panicked and attempted to get out of the raft by herself, head first; that Mrs. Desai looked for lifeguards but they were 25 feet away doing something with rafts and the conveyor system; that she jumped out of the raft to help her mother; and that it was no longer than 15 seconds before she was hit. Additionally, Mrs. Desai's unverified complaint alleges that Mrs. Desai stepped out of the raft "to assist her mother out of the raft."</div><div class="casepar">The record also shows that Mrs. Desai is a certified public accountant who works as a senior accountant for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation managing several departments. She graduated from college with degrees in physics and chemistry.</div><div class="casepar">After White Water moved for summary judgment contending that Mrs. Desai assumed the risk of her injuries, the trial court granted summary judgment on both Mrs. and Mr. Desai's claims. This appeal followed. The Desais contend the trial court erred by granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remain for trial. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. The standards applicable to motions for summary judgment are announced in Lau's Corp. v. Haskins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/1/index.html">261 Ga. 491 (405 SE2d 474)</a></span>. On appeal, a grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if it is right for any reason. Malaga Mgmt. Co. v. John Deere Co., <span class="casemissing">208 Ga. App. 764</span>, 767 (<span class="casemissing">431 SE2d 746</span>). Further, when ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party should be given the benefit of all reasonable doubt, and the court should construe the evidence and all inferences and conclusions therefrom most favorably toward the party opposing the motion. Moore v. Goldome Credit Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/66/index.html">187 Ga. App. 594</a></span>, 595-596 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../390/66/index.html">370 SE2d 843</a></span>). When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment, this Court conducts a de novo review of the law and the evidence. Goring v. Martinez, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/60/index.html">224 Ga. App. 137</a></span>, 138 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/60/index.html">479 SE2d 432</a></span>); Bishop v. Mangal Bhai Enterprises, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/00/index.html">194 Ga. App. 874 (1) (392 SE2d 535)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. Because White Water's motion for summary judgment was based on the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk, White Water had the burden of proving all the elements of that defense. Based upon the evidence set forth above, there can be no reasonable dispute but that White Water met that burden.</div><div class="casepar">Both the recorded announcements and the posted sign clearly advised Mrs. Desai that she should remain in the raft until a lifeguard assisted her. For her own reasons, however, she disregarded those repeated warnings. Moreover, Mrs. Desai's deposition testimony plainly shows that there was no emergency requiring her to leave the raft before she was instructed to do so. As she testified, "it was a routine thing. And we just did the routine things."</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai's affidavit is of no assistance to her because her affidavit contradicts her deposition in most every significant portion and she provided no explanation for these blatant contradictions. On motion for summary judgment a party's self-conflicting testimony is to be construed against her unless a reasonable explanation for the contradiction is offered. Gentile v. Miller &amp;c., Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../520/0/index.html">257 Ga. 583 (361 SE2d 383)</a></span>; Prophecy Corp. v. Charles Rossignol, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../529/7/index.html">256 Ga. 27</a></span>, 30 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../529/7/index.html">343 SE2d 680</a></span>). Because Mrs. Desai offered no explanation for the obvious contradictions between her deposition and her affidavit, the trial court was required to eliminate the favorable portions of her contradictory testimony, then take all testimony as it then stood and construe it in favor of the party opposing the motion in determining whether summary judgment should be granted. Prophecy Corp. v. Charles Rossignol, Inc., supra at 28. Applying this rule and construing Mrs. Desai's deposition testimony in favor of White Water leaves only the evidence that she wanted to get out of the raft first to help her mother, who remained seated in the raft at the time. Also remaining is Mrs. Desai's testimony stating that her getting out of the raft was a routine thing for her and that she knew that other rafts would be coming down the slide behind her.</div><div class="casepar">Additionally, assuming this Court had been permitted to credit the unexplained contradictory statements in Mrs. Desai's affidavit, those statements would not help her case. Who created this problem? Not White Water. Instead, it was created solely by Mrs. Desai's voluntary actions when both Mrs. Desai and her mother should have remained seated. The record shows clearly and palpably that this was a problem of their own creation. Further, the mother's wish to get out of the raft was not the result of any act or omission of White Water. These actions of Mrs. Desai and her mother were the proximate cause of Mrs. Desai's injury as a matter of law.</div><div class="casepar">3. Considering this evidence, the only possible conclusion is that Mrs. Desai assumed the risk. "The defense of assumption of risk requires: (1) that the plaintiff had some actual knowledge of the danger, (2) that [she] understood and appreciated the risk therefrom, and (3) that [she] voluntarily exposed [herself] to such risk. Stated another way: The doctrine of the assumption of the risk of danger applies only where the plaintiff, with a full appreciation of the danger involved and without restriction from [her] freedom of choice either by the circumstances or by coercion, deliberately chooses an obviously perilous course of conduct so that it can be said as a matter of law [she] has assumed all risk of injury. In its simplest and primary sense, assumption of risk means that the plaintiff, in advance, has given [her] consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward [her], and to take [her] chances of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone. In by far the greater number of cases, the consent to assume the risk has not been a matter of express agreement, but has been found to be implied from the conduct of the plaintiff under the circumstances. General Tel. Co. v. Hiers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../416/68/index.html">179 Ga. App. 105</a></span>, 106-107 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../416/68/index.html">345 SE2d 652</a></span>)." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Young v. Brandt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/23/index.html">225 Ga. App. 889</a></span>, 891 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/23/index.html">485 SE2d 519</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">"In assessing whether a plaintiff had the requisite knowledge of the danger and appreciation of the risks, a subjective standard applies, that is, what the particular plaintiff knew, understood and appreciated. [Vaughn v. Pleasent, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../222/1/index.html">266 Ga. 862</a></span>, 864 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../222/1/index.html">471 SE2d 866</a></span>)]; Beringause v. Fogleman Truck Lines, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/66/index.html">200 Ga. App. 822</a></span>, 824 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/66/index.html">409 SE2d 524</a></span>) (1991). A plaintiff lacking such subjective knowledge of the danger will not be taken to have assumed the risk even though his conduct may be deemed contributory negligence for his failure under an objective knowledge standard to discover the danger by exercising the ordinary care required of a reasonable man. Id. at 824." Sutton v. Sumner, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../270/76/index.html">224 Ga. App. 857</a></span>, 859 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../270/76/index.html">482 SE2d 486</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">In this case, we find that the undisputed evidence shows that Mrs. Desai had actual knowledge of the danger because she was warned not to get out of the raft until instructed to do so, she knew that other rafts would be coming down the slide and she knew, because she was warned, that she might be injured if she left the raft. Although in many other instances, Mrs. Desai did not suffer the consequences of her action, in this instance the risk of injury she voluntarily assumed came to pass. In effect, even though she was warned do not do this or you might get hurt, Mrs. Desai tested the danger until she was hurt. It defies both logic and our law to permit a recovery under this evidence.</div><div class="casepar">4. Further, although the dissent discusses many possible acts of negligence whether active or passive, e.g., failure to communicate between the top and bottom of the slide, lifeguards not immediately present, etc., the obvious fact remains that none of these acts would have resulted in Mrs. Desai's injury if she had remained in the raft as she was instructed. It is not the individual acts of negligence to which one must consent, but the known risks arising from the chosen acts or omissions of the plaintiff. Mrs. Desai plainly and without dispute assumed the risk of her injury.</div><div class="casepar">5. "Although assumption of the risk is ordinarily a jury question (Taylor v. Bloodworth, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../349/01/index.html">198 Ga. App. 186</a></span>, 187 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../349/01/index.html">400 SE2d 691</a></span>)), in plain, palpable, and indisputable cases resolution of the issue by a jury is not required. Moore v. Service Merchandise Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../343/56/index.html">200 Ga. App. 463</a></span>, 464 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../343/56/index.html">408 SE2d 480</a></span>)." Young v. Brandt, supra at 891. Accord Daves v. Shepherd Spinal Center, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../284/70/index.html">219 Ga. App. 835 (466 SE2d 692)</a></span>. This is such a case.</div><div class="casepar">6. As Mr. Desai's cause of action is derivative of his wife's claim, the trial court also properly granted summary judgment on his claim as well. Hall v.

The attendants at the top and bottom of the slide were not in communication, either by radio, hand signals, mechanical signal, or signal light, and simply guessed at what intervals to release the next raft down the slide, because the bottom of the slide could not be seen from the top. The attendants at the top of the slide did not know that there were no attendants in place at the bottom in the landing pool, because these attendants were elsewhere, moving rafts to the conveyor belt as part of their duties. The attendants at the top of the slide released rafts at no set intervals. The rafts decelerated as they crossed the landing pool and approached the place of disembarkation.</div><div class="casepar">The so-called warning signs and auditory instructions commanded the plaintiff to stay seated in her raft and not to attempt to get out without the assistance of the attendants; however, all the so-called warnings failed to inform the plaintiff of any danger or the specific danger which injured her, i.e., being struck by another raft. In fact, the warning signs warned of no specific dangers; the nonspecific warnings were, in fact, a command that the passenger was not to stand up or attempt to exit the raft or they might be injured. These so-called warnings were to control the passengers' conduct and not to protect the passengers; if the protection of passengers was, in fact, the true purpose of the signs and intent of the defendant, then the attendants would have been in place to receive them safely at the bottom of the slide instead of doing a less important job of returning rafts. By commanding the passengers to remain docilely in the rafts like a herd of animals, fewer attendants were necessary, because the attendants could go place the rafts on the conveyor belt for return, while the passengers sat obediently, waiting for the attendants to return to the rafts. This was crowd control!</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Desai and her family rode the Bahama Bob-Slide, but when their raft reached the bottom of the slide (flume), there were no attendants to catch the raft and guide it to safety. The raft glided across the landing pool and came to a stop. Plaintiff's mother, who was elderly, started to get out, but had difficulty attempting to exit the raft without the assistance of the attendants. Plaintiff's mother seemed to panic and wanted to get out of the raft immediately without waiting for the attendants. Plaintiff got out of the raft to prevent her mother from falling out of the raft and to steady the raft so that her mother could get out without falling.</div><div class="casepar">The next raft, launched without warning, came down the slide, crossed the length of the landing pool, and struck plaintiff, who was at the rear side of the raft, injuring her. Plaintiff was unaware that the next raft had been launched without warning or would arrive after such a short interval to place her in danger of being struck if she was in the water. The collision of the second raft with the plaintiff occurred at the end of the landing pool where patrons were to disembark. At the time plaintiff was struck by the second raft, she was standing near the left rear portion of the raft in the pool with her hands on the raft, facing her mother, who had been seated on the right side of the raft. Plaintiff was struck within 15 to 30 seconds after she got into the pool.</div><div class="casepar">The attendants, who had been at the bottom of the slide prior to the launch of plaintiff's raft, were then busy elsewhere, sending rafts up the conveyor belt some 25 feet away when plaintiff's raft came to a stop. Although the attendants were only twenty-five feet and approximately ten seconds away, they were not at the point of disembarkation when plaintiff's raft stopped; did not warn plaintiff or her mother to stay seated and to remain in the raft ultimately could provide assistance; and did not warn plaintiff to look out for the approaching second raft after she got into the pool. They were too busy clearing other rafts from the pool, to help, look, or warn. If they had bothered to look, the attendants were close enough to see what was happening and to warn her before she was struck. After the plaintiff was struck, it took the attendants only ten seconds to reach her.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The first issue that should have been addressed by the majority was whether or not, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span> (e), the burden of production of evidence shifted to the plaintiff/non-moving party to show negligent acts or omissions of the defendant/moving party and whether evidence existed that negates the possibility of plaintiff showing negligence on the part of the defendant owner/occupier and its employees.

The defendant failed to show that it was free from negligence.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, there were two kinds of negligence asserted against the owner: (1) passive negligence or a static condition, i.e., the inability of the attendants to see from the top of the flume to the landing pool, the inadequacy of the visual or auditory warnings, and the lack of communications between the employees in each of these areas; and (2) active negligence by the employees, i.e., sending the rafts down the flume at unsafe intervals; failure to be at the landing to assist, instead of putting rafts on the conveyor belt; failure of the attendant to warn the plaintiff and her mother to remain seated after they reached the landing pool and to remain in the raft when plaintiff started to get out; and failure to warn of the approach of the second raft after plaintiff got out of the first raft and placed herself in a position of peril without realizing the imminent danger to herself.

Stores, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../317/4/index.html">263 Ga. 865</a></span>, 866 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../317/4/index.html">440 SE2d 193</a></span>) (1994). The majority fails to distinguish between these two distinct kinds of negligence and insists that the acts of the employees were not active negligence.</div><div class="casepar">The presence of the warning sign and the audio warning demonstrated fact questions as to whether there was a breach of the duty to warn adequately and specifically of known dangers by the owner/occupier of the existence of active, as well as passive, dangers and as to the adequacy of the warning. The giving of the warnings acknowledged the existence of dangers and risks, but failed to identify the dangers, so that patrons could exercise ordinary care for their own safety to avoid such identified dangers. The "warnings" were diluted into commands to do a specific thing to avoid any and all possible risks without revealing specifically those risks, as if given to young children, the usual patrons who were accustomed to obeying directions blindly. For all a reasonably prudent adult could perceive from the warnings given, such instructions were mere crowd control directions that were given to help management and not to protect the patrons. The content of the message totally failed to bring home to the receiver the appreciation that there were any specific dangers to guard against. The obvious reason for the inadequacy of warning was to dilute the message of danger and to cause a sense of well-being, instead of alarm and alertness to danger, in this place of family fun. Management did not want to scare patrons away from returning to this potentially dangerous place; adequate warnings would be very bad for business. Patrons who are frightened for their and their children's safety do not return.</div><div class="casepar">The act of sending the second raft down blindly and too close in time to the first raft and not having attendants at the landing pool to assist in the disembarkation raised factual questions as to the employees' active negligence. The acts of the attendants in loading the rafts onto the conveyor belt, instead of watching plaintiff's raft and warning her either to sit down and stay in the raft, or to look out for the second raft when it was about to hit her, raised issues of active negligence. See Lipham v. Federated Dept. Stores, supra. Plaintiff's evidence created material issues of fact as to whether or not White Water and its employees were negligent.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The second issue to be decided was whether or not the defendant made out a prima facie affirmative defense by proving through competent evidence each and every element of such affirmative defense, for which it had the burden of proof both at trial and on summary judgment.

Therefore, the plaintiff was, at most, comparatively negligent.</div><div class="casepar">"Comparative negligence by the plaintiff is that negligence which joins with the negligence of the defendant in proximately causing the injuries of the plaintiff and goes in reduction of the amount of recovery in proportion that the negligence of the plaintiff compares with that of the defendant, resulting, by reduction, in a bar of recovery when the negligence of the plaintiff is equal to or greater than that of the defendant." Whatley v. Henry, supra at 674.</div><div class="casepar">While plaintiff could see that the attendants were busy loading rafts 25 feet away and were not available to immediately help her get her mother out of the raft, the raft was unsteady as her mother attempted to stand. The only apparent danger appeared to her to be that either the raft would turn over with her mother standing up or that her mother would fall over the side of the raft. Plaintiff's mother's conduct immediately created a dangerous situation, which plaintiff could resolve in either of two ways: (1) her mother could sit back down and remain seated; however, the mother seemed to panic and could not be reasoned with, which reduced the feasibility of this alternative and her mother was an adult with a mind of her own; or (2) plaintiff could climb out and steady the tossing raft to prevent her mother's fall, which she did. The negligence of the attendant on top of the flume in launching the second raft too soon and without warning was not immediately apparent to plaintiff, although she may have reasonably anticipated such conduct. However, no one has a duty to anticipate the active negligence of another. Poppell v. Smutney, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../668/01/index.html">106 Ga.

Morgan, <span class="casemissing">54 Ga. App. 426 (188 SE 44) (1936)</span>, and other cases, appear to blend or merge the two concepts of avoidance and assumption of the risk when they are separate and distinct. Assumption of risk in its simplest and primary sense means that the plaintiff has given [her] express consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward [her] and to take [her] chance of injury from a known risk. Owens-Ill. v. Bryson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../570/40/index.html">138 Ga. App. 78</a></span>, 79 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../570/40/index.html">225 SE2d 475</a></span>) (1976). Also, plaintiff with knowledge of the risk may be regarded as tacitly or impliedly agreeing to take [her] own chances. Id. at p. 79. In working out the distinction, the courts have arrived at the conclusion that assumption of risk is a matter of knowledge of the danger and intelligent acquiescence in it. Roberts v. King, [<span class="casecite"><a href="../../677/91/index.html">102 Ga. App. 518</a></span>, 521 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../677/91/index.html">116 SE2d 885</a></span>) (1960)]. The doctrine of avoidable consequences does not rest upon the idea that defendant is relieved of any duty toward plaintiff, but denies recovery for any damages which could have been discovered by plaintiff or might have been avoided by reasonable conduct on plaintiff's part. Osborn v. Pilgrim, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../810/9/index.html">246 Ga. 688</a></span>, 695 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../810/9/index.html">273 SE2d 118</a></span>) (1980). Avoidance of the consequences involves the failure to take action to overcome defendant's negligence after it is discovered by plaintiff's exercise of ordinary care. Lanier v. Turner, <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. App. 749</span>, 753 (<span class="casemissing">38 SE2d 55</span>) (1946). The rule which requires one to avoid the consequences of another's negligence does not apply until [she] sees the danger or has reason to apprehend it. Central R. &amp;c. Co. v.

"The affirmative defense of assumption of the risk bars a plaintiff from recovering on a negligence claim if it is established that [she] without coercion of circumstances, chooses a course of action with full knowledge of its danger and while exercising a free choice as to whether to engage in the act or not. In Georgia, a defendant asserting an assumption of the risk defense must establish that the plaintiff (1) had actual knowledge of the danger; (2) understood and appreciated the risks associated with such danger; and (3) voluntarily exposed [herself] to those risks. Knowledge of the risk is the watchword of assumption of risk, and means both actual and subjective knowledge on the plaintiff's part. The knowledge that a plaintiff who assumes a risk must subjectively possess is that of the specific, particular risk of harm associated with the activity or condition that proximately causes injury. The knowledge requirement does not refer to a plaintiff's comprehension of general, non-specific risks that might be associated with such conditions or activities."

Thus, the Supreme Court has returned tort law to again requiring subjective knowledge and appreciation of the danger before the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk bars recovery; subjective knowledge and appreciation of the specific danger has not been shown in support of this motion for summary judgment and remains a question of fact for the jury. The majority chooses to ignore this requirement in order to affirm by reference to general awareness of danger, which the Supreme Court held was not adequate to prove assumption of the risk as a bar.</div><div class="casepar">While warnings of a kind existed in this case, the warnings were general in nature and not specific as to what dangers existed. The warning was that passengers should not attempt to get out of the raft; the warnings did not specify as the danger that the passenger could be struck by another raft; such warning could have caused a reasonable person to believe that the danger was tipping the raft or falling down or out of the raft, not being struck by another raft.

Turner v. Sumter Self Storage Co., supra at 94. The defendant in this case failed to make out a prima facie affirmative defense of assumption of the risk, because subjective knowledge of the specific danger and appreciation of such danger has not been shown. This was not a plain, palpable and undisputed evidence case, although the majority seeks to make it appear as such.</div><div class="casepar">(3) Plaintiff was confronted by what she perceived was a sudden emergency; her mother had attempted to get out of the raft, experienced problems, and seemed to panic. Therefore, a jury issue arose as to whether the facts and circumstances actually presented a sudden emergency and, if so, did she exercise ordinary care under the facts and circumstances of getting out to steady the raft, instead of making her mother sit down and wait for the attendants. The elderly mother created the situation; plaintiff merely reacted to her mother. In an emergency, one is not held to the same accuracy of judgment that would be required when there is more time for deliberation. Bass v. Seaboard Air Line R.

If plaintiff was, in fact, negligent and presented with a sudden emergency, then it was for a jury to determine whether or not plaintiff's negligence was the sole proximate cause of her injury, was equal to or greater than the negligence of the defendant, or was less than the negligence of the defendant. The jury would have to decide if this was an assumption of the risk which would negate the exception of sudden emergency or if it was ordinary negligence on the part of the plaintiff so that sudden emergency and comparative negligence would be applicable.</div><div class="casepar">Sudden emergency only applies to those acts immediately following a realization of peril or crisis and before there is time for mature reflection as to the safest course of conduct, thus it cannot apply when there was an assumption of the risk.
