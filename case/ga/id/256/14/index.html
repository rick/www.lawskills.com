DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Coursey</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This action involves Brian Realty Corporation's ("Brian Realty") request for a refund of 1992 ad valorem taxes paid on property located in DeKalb County. The superior court granted the county's motion for summary judgment and denied Brian Realty's motion for partial summary judgment. Brian Realty appealed, and for the following reasons, we reverse.</div><div class="casepar">"To prevail at summary judgment under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/56/index.html">9-11-56</a></span>, the moving party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the undisputed facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, warrant judgment as a matter of law. [Cit.]" Lau's Corp. v. Haskins, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../371/1/index.html">261 Ga. 491 (405 SE2d 474) (1991)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The record shows that in 1986, the owner of approximately 71.73 acres, known as the Perimeter Summit/Lake Hearn Development ("Lake Hearn Property"), sought to rezone the property from residential to office-institutional. The DeKalb County Board of Commissioners rezoned the property to "OI (conditional)," meaning office-institutional with conditions. One of the conditions imposed in 1986 required the owner to set aside approximately 23 acres for a perpetual conservation easement.</div><div class="casepar">The property sat untouched for several years until May 1991, when the new owner of the property, Dalford Associates, L.P. ("Dalford"), filed an "Application for Conditional Zoning Alteration." The county approved the change in conditions without altering the conditional O&amp;I zoning designation. The conditions affecting the property were listed in the county board of commissioners' minutes that authorized the change in conditions as well as on an attachment to the minutes. Included in this list of conditions was the 23-acre conservation easement, as well as the requirement that the owner set aside an additional 20 acres for a "10-year restricted area" conservation easement. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> These two zoning conditions provided that no development permits could be issued until the developer provided the DeKalb County Planning Commission with evidence that the conservation easements had been recorded with the superior court. The easements were not recorded with the superior court until May 1992.</div><div class="casepar">In assessing ad valorem taxes for 1992, the county valued the entire 71.73-acre tract as unimproved land zoned office-institutional. In 1993, after the easement documents were recorded, the county reassessed the taxes, taking into account the recorded easements. On February 8, 1994, the current owner of the Lake Hearn Property, Brian Realty, filed with the county a request under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> (b) for a refund of taxes paid for 1992, claiming the county failed to consider the zoning conditions requiring the easements that restricted Brian Realty's use of over 40 acres of the property. After a year passed with no resolution from the county concerning the request, Brian Realty filed suit in superior court pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> (c) seeking a refund of not less than $350,000. Brian Realty also raised a 42 USC  1983 claim, arguing that the "illegal assessment" denied Brian Realty its due process rights and amounted to an illegal taking.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants, DeKalb County and members of the DeKalb County Board of Tax Assessors (collectively "the county"), moved for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that Brian Realty's avenue of recourse was through the procedures of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span>, not OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span>. Brian Realty responded and moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a ruling that it was entitled to a refund because the county failed to consider the zoning conditions.</div><div class="casepar">In granting summary judgment to the county, the superior court ruled that "there was no error of fact on the tax records as of January 1, 1992 because the [Office &amp; Institutional] designation was correct and the easements were not yet recorded." The court concluded that while the zoning designation was a matter of fact, the zoning conditions were not. The court said how the easement conditions affected the value of the property was a matter of opinion. Relying on Gwinnett County Bd. of Tax Assessors v. Gwinnett I Ltd. Partnership, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../245/7/index.html">265 Ga. 645 (458 SE2d 632) (1995)</a></span>, the superior court ruled there was no viable action under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span>. Brian Realty appealed from this decision.</div><div class="casepar">1. Before addressing the merits of this appeal, we must consider whether Brian Realty was the real party in interest. The county argues that Brian Realty did not have standing to bring this tax appeal because Dalford was the owner of the property at the time of the 1992 assessment and the GE Pension Trust ("GE") paid the taxes</div><div class="casepar">on the property for Brian Realty.</div><div class="casepar">The record shows that while Dalford was listed as owner, it was a legally defunct limited partnership under Delaware law at that time because it only had one partner, Brian Realty. See 6 Del. Code  17-101 (8) (a limited partnership is a partnership formed by two or more persons). For purposes of winding up its affairs, Dalford quit-claimed all of its interest in the property to Brian Realty on April 10, 1992, which included any interest Dalford would have had to bring the refund action as the owner of the property.</div><div class="casepar">As for GE, although the taxes on the property were paid on checks issued by the trust, Brian Realty is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the trust, according to the GE trustee. GE's auditor further stated in an affidavit that GE is the sole shareholder of Brian Realty, and that the checks for the 1992 taxes were written on behalf of Brian Realty to pay Brian Realty's debts. The auditor stated the payments were assessed against Brian Realty's account, and were "included and deducted as property tax expense on the 1992 income tax returns for Brian Realty." Given the trustee's and auditor's statements, we are satisfied that Brian Realty is the "taxpayer" for purposes of seeking the refund. The county has not offered any evidence contradicting the fact that while GE actually issued the checks, Brian Realty actually paid the taxes since the expenses were charged against Brian Realty's account.</div><div class="casepar">Even if GE was a proper party to the suit, it is well established that "summary judgment cannot properly be granted to a defendant on the basis of a real-party-in-interest objection. [Cit.]" Dept. of Human Resources v. Holland, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../318/1/index.html">263 Ga. 885</a></span>, 887 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../318/1/index.html">440 SE2d 9</a></span>) (1994). The proper remedy is dismissal, but only after "a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in interest. . . ." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/17/index.html">9-11-17</a></span> (a).</div><div class="casepar">Finally, in that it is peripherally related to the question of the real party in interest, we address the county's argument that Brian Realty improperly assigned its interests in the refund action to a tax consulting firm, Winthrop &amp; Jones. This argument is contradicted by the clear terms of the agreement between Brian Realty and Winthrop &amp; Jones. Winthrop &amp; Jones was hired to pursue the tax refund on Brian Realty's behalf. The refund claim was not assigned in full to the consulting firm; rather, Winthrop &amp; Jones was only to receive a percentage of the amount of the refund it obtained for Brian Realty. Consequently, there was no improper assignment of the refund, which OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> (b) prohibits.</div><div class="casepar">2. We now turn to the merits of Brian Realty's appeal to determine whether it properly pursued its tax refund claim under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span>. In Gwinnett, supra, the Supreme Court of Georgia delineated the differences between the procedures for appealing ad valorem taxes under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span> and those under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span>. The court held that "while the appeal process of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span> is available to address any asserted error in an ad valorem real property tax assessment, the refund process established by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> is intended only to correct errors of fact or law which have resulted in erroneous or illegal taxation." Id. at 646-647. "If the taxpayer alleges that the assessment is based on matters of fact in the record which are inaccurate, or that the assessment was reached by the use of illegal procedures, then the taxpayer has asserted a claim that the taxes were 'erroneously or illegally assessed and collected,' which is what [OCGA]  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> addresses. A claim based on mere dissatisfaction with an assessment . . . is not . . . one which asserts that an assessment is erroneous or illegal within the meaning of [OCGA]  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span>." Id. at 647.</div><div class="casepar">For ad valorem tax purposes, "[a]ll property shall be returned for taxation at its fair market value. . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/6/index.html">48-5-6</a></span>. The county's tax assessor was required to ascertain the fair market value of Brian Realty's property, which is the "amount a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the property and a willing seller would accept for the property at an arm's length, bona fide sale." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/2/index.html">48-5-2</a></span> (3). Among other factors to be considered in determining fair market value, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/2/index.html">48-5-2</a></span> (3) (B) (i) provides that the tax assessors shall consider "[e]xisting zoning of property." (Emphasis supplied.) "Existing zoning of property" would include conditional zoning, which has been ruled valid in Georgia. See Warshaw v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../687/2/index.html">250 Ga. 535</a></span>, 536 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../687/2/index.html">299 SE2d 552</a></span>) (1983); Cross v. Hall County, <span class="casemissing">238 Ga. 709</span>, 712 (2) (<span class="casemissing">235 SE2d 379</span>) (1977).</div><div class="casepar">The county argues that it was not appropriate to consider the easement conditions until they were recorded with the superior court. The county is correct in pointing out that once conservation easements, as imposed here, are recorded, the property owner has a right to have his property reassessed pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/10/5/index.html">44-10-5</a></span> (currently OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/10/8/index.html">44-10-8</a></span>). However, that does not mean that prior to recordation of the conservation easements, the zoning conditions requiring the easements do not affect the fair market value of the property for ad valorem tax purposes.</div><div class="casepar">We agree with the superior court that no action under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> would lie if the tax assessors considered the conditions in making the assessment, for how the conditions affect the property's value is a matter of opinion, not an inaccurate matter of fact. See Gwinnett, supra. However, if the tax assessors totally failed to consider the existing conditional zoning in ascertaining value, as mandated by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/2/index.html">48-5-2</a></span>, then "the assessment was reached by the use of illegal procedures . . . ," for which a refund action would lie. Id. at 647. Brian Realty's claim is not based on "mere dissatisfaction with an assessment . . . ," but rather on an alleged error of law resulting in erroneous or illegal taxation. Id.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, an issue of fact remains concerning whether the county's tax assessor considered the existing zoning conditions in making the assessment, and as such, summary judgment to the county regarding Brian Realty's claim under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> was not appropriate. Lau's Corp., supra.</div><div class="casepar">3. The superior court correctly granted summary judgment to the county on Brian Realty's 42 USC  1983 claim, as there was an adequate remedy under Georgia law. See Gwinnett County Bd. of Tax Assessors v. Network Publications, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/03/index.html">208 Ga. App. 15</a></span>, 17 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../316/03/index.html">429 SE2d 696</a></span>) (1993). The procedures of either OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/311/index.html">48-5-311</a></span> or  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/48/5/380/index.html">48-5-380</a></span> provide Brian Realty with a full hearing and a judicial determination at which it could raise any and all constitutional objections to the tax. See id.</div><div class="casepar">4. Furthermore, there was no illegal taking of the Lake Hearn property, as Brian Realty maintains. Brian Realty and its predecessors in interest were aware of and agreed to the zoning conditions. The county did not remove land from Brian Realty's possession for public use. The only "taking" of which Brian Realty is complaining is its overpayment of taxes due to the county's assessment. Just as we held in Parian Lodge v. DeKalb County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/13/index.html">225 Ga. App. 853</a></span>, 855-856 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../268/13/index.html">485 SE2d 545</a></span>) (1997), no legal basis exists for a claim that payment of the ad valorem tax amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property.</div><div class="casepar">Carothers &amp; Mitchell, Richard A.
