The notice to produce certain documents was directed to Mrs. Lucille Day in her individual capacity, and not to her in her representative capacity as natural guardian of the plaintiff in error; therefore the court erred in denying tile motion to quash the motion to produce.</div><div class="casepar">2. Neither the defendant in error nor her attorney complied with Code (Ann.)  38-806 prior to the court's peremptory order directing the plaintiff in error to produce instanter; consequently the court erred in passing the peremptory order, and when such order was unresponded to, in declaring the case in default and in entering a judgment for the defendant in error accordingly.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. William C. Burns, Sr., as widow of William C. Burns, Sr., applied to the Whitfield Court of Ordinary for the appointment of appraisers to set apart for her and her minor child, Danny L. Burns, a year's support from the estate of the deceased. The appraisers' return set aside certain named property as a year's support. William C. Burns, Jr., by his mother and natural guardian, Mrs. Lucille Day, filed his caveat to the return. The court of ordinary set aside the appraisers' return and allowed one-fourth of the deceased's estate to the caveator and the remainder of the estate to the applicant and her minor child. Both the applicant and the caveator appealed from this judgment to the Whitfield Superior Court. After both sides had announced ready and a jury was stricken and the witnesses for both parties were sworn, the applicant called upon "Mrs. Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr.," to respond to a notice to produce. Mrs. Day, as natural guardian for the caveator, moved to quash the notice to produce, as follows: "Now comes Mrs. Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr., with reference to notice to produce served upon Isaac C. Adams, attorney, by attorney for applicant in the above matter, directed 'to Mrs. Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr.,' and moves the court to quash said notice to produce the matters called for therein in the Superior Court of Whitfield County, Georgia, at April term, upon the following grounds: 1. The said motion affirmatively shows that same originated from another court and with reference to matter pending in another court at the time of said notice to produce, and therefore compliance cannot be required in this court under these circumstances. 2. That the said Mrs. Lucille Day, upon whom said notice was served, is not a party to said proceeding, and therefore a notice to produce is not effective and proper. 3. The things called for in the notice to produce are not described as provided by law. 4. That the real party in said contest is William C. Burns, Jr., and not Mrs. Lucille Day, she appearing only in her representative capacity as natural guardian. 5. The notice to produce affirmatively shows that Mrs. Lucille Day could not have received or executed any of the alleged papers at said time, since the notice affirmatively shows that William C. Burns, Sr., and father of William C. Burns, Jr., was his then natural guardian." This motion was overruled and the caveator excepted pendente lite. The court then passed an order calling on "Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr.," to produce instanter the documents called for in the notice to produce. To this order the caveator excepted pendente lite on the grounds that Mrs. Burns, or her agent, did not make oath that she had reason to believe that the document required was or had been in existence; that it was in the possession, power, or control of Mrs. Day; and that it was material to the issue; nor did Mrs. Burns' attorney so state in his place. Prior to the court's signing of the above order to produce instanter, the applicant introduced in evidence the application for a year's support and the appointment and return of the appraisers, and moved for a directed verdict. The court then ruled that, since the case was in default by reason of the peremptory order being unresponded to, the caveator could not offer evidence to contest the amount of the year's support and would not allow the caveator to offer evidence. To this ruling the caveator excepted pendente lite. The court then directed a verdict in favor of the return of the appraisers and passed the following order: "It appearing to the</div><div class="casepar">court that Mrs. Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr., has failed and refused to produce papers material to this case after a peremptory order of this court, and applicant leaving made a motion for judgment by default, it is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the return of the appraisers and the verdict of the jury be made the judgment of this court." To this judgment and by exceptions pendente lite the caveator excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The plaintiff in error contends that the court erred in overruling his motion to quash the notice to produce because that notice was directed to Mrs. Lucille Day as an individual and not as natural guardian of the plaintiff in error. The contention is meritorious. The notice to produce was directed to "Mrs. Lucille Day, natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr." The description, "natural guardian of William C. Burns, Jr.," was merely descriptio personae, and the notice was therefore directed to Mrs. Day individually and not in her representative capacity of natural guardian. Owsley &amp; Son v. Woolhopter, <span class="casemissing">14 Ga. 124 (1)</span>; Armour Packing Co. v. Lovell, <span class="casemissing">118 Ga. 164</span> (144 S. E. 990); Stephens v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 666</span> (46 S. E. 872); Woodward v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">138 Ga. 751</span> (76 S. E. 49); Stubbs v. Fourth National Bank of Macon, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. App. 539</span> (1, 1a) (77 S. E. 893); Nolin v. Mooty, <span class="casemissing">29 Ga. App. 97 (1)</span> (113 S. E. 814); Sudderth v. Harris, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 654</span> (181 S. E. 122). The motion to quash should have been sustained.</div><div class="casepar">2. The court passed a peremptory order to produce instanter and when the plaintiff in error failed to respond thereto, the court declared the case to be in default and entered a judgment for the defendant in error accordingly. This was error. Code (Ann.)  38-806 provides: "Before the notice provided for in the preceding section shall be available, the party giving it, or his agent, must make oath (or his attorney state in his place) that he has reason to believe that the paper required is or has been in existence; that it is in the possession, power or control of the person notified; and that it is material to the issue." This Code section was not complied with by the defendant in error or her attorney, and the court therefore erred in passing the peremptory order to produce instanter. Georgia Iron &amp; Coal Co. v. Etowah Iron Co., <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 395 (4)</span> (30 S. E. 878); Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Hollis, <span class="casemissing">23 Ga. App. 634 (2)</span> (99 S. E. 154).</div><div class="casepar">We do not rule on whether the court would have been authorized to declare the case in default under the facts of this case if Code (Ann.)  38-806 had been complied with by the defendant in error or her attorney.</div><div class="casepar">The consequences of a failure to produce are drastic indeed, and therefore the requirements prerequisite to such consequences are likewise drastic. The party giving the notice must subject himself to criminal prosecution if his affidavit is untrue, and his attorney must subject himself to a citation for contempt and possibly other disciplinary action if his statement in his place is untrue. It was said by way of obiter in Parish v. Weed Sewing Machine Co., <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. 682</span> (7 S. E. 138), that the presumption that a fact continued to exist from proof that it once existed was not permissible in such a case. Even if this rule could be applied, there was only evidence that "an agreement" existed between the deceased father and his first wife, Mrs. Day, with reference to alimony and the caveator's support. There was no evidence that it was in writing or still in existence.</div><div class="casepar">The court erred in overruling the motion to quash the notice to produce, in passing the peremptory order to produce instanter, in declaring the case in default, and in entering a judgment for the defendant in error on that theory.</div><div class="casepar">Judgments reversed.
