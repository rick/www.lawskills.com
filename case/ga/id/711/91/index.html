A charge, in the trial of a defendant for assault with intent to rape, to the effect that in determining intent, differences in racial and social standings and customs may be considered, is proper only where one of the issues in the case is whether the female alleged to have been assaulted would have consented to the act of sexual intercourse, and such consent, or the likelihood thereof, is urged in defense. Where consent is not an issue, such charge is error.</div><div class="casepar">2. The remaining special grounds are without merit. The general grounds of the motion for new trial are not now passed upon, as the case is to be tried again.</div><div class="casepar">Buddy Sharpe was indicted, tried, and convicted in the Superior Court of Montgomery County for assault with intent to rape. Upon the trial, the evidence for the State was to the effect: that the prosecutrix, her husband, and two children slept in two double beds in the same bedroom, the wife and one child in one bed, and the husband and another child in the other bed; that the husband awoke between 1:30 and 3 a.m. on the night in question because of hearing his wife's screams; that the wife was sitting on the edge of the bed and the defendant had hold of her arm and had "busted open" her head with a blow from some instrument, causing it to bleed; that he immediately recognized the defendant and grappled with him; that they fought all over the house, the witness receiving a cut and several blows and the defendant several blows; that the defendant then made his escape; that it was a moonlight night, there were tracks under the bedroom window, and the defendant by looking through the window could have seen the prosecutrix lying in bed.</div><div class="casepar">The following morning a posse went to the defendant's house where he lived with his parents; the defendant was in the field, and on seeing the officers took flight. All of these events took place in 1937; the defendant was not apprehended and tried until 1953. Upon conviction he made a motion for new trial on the general grounds, which was later amended by adding four special grounds, and the denial of this motion is assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. In the first special ground of the amended motion for new trial, error is assigned on the charge of the court as follows: "In determining intent, differences in racial and social standings and customs may be considered." This portion of the charge is taken in essence, if not verbatim, from a charge in Jackson v. State, <span class="casemissing">91 Ga. 322 (2)</span> (18 S. E. 132, 44 A. L. R. 25), on a trial involving a like offense. The language used by the court in that case was approved in an opinion written by Chief Justice Bleckley, as follows: "The doctrine of the court's charge to the jury that, upon the question of intention, social customs founded on race differences, and the fact that the man was a negro and the girl a white person, might be taken into consideration, is undoubtedly correct. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that the girl was not virtuous, or that she had held out any encouragement to this negro, or to any other person, white or black, to enter her bedroom for illicit intercourse . . . Surely it was legitimate for the jury to note any departure from the customary modes of visiting which was involved in a nocturnal entrance by a negro man into the bedroom of a white woman during the hours usually devoted to sleep. The difference of sex, to say nothing of the difference of race, would afford ample ground for directing attention to this element of the case." In the Jackson case the negro entered the room of the girl, sat on her bed, called her name, and touched her foot. The question of identity was not involved, nor the question of intent to commit some crime other than rape, but only whether the intention might have been (a) to pay a visit for some lawful purpose, (b) to obtain the girl's consent to intercourse, or (c) to rape her.</div><div class="casepar">In Dorsey v. State, <span class="casemissing">108 Ga. 477</span>, 480 (34 S. E. 135), a case of assault with intent to rape, which was reversed by the Supreme Court by a divided bench, the following was stated in regard to the Jackson case and the subject matter of this charge: "The fact that the alleged assailant is a negro may, in cases like the one now under consideration, be properly considered for one purpose, and that is, to rebut any presumption that might otherwise arise in favor of the accused that his intention was to obtain the consent of the female, upon failure of which he would abandon his purpose to have sexual intercourse with her. Under the conditions surrounding the two races in this State, when in the trial of a person charged with assault with intent to commit a rape the only theory of the defense is that the accused intended to have sexual intercourse but it was his purpose to desist if he met with opposition, if the assailant is a negro and the female is a white woman, such a theory will avail nothing unless the evidence shows either that the female was not a virtuous woman, or that she had in some way encouraged the approaches of her assailant. The vital question, however, to be considered is whether, under the circumstances of the particular case, a negro could reasonably be presumed to have thought that a white woman would consent to his lustful embraces; and no such inference will ever arise in his favor, unless the circumstances are such that no other inference can be possibly drawn. The ruling in the case of Jackson v. State, <span class="casemissing">91 Ga. 322</span>, is to the above effect, but it goes no farther. No decision of this court has ever been made in which it was held that evidence of the character relied on for a conviction in the present case was sufficient to convict one of the offense for which the accused was charged." The evidence in the Dorsey case was to the effect that the negro in question, with a pistol in his hand, sprang up from behind some bushes beside the road where the accused was walking alone, and said, "I have got you where I have wanted you for a long time." In Pickett v. State, <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. App. 478</span> (186 S. E. 206), the prosecutrix, while walking along a path was grabbed around the neck by the defendant; she screamed and he ran away. The court reversed the conviction in that case and, following the ruling in the Dorsey case, held that the Jackson case went no further than a situation where the defendant, a negro, sets up that he intended to have sexual intercourse with a white woman, but it was his purpose to desist if he met with opposition, and that such theory would avail nothing unless it was shown that the woman was not virtuous, or that she had encouraged the approaches of her assailant.</div><div class="casepar">In Harper v. State, <span class="casemissing">74 Ga. App. 479</span> (40 S. E. 2d 222), this court, after analyzing the evidence to show that under the testimony any question as to assault with intent to rob, murder, or commit any felony other than rape, had been eliminated front consideration, stated: "This then left but one question for the jury to determine, and that was, whether he intended to effectuate this purpose forcibly and against her will. The jury were authorized in the determination of this question to consider the difference in the races, the customs," etc. (Emphasis added.)</div><div class="casepar">That the case is a close one on its facts cannot be questioned, insofar at least, as the question of intent is concerned. See, in this connection, Jackson v. State, supra; Dorsey v. State, supra; Johnson v. State, <span class="casemissing">63 Ga. 355</span>; Carter v. State, <span class="casemissing">35 Ga. 263</span>; Parker v. State, <span class="casemissing">72 Ga. App. 302</span> (33 S. E. 2d 739); McCullough v. State, <span class="casemissing">11 Ga. App. 612</span> (76 S. E. 393); Pickett v. State, supra. In such a case, where under no phase of the evidence is the question of consent involved, such charge is error, and where the question as to intent is far from clear, it must be held to be harmful error, since the jury might have construed the charge, that "in determining intent, differences in racial and social standings and customs may be considered," to mean that difference in racial or social standing would authorize them to conclude that the intent was an intent to rape rather than an intent to rob, injure, murder, or to commit some other felony upon the person of the victim. Accordingly, a reversal is demanded upon this ground.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 2 of the amended motion for new trial is abandoned. In special ground 3 error is assigned on the court's remark as to certain evidence, "I don't see that that's got anything to do with the case"; and, as to other evidence, "That's not material." These statements during the progress of the trial do not appear to have been rulings on objections to evidence insofar as this record shows. If considered as expressions of opinion, they are not before this court since no objection or motion for a mistrial was made at the time. These exceptions are therefore without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. The general grounds are not passed upon, as this case is to be tried again.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Roger H.
