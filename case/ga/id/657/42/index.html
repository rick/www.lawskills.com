Gwinnett County v. Archer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../678/80/index.html">102 Ga.

(b) They negotiated an agreement with Buchanan that in exchange for his promise that Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., would pay to them personally sums equal to four percent of the payments made by Gwinnett County to Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., for the construction of said water system they would go forward with the establishment of said water system and the performance of said construction contract. (c) They provided further in said agreement with Buchanan that such payments would be made to them secretly and in cash and installments following receipt by Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., of payments to it under the provisions of said construction contract." That in January 1956 the defendants issued and sold in the name of Gwinnett County revenue anticipation bonds in order to obtain funds for the performance of the construction contract and establishment of the water system; that "The proceeds of the sale of said revenue anticipation bonds constituted a trust fund for the construction and establishment of said water system and defendant commissioners were trustees and fiduciaries thereto. Thereafter, during the year 1956, defendants, as the governing authority of Gwinnett County, paid to Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., pursuant to said construction contract and said conspiracy and agreement with Buchanan, sums aggregating $3,918,737.78. Pursuant to said conspiracy and his said agreement to make payment to the defendants, Buchanan paid to defendants for their own personal gain and enrichment the total sum of $159,073.08. Said payments were made, secretly and in cash, in the amounts and on the approximate dates shown in Exhibit "A" which is attached hereto and made a part of this petition; and all of said sums were received and retained by defendants pursuant to said fraudulent and unlawful conspiracy. Plaintiff does not know and therefore cannot allege what division of said payments were made by defendants among themselves"; that the defendants acted in violation of the Constitution and statutes of Georgia found in Code  2-5606, 26-4202, 4-205 and 108-429; and "since the establishment of said water system was a public function, since said system was public property of Gwinnett County, since the proceeds of said revenue anticipation bonds constituted a trust fund, and since defendant commissioners were trustees and fiduciaries, all of the defendants were required by law to exercise the utmost good faith, fidelity, and integrity in dealing with said money. It was the duty of defendants in dealing with the property and money of plaintiff county to get the best available price for the construction of said water system; and if defendants had not entered into and carried out said unlawful and fraudulent conspiracy, as shown above, and if they had exercised the good faith, fidelity and integrity required of them by law, plaintiff county could have reduced the cost of said water system by the amounts paid to defendants by Buchanan. In May 1958 plaintiff employed an investigator to attempt to discover any fraudulent or unlawful conduct on the part of any person, public or private, in connection with the establishment of said water system. On March 12, 1959, defendant F. P. Dover denied to said investigator that he had received any payments from Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., or Paul A. Buchanan, Jr.; and on April 29, 1959, defendant Weldon B. Archer made a similar denial. On April 3, 1959, defendant O. D. Cain refused to discuss with said investigator the said water system or any matters or things connected with it. Plaintiff county was unable, notwithstanding its diligent and reasonable efforts, to discover the facts alleged herein regarding said conspiracy and the payments made to defendants by Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., or information sufficient to lead to the discovery of such facts, until subsequent to January 1, 1962. In failing to carry out their lawful obligation to protect and preserve the property and funds of Gwinnett County and in concealing said conspiracy and the payments made to them by Buchanan Pipe Line Company, Inc., all as alleged above, defendants are guilty of fraud and moral turpitude which deterred plaintiff from proceeding against them for such wrongful and unlawful conduct. The conduct</div><div class="casepar">of defendants as alleged above constitutes a breach of trust and a tort upon Gwinnett County which, as a proximate result thereof, sustained actual damages of $159,073.08."</div><div class="casepar">The defendants demurred to such petition on the grounds that it set forth no cause of action and that it was barred by the statute of limitation. The trial court overruled such demurrers and the defendants now assign error on such judgment adverse to them.</div><div class="casepar">1. The defendants in their brief state that the sole question for decision is whether the action was barred by the statute of limitation. Accordingly, the question as to whether the petition set forth a cause of action is treated as having been abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">2. The defendants rely upon Gwinnett County v. Archer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../678/80/index.html">102 Ga. App. 821</a></span>, 824 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../678/80/index.html">118 SE2d 102</a></span>), and Cook v. Commissioners of Houston County, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. 223</span>, to support their contention that the statute of limitation began to run against the county when the terms of office of the defendants expired on December 31, 1956, which was more than four years prior to the time the action was filed. In the first cited case it was held: "The theory that the limitation of four years commences at the expiration of the term of office of a public official is that it is on that date that he relinquishes and returns his office and public funds to the public body, and it is from that date that the public body can ascertain if wrong has been perpetrated. The distinguishing factor seems to be that if the public official is not only guilty of intentional breach of public duty, but is also guilty of fraud and concealment in connection with public moneys, the statute of limitations begins at the expiration of his tend of office." In the second cited case, p. 233, the Supreme Court laid down the rule that the statute started running from the date the officer returned his public office to the governing body, and in such case it was held: "Though it appears that the claims of Cook were false and fraudulent, yet it does not appear from the auditor's report, or otherwise, that there was any concealment or artifice used by Cook to cover up or hide the nature of his transactions and prevent investigation or suit. In other words, he was not guilty of any fraud by which the complainants were debarred or deterred from commencing their suit at an earlier period, so as to prevent the running of the statute on this ground. Code, section 2931 [Code  3-807]."</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, according to the allegations of the petition, there were actions on the part of the defendants to conceal and hide the transactions which would prevent the statute of limitation from attaching until 1962. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in overruling the ground of demurrer which sought to have the case dismissed because the petition showed on its face that the statute of limitation had run.</div><div class="casepar">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</div><div class="casepar">Under the decision of the Supreme Court in Cook v. Commissioners of Houston County, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. 223</span>, supra, the statute of limitation does not begin to run in a case against a public official for fraud coupled with concealment thereof until the fraud is discovered, and any holding contrary thereto in Gwinnett County v. Archer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../678/80/index.html">102 Ga.
