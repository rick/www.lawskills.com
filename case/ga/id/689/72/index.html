Dougherty Superior Court. Before Judge Crow. January 20, 1958.</div><div class="casepresiding">TOWNSEND, Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">A policy of automobile liability insurance covering the insured "within the boundaries of any Federal Reservation" covers one who is sued as the result of a collision within the limits a United States Air Force Base as shown by a plat stipulated to be a true and correct map of the base, although it occurs on a road located on the base the title to which, while vested in the United States Government, is subject to an easement in favor of the traveling public, and which road is in fact maintained and patrolled by county rather than military authorities.</div><div class="casepar">Georgia Casualty &amp; Surety Company filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Dougherty County against its insured, Coe D. Haynes and others. Haynes was the defendant in various actions for personal injuries growing out of a collision between his automobile and that of the codefendant Coombs, in which the codefendants McKnight, Thornton and Tallent were riding. Various actions were filed against Haynes in the City Court of Albany as a result of this collision, and the insurance company seeks to have its liability as to such lawsuits adjudicated in this action.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleges that the plaintiff had, at the time of the collision, issued a policy of liability insurance to Haynes the endorsement on which states the following: "Military Posts, Camps or Cantonments--Limited Coverage. In consideration of the premium charged, it is understood and agreed that coverage under this policy is to apply only to accidents which occur within the boundaries of any Federal Reservation." From the admissions in pleading and facts stipulated the following appears: Haynes, at the time of the issuance of this policy and the subsequent collision was in the military service stationed at Turner Air Force Base; by two deeds the City of Albany conveyed to the United States Government Land Lot 192 located in Dougherty County with a general warranty of title "subject to existing easements for public road and highways, for public utilities, for railroad and pipe lines" and the City of Albany further quitclaims to the grantee "all right, title and interest which it may have in any alleys, roads, streets, ways, strips, gores, or railroad and transmission line rights-of-way abutting or adjoining said land in any means of ingress or egress appurtenant thereto." The south line of Land Lot 192 forms the south side of a 100-foot right-of-way on which is located Old Cordele Road, a public road entirely within Land Lot 192, and which has been paved by Dougherty County subsequent to the installation of Turner Air Force Base and upon which the county maintains signs and traffic signals. Old Cordele Road intersects Turner Field Access Road which runs north and south along the west line of Land Lot 192 and which is also entirely within Land Lot 192, the southwest corner of the intersection of the rights-of-way being the southwest corner of the land lot. From the plat admitted in evidence and stipulated to be a true and correct map of the property owned in fee simple by the United States, it appears also that there is a fence along part of the southerly portion of the area, which fence is about 400 feet north of Old Cordele Road at its point nearest the road and makes an arc intersecting Turner Field Access Road about 1000 feet north of the intersection of the access road and Old Cordele Road, at which point there is a gate through which those desiring to enter the base must pass. Military personnel patrol regularly on the inside of the fence, from whence they have a view of the road, and a part of the patrol duty is to watch and report any unusual activity on the road. They also cut grass and, perform like duties between the fence and the road pavement. Under Air Force Regulations the Provost Marshal has certain duties relative to traffic including registration of private vehicles with evidence of insurance on such vehicles if the installation commander requires minimum insurance coverage. In order to be admitted through the gate of the fenced area of Turner Air Force Base, the installation commander required insurance in the amount of coverage issued under this policy. The intersection of Old Cordele Road and Turner Air Force Base Access Road is patrolled by the Dougherty County Police Department, and charges for violations of State traffic laws are made in the State courts.</div><div class="casepar">The court hearing the case on the above stipulation of facts and without the intervention of a jury entered a judgment holding that the insurance policy issued by the plaintiff to the defendant Coe D. Haynes was in full force and effect on July 15, 1957, and covered this defendant as to the collision occurring on that date at the intersection of Turner Access Road and Old Cordele Road. The exception is to this judgment.</div><div class="casepar"> The sole question at issue is whether the intersection of the two roads at the southwest corner of Land Lot 192 (title to which was in the United States Government) lies within "the boundaries of any Federal reservation." The parties have stipulated that the plat of Turner Air Force Base introduced in evidence is true and correct, and the legend thereon shows the boundaries of the air force base as reaching, not to the fence, but to the land lot lines. Accordingly, the evidence demands a finding that the intersection is within such boundaries.</div><div class="casepar">The briefs of both the plaintiff and defendants in error raise a number of intricate questions, and this decision, stated so baldly, does little credit to their research. This nevertheless appears to be a case controlled by a very simple issue of fact. We have examined the cession statutes in Chapter 15-3 of the Code, but feel that the rights of the State, especially in regard to civil and criminal jurisdiction, have no relevancy in interpreting this insurance policy. No question is made but that the City of Albany, at the time it deeded the land to the United States, was the owner thereof. All that it did not own was an easement vested in the public, presumably by user, for the purpose of travel over Old Cordele Road. The municipality could not and did not attempt to abolish this easement, and it sold the land subject thereto. The land traversed by the road remains the property of the owner ( Stewart County v. Holloway, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 344</span>, 25 S. E. 2d 315) and the easement refers only to a right of passage ( Smith v. City Council of Rome, <span class="casemissing">19 Ga. 89</span>, 65 Am. D. 298). That the public has a right of user in no wise prevents that part of the property of the United States Government owned and claimed by it from being a part of the military reservation as the plat shows it to be. Nor does it matter whether the authorities saw fit to erect a fence and gate at the entrance to the property, or 1,000 feet within it, or 5,000 feet within it, for the purpose of checking traffic at any point on the base where they might desire to do so. They might not, perhaps, have found it feasible to erect a fence and gate which would block the road entirely as this might interfere wish an existing easement; such fact does not ipso facto prove that the road is not a part of the reservation as contended. From the plat it does not appear that the fence is intended as the boundary for anything in particular and it certainly does not purport to circle Turner Air Force Base so as to divide it from the other land also owned by the United States, but, on the contrary, all of the land is represented on the plat as being within the reservation.</div><div class="casepar">It is further contended that the obvious intent of this policy is to furnish only that protection required by the installation commander, that is, protection inside the fenced area. This, too, is a non sequitur. The commander could just as well have required the insurance whether a fence was erected across the road or not, or he might have set up a check point for automobiles on the reservation at any other place where he deemed it advantageous to do so. The policy did not limit its coverage to that part of the reservation designated by the commander, but rather extends to the boundaries thereof. Regarding the contention that a military post is by definition "the fixed locality or stretch of ground guarded and patrolled by a sentry or outpost", it need only be said that there is considerable stretch of ground, as shown by the plat, between the road right-of-way and the fence at the southern side of the field; this court could hardly be so presumptuous as to hold that the United States Government had abandoned this ground as a part of its military post simply because the area is patrolled from the inside rather than the outside of the fence. Nor are the relative jurisdictions of State and county police on the one hand and the provost marshals on the other at issue here, since we are dealing with insurance coverage limited by the ownership and boundaries of the base, and not with the respective rights of the various governing authorities as between each other.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in entering up a declaratory judgment against the plaintiff.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Smith, Gardner &amp; Kelley, Asa D.
