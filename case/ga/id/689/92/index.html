Laurens Superior Court. Before Judge Stephens. January 28, 1958.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On June 17, 1953, Stinson's Garage, Inc., a corporation (hereinafter called the plaintiff corporation) sued out a purchase money attachment against Jack Powell (hereinafter called the defendant) returnable to the July 1953 term of the Superior Court of Laurens County. This bond was based on an affidavit made by Murray Stinson. The affidavit alleged that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff corporation in the sum of $2,110.15 as the purchase money of one Chrysler 1951 model automobile. The purported bond reads as follows: "State of Georgia--Laurens County. The undersigned, principal and surety, acknowledge themselves bound unto the defendant named in the foregoing affidavit in the sum of $4,220 subject to the following conditions: That the said principal Stinson Garage, Inc., is seeking an attachment against the said obligee Jack Powell herein; which is now about to be sued out, returnable to the July term 1953 of the superior court of said county. Now, if the said principal shall pay all damages that the said obligee may sustain, and all costs that may be incurred by him in consequence of suing out such attachment, in the event that said principal shall fail to recover in said case, then this bond to be void. "(Principal /s/ Murray Stinson (L.S.) </div><div class="casepar">"Executed this 17 day of June 1953, in presence of </div><div class="casepar">"/s/ G. L. Hattaway, </div><div class="casepar">N. P. &amp; Ex Off., J. P."</div><div class="casepar">It will be noted that the bond was signed by Murray Stinson as principal and W. B. Tarpley as security. Based on such purported bond a writ of attachment was issued on June 18, 1953, and levied on the described 1951 automobile which purportedly was at the time in the possession of Jack Powell. In due course the plaintiff corporation filed its declaration in attachment returnable to the July term 1953 and the defendant filed a traverse to the said attachment. During the pendency of the case the defendant filed an answer to the declaration and also a cross-action against the plaintiff corporation.</div><div class="casepar">The case came on for trial on January 28, 1958, on the issues made by the plaintiff corporation's attachment and the defendant's traverse. The defendant, on the call of the case for trial and before proceeding to trial filed a written motion to dismiss the attachment, in the nature of a general demurrer, on the ground that it showed on its face that the attachment was void because the plaintiff corporation had failed to execute and give the bond required by law for the purpose of obtaining the attachment and that the purported bond upon which the attachment was based was void and therefore the entire attachment proceeding was wholly null and void. The plaintiff corporation, on the same date, filed an amendment to the attachment whereby it was sought to substitute a new and different bond in the name of the plaintiff corporation in lieu of the original purported attachment bond. Counsel for the defendant objected to the allowance of the tendered amendment on the ground that there was no bond to be amended; that the purported bond given as an original bond was not amendable as a matter of law and that the tendered amended bond did not comply with the law as to security thereon and did not afford the defendant legal security as a basis for the original issuance of the said attachment. The court overruled the defendant's objection to the proffered amendment, allowed the bond to be amended and overruled the defendant's written motion to dismiss the attachment on each and all of the grounds of the motion. The written motion to dismiss, in the nature of a general demurrer, reads: "1. Because it shows on its face that said attachment is void. 2. Because the plaintiff corporation, who is the plaintiff in attachment, failed to execute or give the bond required by the mandatory provisions of law, for the purpose of obtaining said attachment. 3. Because the purported bond, upon which the purported attachment was based and issued, shows on its face that it is no obligation or bond of the plaintiff in attachment, and that it amounts to no bond at all, of any kind or character, in that it was not executed in the name of, for or in behalf of the plaintiff corporation, and that no attachment bond had in fact been given before the issuing and levy of the said attachment. 4. For the aforesaid reasons, the said attachment writ, attachment bond, and the entire attachment proceeding, is wholly and utterly null and void."</div><div class="casepar">The exceptions taken by the defendant Powell in the bill of exceptions are (1) to the court's allowance of the plaintiff corporation's amendment to the purported attachment, and (2) to the court's overruling of the defendant's written motion to dismiss the attachment on all of the grounds set forth therein.</div><div class="casepar"> Code  8-111 reads: "The party seeking the attachment shall, before the same issues, also give bond, with good security, in an amount at least double the debt sworn to, payable to the defendant in attachment, conditioned to pay such defendant all damages that he may sustain and also all costs that may be incurred by him in consequence of suing out the attachment, in the event the plaintiff shall fail to recover in said case; which bond it shall be the duty of the magistrate or other officer before whom the affidavit is made to take . . ." See also Code  8-303. The requirements of Code  8-111 are mandatory and prerequisite requirements to the issuance of an attachment. There was attached to the affidavit in this case and as a part of the attachment proceedings a purported bond executed by Murray Stinson, an individual, and with W. B. Tarpley, an individual as security, as shown in the bond which we have quoted hereinabove. This was an individual undertaking of Murray Stinson and W. B. Tarpley. It was not and did not purport to be an obligation or undertaking of the corporation, Stinson's Garage, Inc., as required by law. If the bond had been given or made by the corporation as the plaintiff in attachment or executed in its name or behalf by the proper officers of the corporation and there had been some defect in the bond such as omission of the name of the obligee, or the incorrect amount of the penalty, or some inadvertent typographical error therein, these things could have been amended under the provisions of Code  8-610.</div><div class="casepar">In Copeland &amp; Co. v. Monroe, <span class="casemissing">16 Ga. App. 586</span> (85 S. E. 789) this court said: "A defective attachment bond is amendable, but a paper purporting to be such a bond, signed by a plaintiff firm as principal and with no other security than a member of the partnership which had signed the bond as principal is void as an attachment bond. The signature of an individual member of the partnership adds no force or value to the obligation, and provides no additional security in behalf of the defendant, and hence the signing of such a bond by one of the members of the firm individually is ineffectual to provide security upon the attachment bond as required by law, and amounts to no more than if no one had attempted to sign the attachment bond as security. . . . The provisions of section 5062 of the Civil Code apply in cases where an attachment bond is insufficient as to amount or where the solvency of the security is questionable, but this section of the Code does not authorize the amendment of a bond which is absolutely void, or permit the filing of an attachment bond for the first time at the trial term. The lower court did not err in refusing to allow the amendment of the attachment bond, nor in dismissing the attachment on the ground that no bond had been given as required by law."</div><div class="casepar">In this connection see also Bryan Bank v. Carter, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 519</span> (196 S. E. 228) wherein this court said: "Therefore, where a named bank sued out an attachment against another, and gave the required bond, signed by one as president of such bank, and thereafter the defendant in attachment moved to dismiss the same on the ground that the bond as executed was not a valid and binding obligation of the bank but only of the person signing the same, and this motion was sustained and an amendment making the bond a valid obligation of the bank was rejected, the defendant in attachment can not thereafter maintain a suit against the bank on such bond as its obligation. The bond sued on is void so far as the bank is concerned. It is not an obligation enforceable against the bank. The plaintiff having successfully contended that the bond sued on was void, not merely defective, may not now bring an action on such bond, and assert its validity."</div><div class="casepar">In Gibbs v. Rhodes Furniture Co., <span class="casemissing">58 Ga. App. 352</span> (198 S. E. 315) this court held that a suit against a corporation can not be amended by converting it into a suit against an individual. It follows that a bond signed by an individual can not be changed by amendment to a bond signed by a corporation. See also Stone v. Atlantic Engineering &amp;c. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../693/89/index.html">95 Ga. App. 312</a></span> (97 S. E. 2d 709).</div><div class="casepar">Counsel for the defendant call our attention to Sutherlin v. Underwriters' Agency, <span class="casemissing">53 Ga. 442</span>; Ellison v. Ga. R. &amp; Bkg. Co., <span class="casemissing">87 Ga. 691</span> (13 S. E. 809), and Anthanissen v. Brunswick &amp; South Atlantic Steam &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">92 Ga. 409</span> (17 S. E. 951). These cases are not applicable to the facts in the instant case.</div><div class="casepar">The court erred in the judgment refusing to dismiss the attachment.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Dubignion (Dub) Douglas, Jones &amp; Douglas, E.
