Appellees did not seek an appeal from this ruling. Instead, in February of 1993, appellees filed a revised application for a recall petition against appellants.

The superior court upheld the constitutionality of the Act and, in Case No. S93A1341, appellants appeal from that ruling.</div><div class="casepar">The identical enumerations of error have been filed in both cases.

[Cit.]</div><div class="casepar">City of Ludowici v. Stapleton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../496/6/index.html">258 Ga. 868</a></span>, 869 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../496/6/index.html">375 SE2d 855</a></span>) (1989). " 'But it is also true that an official takes his office subject to the conditions imposed by the terms and nature of the political system in which he operates.' [Cit.]" Eaves v. Harris, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../460/8/index.html">258 Ga. 1</a></span>, 3 (2) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../460/8/index.html">364 SE2d 854</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">Recall is a procedure whereby it is the voters themselves who make the ultimate determination as to whether an official should retain his office for the duration of the term to which he was elected. Compare City of Ludowici v. Stapleton, supra (impeachment of mayor by aldermen); Eaves v. Harris, supra (suspension of county commissioner by governor); Coleman v. Glenn, <span class="casemissing">103 Ga. 458 (30 SE 297) (1898)</span> (removal of members of county board of education by superior court upon recommendation of grand jury). The electorate's right of recall derives from our constitution. Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. II, Sec. II, Par. IV. "The people's right to seek recall of its public officers is a substantial right. . . ." Howell v. Tidwell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../471/2/index.html">258 Ga. 246</a></span>, 247 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../471/2/index.html">368 SE2d 311</a></span>) (1988). Accordingly, appellants took office subject to the condition that they could be recalled by the electorate.</div><div class="casepar">Appellants urge, however, that the recall "condition" provided in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/6/index.html">21-4-6</a></span> (f) is unconstitutional because it denies an elected official an opportunity for a judicial hearing to determine the truth or falsity of the alleged facts upon which the recall application is based. Our constitution authorizes the General Assembly to provide for the "procedures, grounds, and all other matters relative to . . . recall. . . ." It does not, however, authorize the General Assembly, in doing so, to deny an elected official due process. Nevertheless,</div><div class="casepar">the amount of due process required depends upon the circumstances at hand: " ' "(d)ue process," unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.' [Cit.] '(D)ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.' (Cit.)"</div><div class="casepar">Eaves v. Harris, supra at 4 (2) (b).</div><div class="casepar">Through enactment of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/6/index.html">21-4-6</a></span> (f), the General Assembly has provided that an elected official is entitled to judicial review of the recall application to determine whether a statutorily specified ground for recall has been indeed stated and whether the supporting allegations of fact, if true, would authorize a finding that the statutorily specified ground for recall exists.</div><div class="casepar">If one or more of the statutory grounds for recall set forth in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/3/index.html">21-4-3</a></span> (7) (B) are alleged in the recall application, then the ground or grounds for recall are legally sufficient. To determine if the "fact or facts upon which such ground or grounds are based" are legally sufficient, a [superior] court should consider the following: 1) assuming the fact or facts to be true, [whether] they allege misconduct which constitutes a legally sufficient ground for recall according to the statutory definition of that term; 2) if so, [whether] the fact or facts are stated with "reasonable particularity[.]" [Cit.] (Emphasis omitted.) Brooks v. Branch, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/0/index.html">262 Ga. 658</a></span>, 659-660 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/0/index.html">424 SE2d 277</a></span>) (1993). Thus, the statute does provide for judicial review of the legal sufficiency of the recall application.</div><div class="casepar">Once the recall application has been judicially determined to be legally sufficient as to both the stated ground and the alleged factual support, the recall petition can then circulate and, if a sufficient number of qualified voters sign the petition, a recall election will be held in accordance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/13/index.html">21-4-13</a></span>. Since recall is a concept which is predicated upon the power of the electorate to remove its elected officials, a statute which provides that the electorate, rather than the judiciary, shall determine the ultimate truth or falsity of the allegations of misconduct is certainly consistent with that concept.</div><div class="casepar">"The fundamental idea of due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard. [Cit.] Due process [does not guarantee] a particular form or method of state procedure. [Cit.]" Nix v. Long Mtn. Resources, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../339/2/index.html">262 Ga. 506</a></span>, 509 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../339/2/index.html">422 SE2d 195</a></span>) (1992). Since "due process" is a flexible concept which calls for such procedural protection as the " ' "particular situation demands[,]" ' " (Eaves v. Harris, supra at 4 (2) (b)), a statute limiting the role of the judiciary in the "particular situation" of the recall of public officers to that of making merely an initial determination as to the legal sufficiency of the recall application and, if it is sufficient, allowing the electorate ultimately to decide if the officer will or will not be recalled is not unconstitutional. "We conclude, in sum, that the [recall] statute affords adequate due process protection to the public official. . . ." Eaves v. Harris, supra at 4-5 (2) (b).</div><div class="casepar">2. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/14/index.html">21-4-14</a></span> (a) provides limitations as to the filing of additional petitions for recall after a recall election has been held. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/14/index.html">21-4-14</a></span> (b) prohibits the filing of another application within six months after a recall petition has been found to be insufficient. However, there is no statutory provision proscribing the filing of an additional application subsequent to a judicial determination that a prior application was legally insufficient. The superior court found that its determination of the legal insufficiency of the original application for a recall petition filed by appellees in October of 1992 would not be a bar to the revised application filed by appellees in February of 1993. Appellants enumerate this ruling as error, urging that res judicata is a viable defense to appellees' revised application.</div><div class="casepar">"Under both [the doctrine of res judicata and that of estoppel by judgment], in order for the former decision to be conclusive, it must have been based, not merely on technical grounds, but at least in part on the merits where under the pleadings they were or could have been involved. [Cits.]" [Cits.] Powell v. Powell, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 379</span>, 383 (2) (<span class="casemissing">37 SE2d 191</span>) (1946). As discussed in Division 1, the statutory recall scheme enacted by the legislature does not permit the superior court to address the merits of the alleged grounds upon which the application for a recall petition is to be sought.</div><div class="casepar">This statutory scheme is not such as would afford office holders a viable res judicata defense against submission of a revised application for a recall petition. Since judicial review is statutorily limited to a determination of the legal sufficiency of the form of the application for a recall petition, any previous judicial determination as to the legal insufficiency of the form of an application for a recall petition would not give rise to the assertion of a viable res judicata defense against submission of a subsequent revised application for a recall petition. See generally Smith v. Davis, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../155/15/index.html">222 Ga. 839 (152 SE2d 870) (1967)</a></span>. A former adjudication merely as to form rather than on the merits does not operate as res judicata. Goldstein v. Ga. R. &amp;c. Co., <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. App. 688 (2) (121 SE 846) (1924)</span>. Res judicata does not attach to a judicial ruling which "points out a defect in form rather than a defect in substance. [Cit.]" Westbrook v. Griffin, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 290 (1) (108 SE 123) (1921)</span>. Under the statutory recall scheme enacted by the legislature, it is only the provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/14/index.html">21-4-14</a></span>, not the doctrine of res judicata, which operate as a constraint upon the initiation of a subsequent recall effort. It follows that the superior court correctly held that its mere determination of the legal insufficiency of the form of the application for a recall petition filed by appellees in October of 1992 would not be a bar to the revised application filed by appellees in February of 1993.</div><div class="casepar">BENHAM, Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</div><div class="casepar">I respectfully dissent from Division 1 of the majority opinion because I believe the Recall Act unconstitutionally deprives an elected official of the official's property right in the office without due process of law.</div><div class="casepar">I concur fully in the majority's statements that an elected official has a property interest in the office that can be taken away only by procedures meeting the requirements of due process, that an elected official takes office subject to the possibility of being recalled by the electorate in the future, and that an elected official is statutorily entitled to judicial scrutiny only of the legal sufficiency of the recall application. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/6/index.html">21-4-6</a></span> (f). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> I also agree with the majority's implicit assertion that due process does not entitle an elected official to a judicial hearing on the veracity of the allegations set forth in the recall application. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> However, contrary to the majority's conclusion, the sum of these principles does not equal the adequate due process protection to which the public official is entitled.</div><div class="casepar">The requirements of due process are satisfied if a citizen has reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard to present a claim or defense. Hancock v. Bd. of Tax Assessors, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../141/19/index.html">226 Ga. 570 (176 SE2d 102) (1970)</a></span>; Murphy v.

Hardison, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../835/6/index.html">245 Ga. 599 (2) (266 SE2d 205) (1980)</a></span>. The Georgia Recall Act provides an elected official with adequate notice of the transpiring events by requiring the election superintendent to notify the targeted elected official that an application for recall has been officially issued for circulation (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/5/index.html">21-4-5</a></span> (b) (2)); that a completed application for a recall petition has been filed with the election superintendent (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/5/index.html">21-4-5</a></span> (b) (3)); that a recall petition has been officially issued for circulation (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/5/index.html">21-4-5</a></span> (i)); and that the legal sufficiency or insufficiency of the recall petition has been certified (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/11/index.html">21-4-11</a></span> (e)). The official has notice of the allegations asserted against him since both the application for recall petition filed with the election superintendent and the recall petition circulated among the electorate contain "a brief statement of the fact or facts upon which the ground or grounds [of recall] are based," written by the recall proponents. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/5/index.html">21-4-5</a></span> (b) (D); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/7/index.html">21-4-7</a></span> (c).</div><div class="casepar">The grounds for recall are statutorily required to be repeatedly put before the electorate: the "brief statement" of the facts upon which the recall is based must be read by or to each signer of the recall petition. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/7/index.html">21-4-7</a></span> (c). Should the proceedings reach the point that a recall election is conducted, the ground or grounds for recall must be printed on the ballot. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/21/4/13/index.html">21-4-13</a></span> (e). Yet nowhere does the statute give the elected official an opportunity to be heard on the matter.

But each State does extend to the beleaguered elected official an opportunity to be heard -- the opportunity to present his side of the story to the electorate and justify the conduct which is serving as the basis for taking his office from him. Georgia's statute does not provide the means by which an official may be heard on the issue.</div><div class="casepar">I recognize that we have adopted the U. S. Supreme Court's statement that "due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 334-335 (96 SC 893, 47 LE2d 18) (1976), cited in Eaves v. Harris, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../460/8/index.html">258 Ga. 1 (2)</a></span> (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../460/8/index.html">364 SE2d 854</a></span>) (1988). In Eaves, we endorsed a flexible standard of due process after emphasizing that a suspension from office pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/45/5/6/index.html">45-5-6</a></span> entailed only a temporary loss of official authority with no loss of pay, and had as its "triggering device" an indictment based upon a finding of probable cause that the elected official committed a crime. Due process cannot bend so far where the Recall Act is concerned, as recall has at stake the very permanent taking of an office with the concomitant permanent loss of pay, and is not the product of any official finding of probable cause.</div><div class="casepar">It is the responsibility of the judiciary, under our system of "checks and balances," to ensure that the procedure of recall enacted by the General Assembly affords the elected official due process of law. See City of Ludowici v. Stapleton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../496/6/index.html">258 Ga. 868 (375 SE2d 855) (1989)</a></span>. After examining our statutory scheme, I find it sadly lacking a fundamental ingredient -- due process of law. On that basis, I conclude that the statute is unconstitutional and that the judgment of the trial court finding it constitutional (Case No. S93A1341) should be reversed.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Justice Hunstein joins in this opinion.</div><div class="casepar">Brinson, Askew, Berry, Seigler, Richardson &amp; Davis, C.

      Several states employ procedures other than recall or removal election to take an office from the elected official.
