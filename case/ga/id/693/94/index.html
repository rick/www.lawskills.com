Williams, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 130</span>, 135 S. E. 755 and citations); and the failure of the defendant home building and loan association to secure the policy of insurance constitutes a breach of contract, the measure of damage for which is the loss to the plaintiff's intestate occasioned by such breach, and the defendant home building and loan association is estopped to insist upon payment of the loan or to sell the secured property upon failure of payment; and the trial court, in such a case, commits reversible error in sustaining a general demurrer to a petition brought by the plaintiff (wife of the intestate) against the home building and loan association for such breach. See generally in this connection Southern Life Ins. Co. v. Citizens Bank of Nashville, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../704/01/index.html">91 Ga. App. 534</a></span> (86 S. E. 2d 370).</div><div class="casepar">When the loan transfer was completed, Reeves, acting in his official capacity as an executive officer of the defendant, informed Hester that he had term life insurance on his life, and that the loan was protected, and Hester, having trust and confidence in what the officer of the defendant told him, relied upon the representation that the loan was properly covered with term life insurance. Reeves, acting in his official capacity as treasurer and assistant secretary of the defendant, contracted with Hester to procure a term life insurance policy on Hester's life payable to the defendant to pay the balance due on the real-estate loan in the event of Hester's death. The defendant procures for its borrowers term life insurance on the lives of its borrowers with the Liberty Life Insurance Company, of Greenville, South Carolina. Such insurance pays off the unpaid balance due on the defendant's loans in the event of their deaths. It was, and is, the custom of the defendant to procure such insurance, to collect the premiums there on, to remit them to Liberty Life Insurance Company, of Greenville, South Carolina, and in the event of the death of the borrower while the loan is outstanding, to collect the insurance and to apply it to the cancellation of the loan. It inures to the benefit of both the defendant and its borrowers to have such insurance, and for that reason, it is procured by the defendant for its borrowers. No policy of term life insurance was delivered to the insured, T. M. Hester. Mr. Hester died intestate March 26, 1954. The plaintiff was appointed administratrix of Hester's estate on December 6, 1954, and is the duly qualified and acting administratrix of his estate and brings this suit in that capacity. The first payment of $36.95 was paid on the loan on September 4, 1951, by T. M. Hester, $35 of which was for the principal and interest on the loan, and $1.95 of which was as premium on the term life insurance on Hester's life. These payments continued each month until Hester's death. The last payment was made March 2, 1954, just prior to his death. The premiums on said term life insurance were included in and collected with the payments on the real-estate loan, and these payments were not in default. The defendant fraudulently did not take out or procure the term life insurance on the life of T. M. Hester, as contracted with Hester, after collecting premiums thereon from the date of the loan until just prior to Hester's death. The defendant breached its contract to procure this term life insurance and damaged the estate of Hester in the sum of $1,379.66. After Hester's death, the defendant admitted that it had collected insurance premiums from Hester and tendered these premiums to the plaintiff which she refused and which she still refuses to accept. These admissions and tender were made by Fred J. Reeves in his official capacity as an executive officer of the defendant. On Hester's death, the term life insurance, if it had been procured under the contract between Hester and the defendant, would have liquidated the loan on the realty so as to free it of indebtedness, but the defendant corporation refused to cancel the loan. On January 4, 1955, the defendant sold the property at public auction for the sum of $1,379.66, as shown by a copy of a deed which is attached to and made part of the petition. The defendant has breached its contract with Hester and has thus damaged his estate in the sum of $1,379.66, which sum would have enured to the benefit of his estate by paying off the balance due on the real estate, thus canceling the loan. On the date of the sale of the property by the defendant, neither T. M. Hester nor his estate was indebted to the defendant in any sum whatsoever, by reason of the defendant's having breached its contract with Hester to procure the term life insurance on his life.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed general and special demurrers upon various grounds. The trial court sustained the general demurrers and dismissed the petition. The plaintiff assigns error here solely upon that judgment.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Thomasson &amp; Thomasson, for plaintiff in error.</div></div><div class="casechrono">DECIDED JANUARY 10, 1957 -- REHEARING DENIED MARCH 18, 1957.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="caseinlinks"><div class="header">
