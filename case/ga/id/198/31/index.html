DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Hancock.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Atlanta Casualty Company brought a declaratory judgment action against its insured, Dimple B. Thomas, for not giving it notice of service of a renewal action in tort against her brought by Laura A. Maestas, which tort action resulted in a default judgment in excess of the minimum policy limits. Atlanta Casualty contended that it gave a reservation of rights notice to Thomas; however, there is no copy of any such notice in the record. Atlanta Casualty's declaratory judgment action stated "that it is uncertain as to whether that policy affords coverage for the judgment entered against Thomas in the Renewal Action." Thomas counterclaimed against Atlanta Casualty for bad faith in failing to settle the case for policy limits, which exposed her to a judgment in excess of the policy limits. Atlanta Casualty moved for summary judgment as to its declaratory judgment action and on Thomas' counterclaim which the trial court granted. On September 27, 2000, Thomas filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action based upon Morgan v. Guaranty Nat. Cos., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../151/2/index.html">268 Ga. 343 (489 SE2d 803) (1997)</a></span>. After several continuances, the trial court set the motions for hearing at 9:30 a.m. on January 3, 2001. At 8:30 a.m., prior to the hearing at 9:30 a.m. on January 3, 2001, Atlanta Casualty dismissed its declaratory action with prejudice and served notice to Thomas by depositing a copy in the mail on January 3, 2001. The trial court went ahead and heard Atlanta Casualty's motion for summary judgment on all issues, ignoring in its order the voluntary dismissal, if it had notice. On January 22, 2001, the order granting the motion was filed after being prepared by the plaintiff, which indicated that the trial court had ruled in open court for the plaintiff and had directed the order's preparation by the prevailing party in open court on January 3, 2001, at the conclusion of the hearing and prior to the defendant's receipt of the dismissal in the mail as indicated by the certificate of service.</div><div class="casepar">For the voluntary dismissal to be effective, the opposite party must be served with it or have actual notice of the dismissal; until such notice, the dismissal is dormant. Jones v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../129/78/index.html">230 Ga. 738</a></span>, 739-740 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../129/78/index.html">199 SE2d 239</a></span>) (1973). When plaintiff's counsel announces to the trial court the intent to voluntarily dismiss, signed a voluntary dismissal that day, and served upon the defense by mail, the voluntary dismissal does not occur until it is filed with the clerk and received by defense counsel. Id.; Carter v. Digby, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../217/53/index.html">244 Ga. App. 217 (535 SE2d 273) (2000)</a></span>. The oral announcement of a ruling on summary judgment in open court constitutes a verdict, which prevents a voluntary dismissal taking effect.

In this case, if the dismissal had been effective, then the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant summary judgment on the declaratory judgment. Lakes v.

Either Thomas had been served in the underlying tort action and failed to notify Atlanta Casualty, although there is some evidence that the third party gave such notice prior to taking a default judgment, or there was a factual issue. Atlanta Casualty either had prior notice of the renewed suit prior to judgment given by the third party and either negligently failed to defend or to settle within policy limits after the insured's demand or with conscious indifference it failed to timely defend by seeking to open a default, which may constitute bad faith, or it did not act in bad faith. Such issues of fact, which had already occurred, created no uncertainty as to what action Atlanta Casualty should take, because all rights had accrued among the parties so that it needed no guidance as to uncertainty from the trial court. Therefore, it could not use a declaratory judgment action to litigate its coverage defenses after the facts had taken place fixing everyone's rights. Further, there is no evidence in the record that Atlanta Casualty proceeded under any reservation of rights with Thomas.</div><div class="casepar">A declaratory judgment action will not lie where the rights between the parties have already accrued, because there is no uncertainty as to the rights of the parties and risk as to taking future action. See Empire Fire &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Metro Courier Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../244/70/index.html">234 Ga.

An insurer cannot create a controversy for declaratory judgment action by filing a suit to determine rights that have already accrued from the prior action of the parties. Miller v. Southern Heritage Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/72/index.html">215 Ga. App. 173</a></span>, 174-175 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../294/72/index.html">450 SE2d 432</a></span>) (1994), overruled in part on other grounds, Hurst v. Grange Mut. Cas.

When a purported declaratory judgment action does not meet the criteria for a declaratory judgment, the trial court must dismiss the action without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or the appellate court will dismiss the action. Id. at 581; Morgan v. Guaranty Nat. Cos., supra at 344; Empire Fire &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Metro Courier Corp., supra at 673-674 (2).</div><div class="casepar">2. In determining Thomas' compulsory counterclaim, this Court must also determine the issues raised in the declaratory judgment action because such issues are defenses to an action for bad faith. Therefore, Atlanta Casualty has maneuvered the trial court and this Court into deciding issues that should not have arisen absent suit by Thomas against Atlanta Casualty for bad faith, but are raised in this suit as a compulsory counterclaim, which counterclaim arose from the conduct of the insurer regarding an untimely defense after notice from a third party of the renewal suit. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/13/index.html">9-11-13</a></span> (a); contra Colonial Penn Ins. Co. v. Hart, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../480/61/index.html">162 Ga. App. 333</a></span>, 338 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../480/61/index.html">291 SE2d 410</a></span>) (1982) (tort case against insured did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence to constitute a compulsory counterclaim to the insurer's declaratory judgment action to determine coverage). To avoid such procedural gamesmanship of who gets to the courthouse first, the trial court should have dismissed the declaratory judgment action on its own motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">3. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment on disputed issues of material fact raised by Thomas' evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(a) On March 14, 1996, counsel for Maestas sent a certified letter to Atlanta Casualty with a copy of the renewed complaint, giving notice of the renewed action against Thomas; such notice was provided 392 days prior to any default judgment being taken. Thus, Atlanta Casualty's untimely defense of Thomas becomes an issue of either negligence, intentional misconduct, or no liability. Thomas in her answer to the declaratory judgment action pled that Atlanta Casualty had received notice of the renewal suit from Maestas, because Thomas had no knowledge of service made upon her. Further to the contrary, on January 7, 1999, John Marshall's affidavit alleges that Atlanta Casualty received the first notice of the renewal action from Maestas' counsel, although on March 14, 1996, Maestas' counsel had earlier provided notice and a copy of the suit, which creates a material issue of fact for jury determination. Such material issues of fact as to notice are for the determination not by the trial court but by the jury.

Counsel for the injured party can give the requisite notice of an accident under the policy to avoid a notice defense under the policy, because "it makes no difference who gives notice, so long as a reasonable and timely notice is given the company and it has actual knowledge of the pendency of a claim or suit." (Citation and punctuation omitted.) State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Sloan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../527/79/index.html">150 Ga. App. 464</a></span>, 467 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../527/79/index.html">258 SE2d 146</a></span>) (1979); Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Farone, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../599/90/index.html">129 Ga. App. 471</a></span>, 474 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../599/90/index.html">199 SE2d 852</a></span>) (1973). Thus, notice of the pending suit can also be given by a third party to comply with the policy condition.</div><div class="casepar">(d) On February 18, 1999, Thomas' personal counsel made a demand upon Atlanta Casualty to settle the case within policy limits, because Atlanta Casualty had allowed the case to go to default judgment without defending even though it was on notice of the renewed suit since March 14, 1996. Instead of settling within the policy limits, Atlanta Casualty unsuccessfully sought to set aside the default judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Although policy limits were the minimum coverage at $15,000, Atlanta Casualty in failing to timely defend and to pay policy limits after the default judgment was entered may be liable for bad faith and the full amount of the judgment where such consequential damages can be traced directly to the failure to timely defend. The issue of consequential damages, i.e., judgment in excess of the policy limits, and causation were matters for jury determination. Leader Nat. Ins. Co. v. Kemp &amp; Son, Inc., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../437/6/index.html">259 Ga. 329</a></span>, 330 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../437/6/index.html">380 SE2d 458</a></span>) (1989); Atlanta Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gardenhire, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../207/50/index.html">248 Ga. App. 42</a></span>, 44 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../207/50/index.html">545 SE2d 182</a></span>) (2001). "[W]here an insurance company fails to offer a defense, it may be liable to its insured beyond the policy limits to the full amount of the judgment. . . . Nevertheless, we agree with Atlanta Casualty that a jury question exists as to the extent of its liability." (Citations omitted.) Atlanta Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gardenhire, supra at 44-45 (2). TP=In this case, Atlanta Casualty did not attempt to open the default prior to a default judgment being taken; it sought to set aside the default judgment after it was entered. Where the insured is in default, has a meritorious defense, and has a legal excuse for the default, and the insurer has notice of both the pending action and the default of the insured prior to plaintiff taking a default judgment, a jury question arises as to whether the insurer's failure to seek to open default constitutes bad faith, giving rise to liability. See generally Ga. Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Martin, supra, 264 Ga. at 350-351.</div><div class="casepar">(e) The failure either to settle within policy limits or to make an offer of settlement creates an issue of bad faith of the insurer, because the issue arises whether the insurer places its financial interest superior to the interests of its insured who is placed at great risk for an excess judgment. "We think it clear that an even greater duty rests upon the [insurer] after a verdict in excess of the policy limitation has been returned and an offer of settlement within the policy is made." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Evans, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/79/index.html">116 Ga. App. 93</a></span>, 95-96 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/79/index.html">156 SE2d 809</a></span>) (1967), aff'd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../152/00/index.html">223 Ga. 789 (158 SE2d 243) (1967)</a></span>. Where there was a default judgment already in excess of the policy limits, the insurer has the duty to act with the utmost good faith on behalf of the insured to dispose of the judgment against her without exposing her to the risk of excess liability inherent in the default judgment. "As a professional in the defense of suits, [the insurer] must use a degree of skill commensurate with such professional standards. As the champion of the insured, [the insurer] must consider as paramount [her] interests, rather than its own, and may not gamble with [her] funds." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Evans, supra, 116 Ga. App. at 95 (2). Where a default judgment is unlikely to be set aside on general grounds, for the insurer to refuse to settle but to seek to set the judgment aside and to appeal the denial raises an issue of bad faith. U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Evans, supra, 223 Ga. at 789. When the insurer considers its own self-interest regarding whether or not to settle a case within policy limits, the insurer must give at least equal consideration to the interests of its insured under the facts and circumstances of the case. U. S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Evans, supra, 116 Ga. App. at 95; see also Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../329/5/index.html">262 Ga. 267</a></span>, 268-269 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../329/5/index.html">416 SE2d 274</a></span>) (1992).</div><div class="casepar">It is no longer open to question in this State that the claim of an insured under an automobile liability policy for damages on account of the bad faith tortious refusal of the insurer to settle a liability claim against [her] within the policy limits resulting in damage to [her] in the form of a judgment in excess of the policy limits being returned against [her] is a legitimate charge against the insurer upon which recovery may be had by the insured.</div><div class="casepar">(Citations omitted.) Shaw v. Caldwell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/63/index.html">229 Ga. 87</a></span>, 91 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/63/index.html">189 SE2d 684</a></span>) (1972); see also Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../344/55/index.html">200 Ga.

"In deciding whether to accept an offer to settle a claim within policy limits, the insurer must accord the interest of its insured the same faithful consideration it gives its own interest. It is for the jury to decide whether the insurer has or has not so acted." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, supra, 200 Ga. App. at 761 (2).</div><div class="casepar">Thus, finding Thomas with a default judgment against her, Atlanta Casualty should have considered settlement to protect the insured instead of seeking a policy defense to void coverage which would expose the insured to liability on an excess default judgment.</div><div class="casepar">(f) Where an insurer violates its fiduciary duty to its insured and puts its interests superior to its insured, such conduct may be found to be tortious, either negligent or bad faith. Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, supra, 262 Ga. at 268-269 (1); McCall v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/6/index.html">251 Ga. 869</a></span>, 870 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/6/index.html">310 SE2d 513</a></span>) (1984). Ignoring the notice of the renewal action prior to the default judgment being taken may constitute at a minimum negligence or at worst bad faith. "The jury generally must decide whether the insurer, in view of the existing circumstances, has accorded the insured `the same faithful consideration it gives its own interest.' [Cits.]" Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, supra, 262 Ga. at 268-269 (1).</div><div class="casepar">Where there has been such entire want of care amounting to a conscious indifference to the consequences, this may constitute tortious conduct making punitive damages authorized in any action for negligence or intentional tort of bad faith; this creates a jury question as to whether clear and convincing evidence exists as to such conduct by Atlanta Casualty. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>; Brown v. StarMed Staffing, 227 Ga. App.749, 755 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../262/40/index.html">490 SE2d 503</a></span>) (1997); see also Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, supra, 200 Ga. App. at 768-770 (6), rev'd in part on other grounds. However, for the award of punitive damages to Thomas, she must recover some compensatory damages caused by either the negligence or bad faith of Atlanta Casualty. Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, supra, 262 Ga. at 270 (2). However, in this case, the alleged tortious conduct ofAtlanta Casualty may be found to have resulted in a judgment against Thomas in excess of her policy limits, which constitutes pecuniary damages necessary to support punitive damages.
