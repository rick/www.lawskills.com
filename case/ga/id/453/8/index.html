OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/38/index.html">5-6-38</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, Gower brought suit against McClure for specific performance of a real-estate sales contract. Gower also named WGBA, Inc., as a party defendant, based on allegations of tortious interference by WGBA with Gower's rights under his contract with McClure. After the trial court rendered a decree of specific performance, the jury returned a verdict against McClure, awarding Gower actual damages, as well as attorney fees incurred as part of his expenses of litigation. Verdicts were also returned against WGBA, in which Gower was awarded both actual and punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">The facts of this case are not overly complex:</div><div class="casepar">Gower is an attorney, and the subject property is adjacent to his law office; he wants to use the property as a parking lot.</div><div class="casepar">McClure entered into a contract to sell the property to Gower for $85,000 after McClure's real-estate agent told Gower that McClure wanted to "net" $80,000 for the property, and the agent wanted a $5,000 commission.</div><div class="casepar">evidence warrants it. There is nothing to refute your evidence. It is in the complaint and it is in the record. Mr. Fierer says he has nothing to -- in opposition. . . ." [Emphasis supplied.] A closing date was agreed to by McClure's real estate agent and Gower's attorney approximately one week in advance, and this was communicated to both Gower and McClure. On the morning of the scheduled closing, McClure informed the closing attorney that he, McClure, would be unable to attend the closing because he was going out of town, although McClure further stated that he would return in a day or two and that a contract extension would be unnecessary. Gower arrived at the closing at the scheduled time, presented a check for the amount due, and signed the requisite documents. When McClure returned to town, his real estate agent tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to communicate with him. After approximately one week, the agent finally spoke to McClure, and he stated that he did not intend to close the contract, because a strategically located advertising sign of WGBA radio was located on the property; his son was affiliated with the radio station; and Gower would not agree to let the sign remain on the property.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict against McClure for $586.36 in actual damages, consisting of lost interest on the earnest money deposit, and $8,219.10 in litigation expenses/attorney fees; in regard to the amount of the attorney fee award, Gower's attorney gave testimony concerning his training and credentials, his hours spent on this case, and his customary hourly fee.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict against WGBA for $33 in actual damages, also consisting of lost interest on the earnest money deposit, and $1,500 in punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">In Case No. S89A0149, McClure filed an appeal in this Court as to the trial court's decree of specific performance and the jury's attorney fee award to Gower.</div><div class="casepar">In Case No. S89A0615, Gower filed an independent appeal in the Court of Appeals, complaining about the trial court's refusal to allow closing argument of counsel in the latter phase of this bifurcated tort trial. A motion to dismiss Gower's appeal was filed by WGBA on the ground that Gower failed to file requisite discretionary appeal procedures under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/35/index.html">5-6-35</a></span> (a) (6), in that Gower's appeal, standing alone, is an appeal of a money judgment in an amount less than $2,500. Finding that Gower's appeal in the Court of Appeals "may function as a cross appeal" to McClure's appeal in this Court, the Court of Appeals transferred Gower's appeal to us.</div><div class="casepar">For reasons which follow, we affirm the judgment in Case No. S89A0149, which is McClure's appeal of the judgment entered against him. We reverse the judgment in Case No. S89A0615, which is Gower's appeal of the judgment entered against WGBA. And, inasmuch as Case No. S89X0344 is also an appeal by Gower of the judgment entered against WGBA, we dismiss this appeal as duplicative.</div><div class="casepar">1. Contrary to McClure's assertions, there was ample evidence as to the sufficiency of the purchase price. See generally McLoon v.

Since final judgment was entered against McClure and WGBA on the same date, Gower's original notice of appeal, which was filed within 30 days of the entry of the judgment, was filed within the 15-day time limit as well.</div><div class="casepar">In regard to whether his original notice of appeal could be amended so as to designate this Court rather than the Court of Appeals as the appellate court to which the appeal was to be taken, Gower, citing Griffin v.

See Munday v. Brissette, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../648/13/index.html">113 Ga.

And, the trial judge gave instructions to the jury in regard to the reasons for awarding punitive damages and the circumstances under which such damages are awardable.</div><div class="casepar">However, at the phase of the trial in which the amount of the punitive damage award was adjudicated, the trial court did not allow counsel to present closing argument to the jury. In this regard, the court ruled that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) (2) provides for the receipt of evidence, but not the argument of counsel, in regard to the amount of punitive damages at the latter stage of a bifurcated tort trial.</div><div class="casepar">We hold that in so ruling, the trial court committed reversible error.</div><div class="casepar">The courts in this country have taken divergent views in regard to whether or not it is per se reversible error, where counsel in a civil case has been denied the right to argue material issues of fact to the jury; and there is no bright line of demarcation dividing those cases in which it has been held that there was an infringement of this right by the trial court, from other cases in which it has been held that there was only a permissible regulation of the right in the exercise of the trial court's discretion. See Givans v. Chicago &amp;c. R. Co., 238 Minn. 176 (56 NW2d 306, 38 ALR2d 1393) (1952).</div><div class="casepar">In this state, we have held that the right of the parties to be represented by counsel at all stages of a trial is a fundamental component of our system of jurisprudence. Reynolds v. Reynolds, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../166/04/index.html">217 Ga. 234 (25) (123 SE2d 115) (1961)</a></span>. And, in regard to the presentation of arguments concerning the full range of evidentiary issues in the case, it has been held:</div><div class="casepar">The attorneys in the cause are not mere carriers to bring in materials for constructing the edifice; they have a right, as representing the parties, to suggest where every important stone should be laid, and to assign reasons, drawn from legitimate sources, in support of their suggestions. Their reasons may be good or bad, but such as they are they should be heard and considered. [ VanDyke v. Martin, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. 466</span>, 470 (1875).]</div><div class="casepar">The duties of the advocate are among the most elevated functions of humanity. Whilst he is the representative of his client's cause . . . [h]is business is to comment on the evidence -- to sift, compare and collate the facts -- to draw his illustrations from the whole circle of the sciences -- to reason with the accuracy and power of the trained logician, and enforce his cause with all the inspirations of genius, and adorn it with all the attributes of eloquence. It is the business of the Jury to listen, to be informed, but not to obey. They sit, the sworn arbiters of the cause, bound by the most solemn sanctions, to do justice between the parties, according to the evidence. [Emphasis in original.] [Garrison v.
