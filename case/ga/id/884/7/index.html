Taliaferro Superior Court. Before Judge Stevens.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Judson Ruffin was indicted in Taliaferro County with two others on a multi-count indictment. He was tried separately and convicted and sentenced as follows: for armed robbery and kidnapping (two counts) life imprisonment was imposed; for murder the death penalty was imposed; for aggravated assault ten years imprisonment was imposed (consecutive) and for possession of a firearm five years imprisonment was imposed (consecutive).</div><div class="casepar">His case is before this court on direct appeal and for review of the death penalty imposed.</div><div class="casepar">I. Summary of the Evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence produced at trial, including Ruffin's confession, justified the jury in finding the following facts:</div><div class="casepar">In the late evening hours of July 26, 1976, Henry Lee Phillips was operating an Amoco service station off 1-20 near Crawfordsville, Georgia, with his eleven-year-old stepson, Bonnie Bulloch, helping him. A car pulled into the station with three occupants. The appellant and the two co-indictees, Nathan Brown and Jose High, were in the car. The car had been in the station a week or two earlier. The three men got out of the car and one pointed a pistol at Phillips. Appellant had a sawed-off shotgun. Phillips was forced to leave the booth while the appellant removed the money from the register and demanded any other money. When Phillips told him that there was no more money, the appellant grabbed Bonnie Bulloch and told Phillips to get in the car trunk or Phillips and the boy would be killed.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant and his two companions returned to Augusta and he was subsequently apprehended, apparently on a different charge.</div><div class="casepar">II. Enumerations of Error.</div><div class="casepar">1. Appellant alleges as his first enumeration that "[t]he Court erred in overruling the defendant's motion for a new trial on general grounds."</div><div class="casepar">We have examined the transcript of trial and conclude that the verdict is not contrary to law or the evidence and there was ample evidence to support the verdict of the jury. Enumeration 1 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. In his second enumeration, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in allowing G.B.I. Agent Chuck Monahan and Agent Bob Ingram to remain in the courtroom throughout the trial of the case, over objection of the defendant, Judson Ruffin."</div><div class="casepar">The district attorney requested that the two agents remain in the courtroom to assist him in the prosecution of the case. Ga. Code Ann.  38-1703 provides for sequestration of witnesses upon motion of a party. Its enforcement long has been vested in the discretion of the trial court. Jarrell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/54/index.html">234 Ga. 410</a></span>, 420 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/54/index.html">216 SE2d 258</a></span>) (1975); McNeal v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../135/77/index.html">228 Ga. 633 (4) (187 SE2d 271) (1972)</a></span>; Thomas v. State, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. 287 (8)</span> (1859).</div><div class="casepar">We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court. Enumeration 2 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. In his third enumeration, the appellant alleges: "The Court erred in excluding the black jurors from the panel of 42, because the following named jurors stated that they were opposed to capital punishment: Janie Lou Evans; Mildred Moor; Brenda Stevens; Martha C. Turner; Arthur Lee Seals; Dorothy King; Eleanor Ruff; Calvin Turner; Mary Grace Thornton; Ruby Jackson; Mary Sanders; Elizabeth Bird; Calvin Thomas; Mabel Stewart Billingsley; Edna Swain; Martha Edwards; James Howell, and Willie Albert Jones."</div><div class="casepar">Although the appellant alleges that eighteen prospective jurors were excused improperly under the standard established in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968), we do not reach the same conclusion after reading the transcript of the voir dire examination of the panel members. All of the jurors excused because of conscientious objection to the death penalty made it unmistakably clear that they were unalterably opposed to imposition of the death penalty. They expressly stated so in the case of every excused venireman except Martha C. Turner and the context in which she responded it was clear that she was unalterably opposed to the death penalty. See Corn v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../966/2/index.html">240 Ga. 130</a></span>, 132 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../966/2/index.html">240 SE2d 694</a></span>) (1977); Potts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../942/9/index.html">241 Ga. 67</a></span>, 69 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../942/9/index.html">243 SE2d 510</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">The state used only seven of its peremptory challenges. Under Georgia law it had three remaining. Code Ann.  59-907. This court explored the issue of unexercised peremptory strikes and its impact on Witherspoon in Alderman v. State, <span class="casemissing">241 Ga. 496</span>, 499 (<span class="casemissing">246 SE2d 642</span>), cert. den., 99 SC 593 (1978), and concluded (p. 502), "[w]hen the twelfth juror in this case was selected, the State had three peremptory challenges remaining and, therefore, the exclusion of the three complained of jurors for cause, if error at all, was harmless. See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (87 SC 824, 17 LE2d 705) (1967). The presence of unused peremptory strikes by the State forecloses appellant's reliance on Witherspoon."</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, the excuse of juror Martha C. Turner, if error at all, was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">Enumeration 3 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">4. The appellant alleges in Enumeration 4 that "[t]he Court erred in failing to disqualify Traverse Juror, Pat Darden, who was the Coroner of Taliaferro County (and husband of the Clerk of Superior Court of Taliaferro County), and subpoenaed as a witness for the State, and the Court should have required that he be stricken from the panel of 42." In his fifth enumeration he alleges "[t]he court erred in failing to disqualify Grace Beazley, who was the wife of Bailiff Guy Beazley, and an employee of Taliaferro County Health Department."</div><div class="casepar">In Georgia, control of the voir dire examination is vested in the discretion of the trial judge and will not be interfered with unless it is clearly shown that such discretion was abused. Pierce v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../126/62/index.html">231 Ga. 731 (204 SE2d 159) (1974)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The statutory questions to be asked on voir dire on trial for felony are set forth in Code Ann.  59-806. " 'To disqualify one from being a juror in a criminal case, he must have formed and expressed an opinion, either from having seen the crime committed, or from having heard the testimony under oath. One who from some other sources has formed and expressed an opinion which is not fixed and determined, and who indicated his competency by answering the statutory questions on voir dire, is not an incompetent juror.' " Wilburn v. State, <span class="casemissing">141 Ga. 510</span>, 511 (<span class="casemissing">81 SE 444</span>) (1963); Clemon v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../165/14/index.html">218 Ga. 755</a></span>, 757 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../165/14/index.html">130 SE2d 745</a></span>) (1963).</div><div class="casepar">Neither Mr. Darden nor Mrs. Beazley had witnessed the crime or heard testimony about the crime delivered on oath, and there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to exclude them for cause. Butler v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../124/66/index.html">231 Ga. 276 (201 SE2d 448) (1973)</a></span>; Williams v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../153/12/index.html">222 Ga. 208 (149 SE2d 449) (1966)</a></span>; Roach v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/66/index.html">221 Ga. 783</a></span>, 784 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../157/66/index.html">147 SE2d 299</a></span>) (1966).</div><div class="casepar">Inasmuch as the appellant used only 17 of his 20 peremptory challenges we find no merit to his argument that he was required to use peremptory strikes to remove these prospective jurors.</div><div class="casepar">Enumerations 4 and 5 are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">5. In Enumeration 6, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in allowing admission of a sawed-off shotgun taken from the automobile of Jose High in Augusta, Georgia, on August 28, 1976, 32 days after the alleged murder in Taliaferro County, on the statement of the District Attorney, '[t]here will be some evidence in the record.' "</div><div class="casepar">The victim testified that a shotgun was used during the commission of the offense and that the shotgun shown to him at the trial looked like the shotgun which had been pointed at him during the commission of the crime. Other evidence established that a shotgun had been discharged at the scene of the murder and aggravated assault.</div><div class="casepar">"Where, as here, the victim of a crime identifies a weapon as similar to that used in the commission of the crime, the weapon is admissible whether or not it is the identical weapon. Evans v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/44/index.html">228 Ga. 867</a></span>, 870 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/44/index.html">188 SE2d 861</a></span>) (1972). See also Jung v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../105/76/index.html">237 Ga. 73 (226 SE2d 599) (1976)</a></span>." Duvall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../103/72/index.html">238 Ga. 326</a></span> (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../103/72/index.html">232 SE2d 919 (1977)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Enumeration 6 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">6. In Enumeration 7, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in expressing the opinion of the Court in the statement, '[o]f course, it would be properly connected up, Mr. Hardin,' when appellant objected to nonexistent evidence arising out of a question asked by the District Attorney as to the whereabouts of a tee shirt found at the scene of the murder."</div><div class="casepar">It will facilitate understanding the obvious intent of the statement to consider the context in which it arose from page 178 of the transcript of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">"Q. All right. Is there any other evidence that was turned over to you that you may have turned over to somebody else? A. Well, there were some acid wipings identified as coming from the hands of Henry Phillips and an evidence bag containing a bloody tee shirt identified as being found at the scene. Q. And that tee shirt, I assume, was examined for human blood? A. I didn't examine it. Q. Who did you turn it over to? Mr. Hardin: At this point, if your Honor please, I don't believe there is any evidence that has been turned over to anyone, so I believe that would be out of order at this time. Mr. Goolsby: . . . turned over to him. The Court: Of course, it would be properly connected up, Mr. Hardin. Dr. Howard: It may take a minute . . . excuse me. Mr. Goolsby: I don't think it is really that important anyway. It doesn't make any difference. Just one second . . ."</div><div class="casepar">From reading the colloquy it is abundantly clear the trial court meant that be would require that it be properly connected up. No other interpretation can reasonably be made of the statement as made by the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, Enumeration 7 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">7. In Enumeration 8, the appellant alleges: "[t]he court erred in ruling that the defendant's, Judson Ruffin, confession was obtained freely and voluntarily by Agent Robert Ingram, in the presence of GBI Agent Monahan, and Investigators Dykes and Stevens of the Richmond County Sheriff's Department, while defendant was in Richmond County Jail in Augusta, Georgia, on August 29, 1976."</div><div class="casepar">Although the appellant states in his brief that this enumerated error must be abandoned, he also states that "the confession of appellant was neither freely nor voluntarily made by him." Nevertheless, inasmuch as a death sentence was imposed in this case we have reviewed that transcript of the Jackson-Denno hearing ( Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964)) and conclude that there was ample evidence to support the trial court's decision to admit the statement into evidence and to overrule the appellant's objection that the statement was not freely and voluntarily made.</div><div class="casepar">8. In Enumeration 9, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in admitting over objection, pictures of persons not on trial at this time, in the identification of the accused, Judson Ruffin."</div><div class="casepar">The thrust of the appellant's argument in support of this enumeration is that a GBI agent's testimony concerning the victim's identification of appellant's photograph was inadmissible hearsay. Agent Ingram was explaining that he had submitted a number of photographs to Mr. Phillips, the surviving victim-witness, and that Mr. Phillips had picked out the photograph of the appellant, Judson Ruffin. Both the enumeration and the argument are without merit. Roland v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../576/23/index.html">137 Ga. App. 796</a></span>, 799 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../576/23/index.html">224 SE2d 846</a></span>) (1976). Additionally, conversation may be admitted under Code Ann.  38-302 to explain conduct and as such is not considered hearsay. Arnold v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../110/20/index.html">236 Ga. 534 (224 SE2d 386) (1976)</a></span>; English v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/97/index.html">234 Ga. 602 (216 SE2d 851) (1975)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">9. In Enumeration 10, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in permitting the District Attorney, Kenneth E. Goolsby, to lead the accused into making voluntary statements of a criminal offense when he was 13 years of age, and a minor, in violation of Code Section 38-202 of the Code of Georgia."</div><div class="casepar">The appellant alleges the state put his character in evidence in violation of Code Ann.  38-202 and the state responds that the appellant opened the door and such inquiry was proper under Brown v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/01/index.html">237 Ga. 467</a></span>, 468 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../107/01/index.html">228 SE2d 853</a></span>) (1976). The district attorney asked, "What is your background?" and the appellant responded "[t]hat I don't have the education." The district attorney then asked, "What else is your background? Besides you don't have the education?" After the appellant responded "[o]kay, I went away when I was thirteen. I was sent off when I was thirteen," the appellant's counsel asked that the court stop counsel and at the court's direction that "[o]f course, he should not be led into a voluntary statement on his part," the state did not pursue that line of questioning any further.</div><div class="casepar">It is clear that the inquiry was stopped before the appellant's character was put in evidence inasmuch a there is no indication of who sent him off (it could have been his parents because they could not support him), why he was sent off, or where he was sent.</div><div class="casepar">Accordingly, Enumeration 10 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">10. In Enumeration 11, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in admitting to the record Exhibits Nos. 30, 32 and 33, indictments in Richmond County, Georgia, in 1967, while the accused was a minor aged 13 and 14 years, in Augusta, Georgia," in the sentencing phase of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">There is no evidence in the record which indicates that the appellant's juvenile record had been sealed pursuant to a court order as required by Code Ann.  24A-3504 (a); furthermore, these cases were tried in superior court and are subject to the criminal sanctions which may be imposed in that court, and as such are adjudications of guilt of a juvenile in superior court and and criminal adjudications. Carrindine v. Ricketts, <span class="casemissing">236 Ga. 283</span>, 285 (<span class="casemissing">223 SE2d 627</span>) (1967). The exhibits being otherwise in proper form, the trial court did not err in admitting them into evidence.</div><div class="casepar">11. In Enumeration 12, the appellant alleges "[t]he Court erred in denying appellant's motion to merge Count 2 with Count 1, which is the higher crime, and election must have been made at the close of the evidence by the State."</div><div class="casepar">The Georgia statute on included offenses provides that an accused cannot be convicted of more than one crime if one crime is included in the other. Appellant urges that his sentence for armed robbery (Count 2) merged in his conviction for murder (Count 5) and that under Atkins v. Hopper, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../115/25/index.html">234 Ga. 330 (216 SE2d 89) (1975)</a></span>, the conviction for armed robbery cannot stand under the "concurrent sentence doctrine." The concurrent sentence doctrine has no application in this situation. Appellant was indicted for malice murder, not felony murder, and the trial judge charged the jury on malice murder. The offense of armed robbery was not an included offense of malice murder and the trial judge properly refused to order the merger of the two offenses. Hawes v.

The kidnapping (Count 3) does not allege bodily harm and the murder (Count 5) alleges malice murder and not felony murder, the kidnapping of Bonnie Bulloch does not merge with the murder of Bonnie Bulloch. In addressing Enumeration 12, we have held that the armed robbery of Henry Phillips (Count 1) is not merged in the murder of Bonnie Bulloch (Count 5) for the same reason. Appellant also argues that the aggravated assault (Count 6) of Henry Phillips is merged with the kidnapping of Henry Phillips (Count 4) and cannot stand. Count 4 charging the kidnapping of Henry Phillips does not allege bodily injury and Count 6, aggravated assault, did not merge with Count 4.</div><div class="casepar">Enumeration 13 is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">Our remarks in Shy v.

In Shy this court held: "That appellant may not have told the truth was a permissible inference from the evidence. If the jury believed the state's witnesses, they could disbelieve the defendant's testimony. Such an inference could be drawn from the evidence and did not amount to a personal opinion by the prosecutor in his jury argument. See, Moore v.
