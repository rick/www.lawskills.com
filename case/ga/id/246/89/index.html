Before Judge Smith, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Defendant Travis Santel Murphy was charged in an indictment with murder (Count 1); felony murder (Counts 2 and 3); aggravated assault (Count 4); armed robbery (Count 5); and theft by taking (motor vehicle) (Count 6). The jury found him guilty of two counts of voluntary manslaughter as lesser offenses included within the indicted charges of murder and felony murder and also found him guilty of one count of aggravated assault, arising from the same incident in which the victim, Willie Harrison III, was shot and killed by a shotgun blast at close range. The charges were merged, and defendant was sentenced to 20 years on Count 1. Defendant's motion for new trial was denied, and this appeal followed. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. In his first enumeration, defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to give his requested charge regarding a criminal defendant's election not to testify. Defendant did not testify at trial. He submitted a written request (defendant's No. 15) to charge the substance of the pattern jury instruction, explaining his right to remain silent and prohibiting the jury from drawing any adverse inference from his exercise of this right. See Council of Superior Court Judges, Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases, Part 3 (N) (1991). From our review of the transcript of the charge conference, it appears the trial court indicated it would include defendant's Request Nos. "11, 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16 [in its instructions to the jury because they] are pattern." But the charge as given failed to include the promised language of defendant's Request No. 15. In the face of direct inquiry by the court, defendant reserved his exceptions to the charge.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The State maintains this enumeration lacks merit because defendant's requests to charge were not timely submitted. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant's requests were stamped by the clerk of the trial court as having been filed at 4:37 p.m. on December 5, 1995, which the State characterizes as being at the conclusion of the second day of trial. Defendant responds that the requests were presented to the trial court on the morning of December 5, 1995, prior to counsel's opening statements and subsequently file stamped by the clerk of the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">It is not necessary to determine the precise filing time of this particular request to charge, insofar as there is no contention it was not filed until after the jury returned its verdicts. Uniform Superior Court Rule 10.3 generally requires that all requests to charge be submitted to the trial court at the commencement of trial. But that rule contains the express proviso "that additional requests may be submitted to cover unanticipated points which arise thereafter." The decision whether to testify is a tactical one made by the accused himself after consultation with counsel. Burton v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../311/8/index.html">263 Ga. 725</a></span>, 728 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../311/8/index.html">438 SE2d 83</a></span>). There is no requirement that defendant make this decision until after he has heard the State's case. Consequently, a written request to charge premised on defendant's tactical decision not to testify cannot be untimely if submitted seasonably after that decision is reached during trial and before the case is submitted to the jury. Moreover, this is not a case where the trial court ruled the requests were untimely submitted and declined to consider them. Compare Walker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../301/78/index.html">213 Ga. App. 407</a></span>, 413 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../301/78/index.html">444 SE2d 824</a></span>); Dortch v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../332/41/index.html">204 Ga. App. 822</a></span>, 823 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../332/41/index.html">420 SE2d 778</a></span>); Webb v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/66/index.html">184 Ga. App. 89</a></span>, 90 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../398/66/index.html">360 SE2d 643</a></span>). Instead, the trial court in the case sub judice considered the merits of defendant's requested instructions and incorporated many of defendant's requests into the charge. Applying the presumption of regularity attached to the actions of the trial court, we hold that defendant's written requests to charge were in fact timely submitted.</div><div class="casepar">(b) "If a defendant in a criminal case wishes to testify and announces in open court his intention to do so, he may so testify in his own behalf. . . . The failure of a defendant to testify shall create no presumption against him, and no comment shall be made because of such failure." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/20/index.html">24-9-20</a></span> (b). See also Bennett v. State, <span class="casemissing">86 Ga. 401 (12 SE 806)</span>. "[A] state trial judge has the constitutional obligation, upon proper request, to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant's failure to testify." Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 305 (III) (101 SC 1112, 67 LE2d 241). "It necessarily follows, as a matter of logical reasoning, that when a proper charge on this subject is timely requested by the defendant, it is error for the trial judge to fail to give it." Clay v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/86/index.html">236 Ga. 398</a></span>, 399 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/86/index.html">224 SE2d 14</a></span>). Accord Culbertson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/18/index.html">193 Ga. App. 9</a></span>, 11 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/18/index.html">386 SE2d 894</a></span>). Compare Woodard v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../117/20/index.html">234 Ga. 901</a></span>, 903 (7), 905 (7) (b), 906 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../117/20/index.html">218 SE2d 629</a></span>) (no error in failing to so charge, in absence of a timely written request).</div><div class="casepar">(c) All charging errors are presumed to be prejudicial and harmful, and this Court will so hold, unless it appears from the entire record that the error was harmless. Foskey v. Foskey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/3/index.html">257 Ga. 736 (2)</a></span>, 737 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/3/index.html">363 SE2d 547</a></span>); Austin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../285/20/index.html">218 Ga. App. 90</a></span>, 91 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../285/20/index.html">460 SE2d 310</a></span>). While the trial court did charge on presumption of innocence and burden of proof, those "other trial instructions and arguments of counsel . . . were no substitute for the explicit instruction that [defendant's] lawyer requested. . . . Without question, the Fifth Amendment privilege and the presumption of innocence are closely aligned. But these principles serve different functions. . . ." Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. at 304 (II) (C), supra. Nevertheless, in our view of the case sub judice, the erroneous omission constitutes harmless error. Due to the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, it is highly probable that defendant's failure to testify did not contribute to the verdict. The failure to give defendant's timely requested and proper instruction, under the particular circumstances of this case, was not error requiring a new trial. Cauley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../596/21/index.html">130 Ga. App. 278</a></span>, 286 (2) (a), 288 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../596/21/index.html">203 SE2d 239</a></span>). Compare Clay v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/86/index.html">236 Ga. 398</a></span>, 399, supra.</div><div class="casepar">2. The trial court did not err in denying the motion of defendant, who was 13 years of age at the time of the shooting, to transfer the case to the juvenile court. This motion was based on an equal protection challenge to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/5/index.html">15-11-5</a></span> (b), an issue which was determined adversely to defendant's contentions by the Supreme Court of Georgia in the recent decision of Bishop v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../253/2/index.html">265 Ga. 821</a></span>, 823 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../253/2/index.html">462 SE2d 716</a></span>). Moreover, defendant was charged with murder, for which the superior court had exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/5/index.html">15-11-5</a></span> (b) (2) (A) (i), and consequently, "those statutory rights accorded juveniles in juvenile court procedures no longer appl[ied]." Appling v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../277/25/index.html">221 Ga. App. 162 (1)</a></span>, 163 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../277/25/index.html">470 SE2d 761</a></span>). Nor, in our view, did the superior court err in refusing to transfer the case to juvenile court for sentencing after defendant was convicted of an offense in which the courts would share jurisdiction. Reynolds v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../203/7/index.html">266 Ga. 235</a></span>, 236 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../203/7/index.html">466 SE2d 218</a></span>). The fourth and fifth enumerations are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. After the close of the evidence, the trial court recessed for the charge conference. During this recess, two jurors sent out notes indicating they were already deliberating the case, even before closing arguments and the charge of the court. The trial court informed them that "[m]ost of the questions presented in [the] notes will be answered by the charge," and promptly instructed the jury "not [to] begin any deliberations until you hear the closing arguments and the charge of the Court as to the law." Defendant's second and third enumerations claim a mistrial was demanded because of the premature deliberations, complicated by the presence of the alternate jurors during those deliberations. But no such motion was made to the trial court, nor any contemporaneous objection interposed. Consequently, the errors alleged in these enumerations were not preserved for appellate review. Peterson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/52/index.html">212 Ga. App. 31</a></span>, 32 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../303/52/index.html">441 SE2d 267</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">4. The trial court admitted into evidence a transcript of defendant's recorded call to the emergency 911 service, wherein defendant identified himself as "the shooter," admitting he shot his cousin Willie Harrison because the victim "kept provoking . . . and provoking . . . and provoking [defendant]." According to this transcribed call, the victim "spit on [defendant] the other night. He pushed [and] punched defendant, [and] had knives at [defendant] the other night." Then, defendant noticed the police approaching and was persuaded to surrender himself into police custody without further incident. Defendant moved to suppress this recording contending it amounted to custodial interrogation without proper cautioning of his rights. The denial of this motion is enumerated as error.</div><div class="casepar">The only incriminating statement defendant made in this call was the statement "I'm the shooter." This was volunteered by defendant in response to the 911 operator's query, "Okay, who is this?" The trial court correctly admitted this evidence over defendant's objection that no warnings as prescribed by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (86 SC 1602, 16 LE2d 694) preceded his volunteered statement. Leatherwood v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/72/index.html">212 Ga. App. 342</a></span>, 343 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/72/index.html">441 SE2d 813</a></span>). See also Jenkins v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../283/39/index.html">219 Ga. App. 339</a></span>, 340 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../283/39/index.html">465 SE2d 296</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">5. Investigator Jeffrey Richards of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office testified at trial that, after the charges were upgraded to murder, he explained to defendant he would be tried as an adult "and advised him of his Miranda rights, [after which defendant] said that he and the victim had been arguing for a few weeks and that he [defendant] had gotten the shells to the gun sometime last week and put them in his bedroom. [Defendant] stated the victim was a bully and had been hitting on him and had spit in his face the other day. [Defendant] stated that when the argument happened [the day of the shooting] the victim had been slapping him in the face and that when [defendant] went and got the gun that the victim told [defendant] to go ahead and shoot . . . but that [defendant] thought about it and put the gun down and the argument continued. During one of the next times that [defendant] picked up the gun the victim took it away from him and held it for a while and then handed it back to [defendant] and said shoot me. During the last time that [defendant] had the gun the victim pushed [defendant] onto the couch and this caused . . . [defendant] to jerk and the gun went off."</div><div class="casepar">Defendant moved to suppress this statement. At the voluntariness hearing, only Investigator Jeff Richards of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office testified, and his evidence authorized the following facts: Investigator Richards investigated "the scene of the shooting incident [and] knew there was a dead person. . . ." His first contact with defendant was at the station, where defendant was already in custody. The following chronology is undisputed: Defendant was in the custody of the Carrollton Police Department "around 3:00 p.m. or about ten minutes after." At approximately 4:30 p.m., custody of defendant was transferred from the Carrollton Police Department to the Carroll County Sheriff's Department. He was permitted to telephone his mother between "4:30 and 4:45 p.m." At 5:30 p.m., Investigator Richards contacted the juvenile court intake officer. At 6:15 p.m., Investigator Richards explained defendant's rights to him but then decided against taking a statement. But defendant persisted.</div><div class="casepar">In the presence of Investigator Richards and Sergeant Howard Lee, defendant "told his mother that he had in fact shot [the victim], that [the victim] had been spitting on him. That [the victim] had taken [defendant's] [N]intendo game because the victim had accused the Defendant of taking some of his money."</div><div class="casepar">Subsequently, "when the charge had been upgraded to murder [defendant] had heard a conversation between the assistant district attorney and [Investigator Richards] and said, you know, that's not the way it happened. I [defendant] want to tell my side. [Investigator Richards] prepared a Miranda form, read [defendant] his Miranda rights and was about to have him execute it [when Investigator Richards] decided at that point [and] said, I'm not going to have you [defendant] sign it [the waiver of rights form]. I don't want to take your statement[;] you're better off not making a statement. . . . [But defendant] continued on and eventually gave a statement. Not a question/answer type thing, he just went through a statement, a brief synopsis of what had happened." Despite deciding not to have defendant sign a waiver of his rights, Investigator Richards "asked a couple of questions clarifying what he had said . . . but not what [Investigator Richards considered] an outright interrogation or [else he] would have most likely tape recorded it." Defendant never "wanted to not make a statement, [nor] wanted to stop making a statement."</div><div class="casepar">Applying the nine factors enumerated in Riley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../105/91/index.html">237 Ga. 124</a></span>, 128 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../105/91/index.html">226 SE2d 922</a></span>), the trial court determined that the age of the accused was thirteen at the time of the incident; he was in the seventh grade; and he had knowledge of the nature of the charges against him at the time he made his initial statement to his mother on the telephone and also when he made his subsequent statement to Investigator Richards. Defendant was permitted to talk to his mother in Ohio and was not interrogated at that time. The length of the subsequent interrogation was very brief. From this the trial court concluded that defendant's initial statements to his mother were spontaneous and not in response to any custodial interrogation and that his subsequent statement to Investigator Richards was voluntary.</div><div class="casepar">On appeal, defendant objects to these evidentiary rulings, contending that his statements were not spontaneous or voluntary, and further objecting because defendant was detained and interrogated without any showing of compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/11/19/index.html">15-11-19</a></span> (a) (1) through (4).</div><div class="casepar">(a) The trial court's determination that defendant's statements on the telephone to his mother were spontaneous and not in response to custodial interrogation is supported by the evidence, is not clearly erroneous, and consequently is affirmed.

C. Higgins 12-gauge pump action shotgun. The jury convicted Murphy of voluntary manslaughter. Murphy's defense was justification and accident, and the trial court charged on both.</div><div class="casepar">In support of his defense, Murphy called six defense witnesses, four of whom testified regarding two acts of aggression on the part of the victim. One of these witnesses testified that the victim picked up a knife during an argument with his stepmother. These witnesses did not testify as to the incident that led to the victim's death, nor did they testify regarding acts of aggression by the victim toward Murphy. However, the defense also called a DFCS caseworker who was permitted to testify extensively as to what Murphy told her about the shooting immediately after it happened: "He [Travis Murphy] told me that he was in the house playing a video game and his cousin came in and started screaming and yelling at him that he stole his eight dollars. Travis told him he did not steal the eight dollars. His cousin kept yelling and screaming, told Travis he was going to take the video game that Travis was playing and Travis told him, no, he wasn't. At that point the cousin jerked Travis up and started pitching him around. There was some little kids in the room. Travis told the kids to leave the room. The cousin kept pushing Travis. At that point somehow Travis got a gun. He told the cousin to stop. The cousin kept coming towards him. He told him to stop or he would shoot and at that point the cousin told him, said, you better shoot to kill -- you better shoot me and kill me because if you don't I'm going to kill you or shoot you, something to that effect." The DFCS worker testified that appellant Travis Murphy told her he was "scared" of the victim, because the victim was going to "get the gun away from him [Murphy] and shoot him." The witness testified that Murphy "didn't want to do it [shoot], but he [the victim] kept coming towards him." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">During the State's case-in-chief, Murphy's statement to the police also was introduced: "[H]e said that he and the victim had been arguing for a few weeks and that he had gotten the shells to the gun sometime last week and put them in his bedroom. He stated the victim was a bully and had been hitting on him and had spit in his face the other day. He stated that when the argument happened today that the victim had been slapping him in the face and that when he, Mr. Murphy, went and got the gun that the victim told Mr. Murphy to go ahead and shoot him but that he, Mr. Murphy, thought about it and put the gun down and the argument continued. During one of the next times that Mr. Murphy picked up the gun the victim took it away from him and held it for awhile and then handed it back to the offender, Mr. Murphy and said shoot me. During the last time that Mr. Murphy had the gun the victim pushed him onto the couch and this caused the gun -- caused Mr. Murphy to jerk and the gun went off." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">The State also introduced Murphy's statements to his mother made while he was on the telephone at the police station: "[H]e told his mother the he had in fact shot Travis [sic], that Travis [sic] had been spitting on him. That he had taken his [N]intendo game because the victim had accused the Defendant of taking some of his money."</div><div class="casepar">In addition, an eyewitness, a ten-year-old relative of both Murphy and the victim, testified regarding the shooting. The boy testified that Murphy and the victim were arguing. There was no pushing, shoving, or fist fight -- "[t]hey were just yelling at each other." Murphy left the living room and entered a bedroom closet to get the shotgun. When he returned to the living room with the shotgun, Murphy pointed it at the victim's "middle" and shot him. There was no physical contact between the two. In that regard, the pathologist testified that the victim's wound went from the middle of the abdomen to the back, as State's Exhibit 4 also shows; the doctor testified that there was no evidence of upward movement of the weapon's blast into the abdomen or chest cavity so as to support the idea that the weapon was fired from a sitting position on the couch into the victim who was standing above.</div><div class="casepar">1. Here, Murphy did not "fail to testify" so as to make the omission of the challenged jury instruction reversible error. Indeed, Murphy was permitted to put his own testimony before the jury during the defense case-in-chief through the testimony of the DFCS caseworker. Further, he did not have to be cross-examined with regard thereto. The jury heard Murphy's "side of the story" through Murphy's own statement, introduced by Murphy.

Notably, at that point, Murphy never stated that he felt he was in imminent danger of death or receiving serious bodily harm from the victim's actions, the essential elements of self-defense. Instead, at that point, Murphy was angry because the victim was pushing him around in an attempt to take his video game; justification goes to defense of self or others, not video games.

Murphy's statement to his mother was that Murphy deliberately shot the victim solely because the victim spit on him and took his video game.</div><div class="casepar">Thus, even taking as true the evidence introduced by the State and the defense, as a matter of law, this evidence did not establish the elements of either self-defense or accident so as to justify the homicide of the victim.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The State's evidence of the elements of homicide was overwhelming. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> The State introduced eyewitness testimony that Murphy deliberately obtained a shotgun and shot the victim without any physical provocation or threats. The State introduced expert testimony from the doctor who performed the autopsy and the firearms expert which negated the possibility that the shotgun just "went off" as recounted by Murphy to the police. Further, the State introduced Murphy's statements to his mother and the police in which Murphy admitted to the shooting but in which the elements of justification for the shooting were not established. Accordingly, the State's evidence demanded a verdict of guilty of homicide, as a matter of law.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Accordingly, in light of the above, the jury could not have given "evidentiary weight" to Murphy's failure to testify so as to effect a verdict which was demanded as a matter of law. The failure to give the omitted jury charge, while error, was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">Peter J. Skandalakis, District Attorney, Kevin W.

      Voluntary manslaughter is a homicide mitigated by passion. Accordingly, such crime demonstrates the elements of what "would otherwise be murder" if not for the additional presence of "serious provocation sufficient to excite . . . passion in a reasonable person." See Title 16, Article 5, Homicide; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/2/index.html">16-5-2</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
