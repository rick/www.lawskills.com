DeKalb State Court. Before Judge Robins.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This malpractice case involves mental health issues and the statute of limitation as to such actions. All appeals raise such issues of the statute of limitation but state the issues, in a number of different ways. Case Nos. A98A1503, A98A1504, and A98A1505 raise exclusively such issues, while Case No. A98A1506 raises additional issues that will not be reached.</div><div class="casepar">Ms. Kohout has a history of mental health illness dating to 1987, which history pre-dates treatment by the defendants, of an eating disorder, depression, suicidal ideation, auditory hallucination, and reported sexual abuse by her father. In June 1990, plaintiff was diagnosed by Dr. Ann Gustin, a psychologist, as having multiple personality disorder ("MPD"), and Dr. Gustin treated the plaintiff for MPD in 1990. While in therapy with Dr. Gustin, plaintiff engaged in physical abuse of herself, including cutting her body.</div><div class="casepar">In August 1990, plaintiff began therapy at the same time with defendant Dr. Donna Ulrici, a psychologist, who is not a defendant-appellant. Dr. Ulrici learned of Dr. Gustin's diagnosis of MPD and concurred in the diagnosis. Plaintiff terminated her treatment with Dr. Gustin.</div><div class="casepar">In March 1991, Dr. Ulrici admitted plaintiff to the Eating Disorder Unit at Charter Peachford Hospital ("Charter") where she remained until August 1991. Plaintiff alleges that Charter, Christine Engstrom, Dr. Grace Cobiella, and Dr. Fiameta Vargas, defendants-appellants, forced her through therapy to believe that she had a MPD with dozens of "altered personalities"; that she had been sexually abused by family members; and that such abuse occurred during satanic cult ceremonies. Plaintiff contends this is a misdiagnosis. Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Ulrici, with the assistance of the other defendants, used improper therapy or used therapy in an improper way through "memory work," "guided imagery," "body memories," and hypnosis, as well as drug therapy, resulting in recovered memory and causing plaintiff to believe that she had been abused sexually by her family during satanic rituals and that she had a MPD as a result. Thus, using improper therapy, plaintiff recovered "repressed" memories of sexual and satanic ritual abuse, which eliminated any doubts that she had as to her diagnosis through the institutionalized nature of Charter's therapy.</div><div class="casepar">From August 21, 1991 until August 26, 1991, plaintiff was admitted to CPC Parkwood Hospital ("Parkwood"). Plaintiff alleges that Parkwood negligently accepted the admission diagnosis of Dr. Ulrici and the other defendants without performing available and competent tests to independently establish the nature of plaintiff's mental condition.</div><div class="casepar">From December 1991 until February 1992, plaintiff was again hospitalized at Charter and underwent the same treatment as during previous hospitalizations.</div><div class="casepar">Subsequently, plaintiff intentionally cut herself, requiring 40 stitches. She was hospitalized at Parkwood from August 5, 1992 until September 3, 1992, and then again from October 8, 1992 until October 12, 1992.</div><div class="casepar">In November 1992, plaintiff began work as a full-time nanny for Dr. Elizabeth Goey until August 1994. From August 1994 until December 1994, plaintiff worked full-time as a nanny for Ms. Lauretta Russell.</div><div class="casepar">From August 17, 1994 until August 19, 1994, plaintiff was again hospitalized at Parkwood. However, other than such hospitalization, plaintiff had no further treatment or clinical care from the defendants-appellants, except Dr. Ulrici. In February 1995, plaintiff discontinued her treatment with Dr. Ulrici.</div><div class="casepar">On November 25, 1995, plaintiff filed her original complaint alleging medical malpractice in misdiagnosing and treating her. On March 25, 1996, plaintiff filed her amended complaint against the defendants and added Parkwood. The defendants-appellants filed their motions for summary judgment based upon the running of the statute of limitation. The trial court entered an order denying all summary judgment motions. The defendants-appellants applied for a discretionary appeal which was applied for and granted. Dr. Ulrici did not seek a discretionary appeal.</div><div class="casepar">All the defendants-appellants, in various ways, contend that the trial court erred in not finding that the statute of limitation barred plaintiff's action against them. We agree that summary judgment on the running of the statute of limitation should have been granted to the defendants-appellants as to injuries arising on or before October 12, 1992.</div><div class="casepar">(a) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/70/index.html">9-3-70</a></span> (1) and (2) defines an "action for medical malpractice" so broadly for purposes of the statute of limitation that the defendant medical doctors, psychologists, mental hospitals, and the dietician all come within the act. See Bradway v. American Nat. Red Cross, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../287/1/index.html">263 Ga. 19</a></span> (<span class="casemissing">4210 Ga. App. 726</span>, 727 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/48/index.html">437 SE2d 475</a></span>) (1993); Allrid v. Emory Univ., <span class="casemissing">166 Ga.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/71/index.html">9-3-71</a></span> (a) mandates that a medical malpractice action must be brought "within two years after the date on which an injury . . . arising from a negligent or wrongful act or omission occurred."</div><div class="casepar">In this case, plaintiff's alleged misdiagnosis and treatment, including the representations that she had been sexually abused by a family member and that the sexual abuse was part of a satanic ritual, were injuries that occurred and became manifested at the same time of the defendant's acts or omissions, were manifested prior to the running of the statute. Plaintiff in her complaint and amended complaint seeks to recover for mental pain and suffering from the inception of the misdiagnosis and treatment, as well as for special damages for unnecessary, improper treatment and hospitalizations, which means that damages, i.e., general, special, or nominal, occurred and became manifested at the time of the misdiagnosis. See Shessel v. Stroup, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../606/6/index.html">253 Ga. 56 (316 SE2d 155) (1984)</a></span>; Everhart v.

Oxley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../119/7/index.html">269 Ga. 82 (495 SE2d 39) (1998)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">"In most misdiagnosis cases, the injury begins immediately upon the misdiagnosis due to the pain, suffering or economic loss sustained by the patient from the time of the misdiagnosis until the medical problem is properly diagnosed and treated. [Cit.] The misdiagnosis itself is the injury and not the subsequent discovery of the proper diagnosis. [Cit.]" Whitaker v. Zirkle, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../387/42/index.html">188 Ga. App. 706</a></span>, 707 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../387/42/index.html">374 SE2d 106</a></span>) (1988); see Jones v. Lamon, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/36/index.html">206 Ga. App. 842</a></span>, 846 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../325/36/index.html">426 SE2d 657</a></span>) (1992); Stone v. Radiology Svcs., P.

Thus, in this case, plaintiff suffered mental pain and suffering from the inception of the misdiagnosis, if not physical pain and suffering as well, and special damages from the alleged needless hospitalizations and therapy sessions. This is not a situation where the injury was concealed but was revealed to plaintiff at the time of the act or omission by the disclosure of the diagnosis to her, because the consequences to plaintiff were ascertainable and known to her from the inception of the wrongful acts or omissions, whether or not she appreciated the medical cause. Allrid v. Emory Univ., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../698/6/index.html">249 Ga. 35</a></span>, 36 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../742/2/index.html">285 SE2d 521</a></span>) (1982); Everhart v. Rich's, Inc., supra at 802; Bryant v. Crider, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../315/25/index.html">209 Ga. App. 623 (434 SE2d 161) (1993)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">While plaintiff may have later learned that defendant's diagnosis and treatment was made in error, causing her mental pain and suffering at that time in 1995, plaintiff and plaintiff alone was always in the unique position of knowing from the commencement of treatment and the alleged misdiagnosis (despite the suggestions, hypnosis, or influence of the defendants) whether she had been sexually abused by a family member and if the abuse came from satanic practices, as evidenced by the fact that she later came to reject such diagnosis. Plaintiff had mental suffering at the time of the misdiagnosis in 1990 from the belief that she had a MPD and had been abused as a child by family members during satanic rituals; at that time, she suffered isolation and alienation from her family as a consequence of the misdiagnosis and therapy</div><div class="casepar">Damages, i.e., manifested compensable injuries, whether general, special, or nominal damages, begin the running of the statute of limitation in misdiagnosis cases, and the failure to know the medical cause of the damage until later does not give rise to the application of the "discovery rule," where damages occurred concurrently with the wrongful acts or omission so that the cause of action then accrued. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/71/index.html">9-3-71</a></span> (a); Ford v. Dove, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../287/56/index.html">218 Ga.

Crider, supra at 626 (3); Jones v. Lamon, supra at 846. Thus, there was no subsequent discovery of the injury; plaintiff always was aware of the injury and only later came to reject the diagnosis and treatment as false. See Henry v. Medical Center, supra at 894; Crawford v. Spencer, supra at 448; Whitaker v. Zirkle, supra.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The "continuing tort" theory is inapplicable to actions for medical malpractice, since it would nullify the intent of the General Assembly that, after five years, no medical malpractice action could be brought, even when a disability attaches to toll the running of the statute because the statute of repose abolishes any action five years after the negligent or wrongful act or omission. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/71/index.html">9-3-71</a></span>; Crawford v. Spencer, supra; see also Ford v. Dove, supra at 829 (2) Hickey v.

OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/71/index.html">9-3-71</a></span> (b) creates a statute of repose so that no cause of action for medical malpractice exists five years after the negligent or wrongful act or omission; the right of action is abrogated by statute as if it never existed. See Craven v. Lowndes County Hosp. Auth., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../309/7/index.html">263 Ga. 657 (437 SE2d 308) (1993)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">If the injury, i.e., damage, is not manifested so that it is discoverable until two or more years after the negligent or wrongful act or omission, then under the plain meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/71/index.html">9-3-71</a></span> (a), the statute of limitation does not commence to run until an injury is manifested, i.e., discovery or reasonable opportunity for discovery of the injury. The tort does not accrue until there are damages, i.e., injury or death, to commence the running of the statute of limitation. See Clark v. Singer, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../684/8/index.html">250 Ga. 470</a></span>, 471 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../684/8/index.html">298 SE2d 484</a></span>) (1983); Screven v. Drs.

Discovery should occur when damages first become manifest; without damages, no tort action accrues in order to commence the running of the statute of limitation. Shessel v. Stroup, supra at 57; Everhart v. Rich's, Inc., supra at 802; Screven v. Drs. Gruskin &amp; Lucas, P.C., supra at 758; Oxley v. Kilpatrick, supra at 839-840; Whitaker v.

Thus, plaintiff was not debarred or deterred from knowing that she had a cause of action for an alleged misdiagnosis by defendants-appellants' acts or omissions. Plaintiff subsequently came to believe that the earlier diagnosis was incorrect; both positions were based upon the same knowledge in her possession, but were interpreted in different ways.

Mental incapacity that tolls the statute is the unsound mind that renders the plaintiff incapable of acting for him or herself in order to carry on her business, to undertake or maintain a suit for the recovery of her property, to prosecute her claim, and to manage the ordinary affairs of life.

Hickey v. Askren, supra at 719-721 (2). While plaintiff may have been mentally ill, even assuming the alleged misdiagnosis was correct that plaintiff suffered from MPD and an eating disorder, plaintiff's testimony did not show that she was incapable of carrying out her day-to-day life activities and making decisions, even though she was hospitalized for treatment. The record shows that she did, with some emotional difficulty, carry on her daily ability to make decisions. She had the mental capacity to voluntarily admit herself for treatment and to be discharged from hospitals. Plaintiff was not legally incompetent within the meaning of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/73/index.html">9-3-73</a></span> (b) so as to toll the statute of limitation.</div><div class="casepar">(e) For purpose of determining when an injury from a misdiagnosis occurred as the consequence of acts or omissions of the defendants, each defendant's acts or omissions must be separately analyzed and determined as concurring in the cause of the original injury or in aggravation of such injury; where the acts or omissions of the defendants concurrently caused an indivisible injury or aggravated a preexisting injury, the statute begins to run for each such defendant at the time the injury occurred from the tort and manifests any damages or at the date the injury was subsequently aggravated by each defendant's acts or omissions. See generally Stone v. Radiology Svcs., P.A., supra at 852 (2); Jones v. Lamon, supra at 844-846; Gay v. Piggly Wiggly Southern, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../403/02/index.html">183 Ga.

In the case of a misdiagnosis that does not manifest any damages at the time of the act or omission, but does result in damages at a later time, the statute of limitation commences to run upon discovery of the damages. Shessel v. Stroup, supra at 56; Staples v. Bhatti, supra at 406; Knight v. Sturm, supra at 391; Vitner v. Miller, supra at 307; Whitaker v. Zirkle, supra. However, the subsequent act or omission of a tortfeasor causing subsequent injury does not extend the statute of limitation to such subsequent injury for other tortfeasors, because such subsequent act or omission is an independent tortious act aggravating a pre-existing injury. See Jones v. Lamon, supra at 846. But, if the subsequent tortious act brings about the indivisible injury where no injury previously existed, i.e., the straw that broke the camel's back, then all previous tortfeasors would be joint tortfeasors in the discovered and manifested injury. See Whitaker v. Zirkle, supra. However, in this case, the damages accrued concurrently with the alleged wrongful conduct, not subsequently.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, plaintiff suffered special damages, as well as general damages or at least nominal damages, at the date of the alleged misdiagnosis by Dr. Ulrici. Therefore, any damages sustained by the plaintiff between October 12, 1992, and February 1995, when plaintiff discharged Dr. Ulrici, were further aggravation of a pre-existing injury, affecting the statute of limitation as to Dr. Ulrici only.</div><div class="casepar">Absent a partnership, the joint treatment of a patient by health care providers does not create a joint venture as a matter of public policy, allowing the wrongful conduct of one health care provider to be imputed to another health care provider. Rossi v. Oxley, supra. Separate from public policy considerations, absent joint right of control and sharing of profits and losses, a joint venture cannot legally exist between health care providers.
