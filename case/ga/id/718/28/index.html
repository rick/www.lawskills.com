The first special ground of the motion for a new trial is expressly abandoned by the defendants.</div><div class="casepar">2. Ordinarily a refusal to give in charge to the jury, substantially in the language requested, a timely, pertinent, and legal instruction, which is properly adjusted to one or more issues arising out of the evidence, and which is specific in its application thereto, is ground for a new trial, although in principle and in more abstract terms the charge requested may have been covered in the charge of the court generally.</div><div class="casepar">3. In view of the ruling made in division 2 hereof, the recharge excepted to in special ground 3, though inaccurate, is not likely to be given upon another trial.</div><div class="casepar">4. The evidence did not demand a verdict for the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">Floyd J. Lowman filed suit against L. P. Jones and Clyde Kindal, on open account for $956.40 principal with interest from February 21, 1947, an itemized and verified copy of the account being attached to the petition, showing the purchase by the defendants from the plaintiff of 804 gallons of syrup at $1.35 a gallon, totalling $1085.45, with a credit by payment of $129.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant, Clyde Kindal, filed his answer, denying the indebtedness, and setting up that the plaintiff sold the syrup for the defendant to use in making whisky, to be paid therefor in whisky, and thereafter accepted from him 66 gallons of whisky at $3 a gallon and 12 gallons of brandy at $7 a gallon, and also $30 in cash; and that, as he had no license to make intoxicating liquor, the contract sued on is based upon an illegal consideration and is illegal and not enforceable. The defendant Jones denied that he owed the account sued on, and set up that the syrup was delivered on April 8, 1946, and the account was barred by the statute of limitations; and also that he informed the plaintiff's son, upon finding the syrup at his place, that he did not want it, and the plaintiff would have to look to Kindal for "the carrying out of the agreement with reference to the use of the syrup and the method of payment." He further sets up that the "contract for the sole use and method of payment was made between the plaintiff and Kindal." The case proceeded to trial, and resulted in a verdict against both defendants for $956.40 principal and $66.95 interest. The defendants moved for a new trial on the general grounds, and by amendment added three special grounds. The court denied this motion, and the defendants except.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. Error is assigned in special ground 1 on the following charge: "There is no contention about the amount being correct, so far as the amount is concerned. And if you find for the plaintiff your verdict would be for $956.40, besides interest on that at the rate of seven percent per annum from the time the evidence shows it became due, if the evidence does show that, if the evidence doesn't show when it became due then you would figure that interest at seven percent per annum from the time that the evidence shows, if it does, that Mr. Lowman made demand for payment of it. If the evidence doesn't show what time, what particular time he made demand for the payment of it, then you would figure interest from time of the filing of the suit, on $956.40, at seven percent, if you otherwise find for the plaintiff."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant contends that this charge was error because there was evidence authorizing the jury to render &amp; verdict for a lesser sum than that sued for, to wit, $773. The plaintiff voluntarily reduced the verdict and judgment rendered from $956.40 and interest to $773, and the defendants, in their brief, expressly abandon this ground.</div><div class="casepar">2. In special ground 2, the defendants contend that the court erred in not charging the jury, same being properly requested, as follows: "The plaintiff Lowman contends that he had no knowledge of the fact that the defendants were going to use this syrup he furnished them or sold them in the illegal manufacture of intoxicating liquors; however, under the law I have just given you in charge, if you find from the evidence such facts and circumstances which are inconsistent with the truth of his sworn testimony to that effect, then you would have the right to disbelieve his sworn testimony and believe otherwise. I further charge you that if from the facts and circumstances as shown by the evidence you should find that the plaintiff Lowman did have knowledge of the intended illegal use of this syrup, then your verdict should be for the defendants, Jones and Kindal."</div><div class="casepar">It was error for the court to refuse to give such requested charge, which was legal, apt, and precisely adjusted to the defendants' contention to be considered by the jury, "in applying the general principle to this one of the several matters for their consideration." Thompson v. Thompson, <span class="casemissing">77 Ga. 692</span> (3 S. E. 261). Also see Central of Ga. Ry. Co. v. Goodman, <span class="casemissing">119 Ga. 234</span> (45 S. E. 969). "It is error . . . to refuse to charge a special written request made by defendant's counsel, which is legal and adjusted to a distinct matter in issue, involving plaintiff's right to recover, although the principle of such request may be covered in general and abstract terms by other instructions of the court." Snowden v. Waterman &amp; Co., <span class="casemissing">105 Ga. 384 (5)</span> (31 S. E. 110).</div><div class="casepar">"Ordinarily a refusal to give in charge to the jury, substantially in the language requested in writing, a timely, pertinent, and legal instruction, which is properly adjusted to one or more issues arising out of the evidence and which is specific in its application thereto, is ground for new trial, although in principle and in more abstract terms the charge requested may have been covered by other instructions given by the court." Werk v. Big Bunker Hill Mining Corp., <span class="casemissing">193 Ga. 217 (4)</span> (17 S. E. 2d, 825). In the Werk case, the late Mr. Justice Warren Grice, speaking for the Supreme Court, wrote exhaustively on the question presented in this special ground, citing and dealing with many authorities pro and con, including Thompson v. Thompson, supra, and Central of Ga. Ry. Co. v. Goodman, supra, and reached the conclusion now reached by this court, that it is error to fail to give such as requested instruction, even though the court charged generally the principle covered by the request. See item beginning on page 225 to middle of page 234. Justice Bell concurred specially, but not as to the above question, the ruling made being specifically assented to except that Mr. Justice Bell did not agree that there was a conflict in the previous rulings of the Supreme Court on this question, but said, "I am agreeing in this case that it was error to refuse the request." Werk v. Big Bunker Hill Mining Corp., pp. 235, 236-240. Because of the error assigned in this special ground, the trial court committed reversible error in not granting a new trial, for a new trial ought to have been granted.</div><div class="casepar">3. While the recharge, assigned as error in special ground 3, is not entirely accurate and adjusted to the facts, the court, in view of the ruling made in division 2 hereof, is not likely so to charge the jury on a second trial.</div><div class="casepar">4. In view of the fact that a new trial is granted because of the refusal of the court to give the request dealt with in division 2 hereof, it is unnecessary to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence, except to state that a verdict for the plaintiff was not demanded.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
