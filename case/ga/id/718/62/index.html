Under the ruling of this court in Overstreet v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. App. 483</span> (43 S. E. 2d, 774), the amended plea of the defendant sureties that they were released in that they had furnished to the plaintiff creditor a written notice as provided for in Code  103-205 being proper, and there being evidence in support thereof, the judgment of the trial judge, acting as both judge and jury by consent of the parties, finding in favor of such amended plea and that the defendants had been released was not erroneously rendered for any of the reasons assigned.</div><div class="casepar">The subject-matter of this litigation has been in the courts of this State for several years. It began when a suit was brought by the W. T. Rawleigh Company (hereinafter called the plaintiff) in the City Court of Louisville against Hoke S. Williams, as principal, J. W. Overstreet, W. T. J. Davis and J. W. Cato. (Overstreet and Davis hereinafter called defendants Cato never having been served) as sureties, upon a contract between said company and Williams dated September 29, 1929, and expiring December 31, 1930. The other named defendants, Overstreet, Davis and Cato, were sureties for the principal defendant, Williams, on this contract. Upon the expiration of this contract, another contract was entered into between the said W. T. Rawleigh Company and Williams, dated January 31, 1931, for a year. J. W. Cato and T. A. Forbes were sureties for Williams on this contract. The suit is also brought against Cato and Forbes on this undertaking. The said W. T. J. Davis died and his administrator, W. G. Davis, was made a party defendant in his stead. The present suit involved the contracts above mentioned. The defendant Williams purchased thereunder several orders of goods from the plaintiff for which it is alleged he did not pay the purchase-price. Williams bought goods under the first contract, and the plaintiff sues for a balance of $764.30 thereon, suing the principal Williams and the sureties Overstreet, Davis and Cato, and the said Williams also bought goods of the plaintiff, after the expiration of the first contract, and there remained a balance of $71.25 due thereon for which the suit is brought. Reference is made to the report of this case when it was first before this court for a full statement of the facts and the provisions of said contracts. See W. T. Rawleigh Company v. Overstreet, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. App. 873</span> (32 S. E. 2d, 574). It was claimed that the two sureties on the latter contract, Cato and Forbes, were liable for the entire indebtedness of Williams to the plaintiff under both contracts, there being a provision in the latter contract whereby the sureties for Williams agreed to become liable for "all goods, wares and merchandise previously sold to said buyer under and by virtue of any and all prior contracts or agreements." In this suit service was perfected upon J. W. Overstreet and T. W. Forbes, but no service was had upon Williams, the principal, nor upon Cato, the surety on both contracts. W. J. T. Davis being deceased when the action was brought, no service was had upon him, but said W. G. Davis, having been appointed as his administrator,</div><div class="casepar">was, by request, made a party defendant. The sureties contended that under the contract they were not sureties but guarantors, and that there could be no liability as to them jointly with the principal debtor, Williams, and that all that they had guaranteed was the solvency of Williams. This court held that they were sureties, and also ruled that the second contract between the plaintiff and Williams, to which Cato and Forbes were sureties, did not operate to release the defendants, Overstreet and Davis, administrator, as sureties on the first contract, but that such contract simply amounted to giving to the plaintiff creditor additional security for the indebtedness of Williams ( W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Overstreet, supra). This court in that decision also ruled that the trial court erred in the rejection of certain evidence as to the correctness of the account sued on. On that trial the plaintiff had stricken Forbes as a defendant from the petition and also struck the second contract, and had proceeded against Overstreet and Davis, the administrator, for the liability above mentioned which arose under the first contract.</div><div class="casepar">At the second trial of this case the court rendered judgment for the defendants, and the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for new trial. In the third trial of the case ( Overstreet v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., <span class="casemissing">75 Ga. App. 483</span>) in September, 1946, before a jury, the defendants set up by amendment that by reason of a written notice to sue Williams, a resident of Chatham County, Georgia, and the failure of the plaintiff to do so within three months, they were released from liability on the contract sued on, and the trial judge sustained the demurrer of the plaintiff creditor to this amendment and struck the same. To this judgment the defendants excepted. On this trial evidence was introduced by testimony of Williams to the effect that the plaintiff's agent had taken up from him, according to the contract, $500 worth of unsold merchandise and no credit had been given on the indebtedness for this merchandise. The court disallowed this amendment and the defendants excepted. The defendants offered another amendment and set up that from the goods on hand and taken up by the plaintiff and from accounts turned over by Williams to the plaintiff there had been more than enough to pay the account sued on, for which no credit had been given. The court disallowed this amendment, and the defendant excepted. The trial court directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff for $764.30 principal and $838.18 interest. Upon exception to this court, it was held that the trial court erred in sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendants' amendment claiming release from liability and erred in refusing the defendants' proposed evidence in support of this amendment. The court also ruled that it was not error to strike the second amendment. The trial court was reversed. Overstreet v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., supra.</div><div class="casepar">The case came on for trial again in the instant proceedings, before the court sitting as a judge and jury. On October 11, 1950, the court rendered this judgment: "The court finds that the plea of release set up by the defendants has been sustained by the evidence. Therefore, judgment is rendered in favor of the defendants, who were sureties in the above stated matter. They are discharged from any liability in said case." On October 16, 1950, the court added this amendment to the judgment: "In order to allow an immediate appeal, the case is hereby dismissed as to the defendant sureties." The plaintiff contends that the judgment releasing the defendant sureties was error and that a finding in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants was demanded under the evidence and the law for the full amount claimed.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The defendants moved to dismiss the bill of exceptions in this court. Under the facts of this case, we may concede that the bill of exceptions is not subject to dismissal for the reasons assigned, since the whole matter was still within the breast of the court, passing upon the law and facts without the intervention of a jury. The plaintiff is complaining of the finding by the court in favor of the defendants that they are not liable, having been released by the failure of the plaintiff to sue. This contention is determined against the plaintiff. The bill of exceptions is not dismissed because there was no sufficient assignment of error to enable this court to pass upon the merits of the case. This is so, it is contended by the defendants, because the evidence being referred to in the bill of exceptions, being documents, depositions and oral testimony, is not made a part of the bill of exceptions. In the view which we take of this case, this is not material.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence authorized a finding by the court, as judge and jury, in favor of the defendants. The court was, by consent, sitting as both judge and jury, and as the court's finding is based upon evidence, legally before it, it cannot be said that the same was error as a matter of law. The evidence did not demand a finding in favor of the plaintiff of the full amount for which suit was brought. This court did not hold in W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Overstreet, <span class="casemissing">71 Ga. App. 783</span> (supra), that the evidence demanded a finding in favor of the plaintiff creditor, but this court simply ruled that the evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury for their determination. The burden was on the plaintiff to prove the account sued on, and while the evidence authorized a finding in favor of the account, it did not demand the same.</div><div class="casepar">The suit sought to be served on Williams by the plaintiff in Chatham County was brought against Williams as principal and Cato and Forbes as sureties, and was brought on the second (1931) contract. The present defendants were not parties thereto nor to the contract on which the suit was based. The defendants were not liable on this contract. Such a suit was not sufficient as meeting the requirements of said Code  103-205. A suit by the plaintiff against Williams and Forbes on the second contract was not adequate, under the provisions of said Code section, where the liability of the defendants was predicated on the first contract between the plaintiff and Williams, the one on which these defendants were the sureties. The fact that the sureties in the second contract agreed therein to be liable for all past indebtedness of Williams to the plaintiff company does not alter the above rule. What we hold is, that a suit by the plaintiff against the principal debtor on an obligation for which these defendants were not liable will not suffice under this Code section. It will be noted that the Code section refers to the obligation on which the sureties sought to be held liable became obligated to pay the creditor.</div><div class="casepar">The suit against Williams and these defendants on the first contract, wherein Williams was alleged to be a resident of Richmond County, this State, which suit the defendants failed to pursue against Williams, and it appearing that Williams was never served therein, not being in that county, will not operate as adequate to be a compliance with the provisions of Code  103-205, or to relieve the plaintiff of the necessity of compliance therewith. Such a holding would be manifestly unfair to a surety. He is entitled under the law to have the creditor sue the principal debtor, if he can be found. See McCarter v. Turner, <span class="casemissing">49 Ga. 309</span>, 312. Such was the purpose of the General Assembly in the enactment of the above Code section.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence sustained the plea of the defendants, by way of the amendment held by this court in Overstreet v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., supra, to have been proper, as to their being released from liability under the provisions of said Code  103-205. No suit of any kind was ever served upon the principal debtor, Williams. The suit attempted to be served in Chatham County on Williams was not on the contract on which it is sought to hold these defendants, but was on the 1931 contract between the plaintiff company and Williams and on which Cato and Forbes were the sureties. The first suit mentioned above does not slow a previous proper suit against the principal debtor and thus relieve the plaintiff from having to file a suit within three months when served with tile written notice as provided for in Code  103-205, and the second suit was not on the obligation now involved. The fact that in such obligation the sureties therein also undertook to be liable for all past indebtedness of Williams, which would embrace his indebtedness under the 1930 contract, does not alter the rule. These defendants were not liable under the 1931 contract and were not parties to that instrument. Any liabilities between the sureties on that contract and the plaintiff company are not for determination.</div><div class="casepar">It can not be said that because the sureties did not traverse the return of the deputy on the suit on this second contract, sought to be served on Williams in Chatham County, staging that Williams was not to be found by that officer in his "bailiwick," they became bound by this return and this made that suit a compliance with the request to sue made by these defendants to the plaintiff creditor, even if that suit which was on the second contract was otherwise sufficient for that purpose. These sureties were not parties to that suit. In this regard see Parler v. Johnson, <span class="casemissing">81 Ga. 254</span>, 259 (7 S. E. 317). There is no law that one not a party to an action is required to traverse the entry of service or non-service of the officer therein or become precluded thereby.</div><div class="casepar">There is nothing in the case of Watkins v. Seawright, <span class="casemissing">168 Ga. 750</span> (149 S. E. 45), and other decisions cited and relied on by the plaintiff which holds to the contrary of our views of this case. We have carefully considered all authorities cited in the briefs of the plaintiff and find nothing to the contrary of our ruling here.</div><div class="casepar">The judgment complained of was not erroneous for any of the reasons assigned, and being supported by the evidence and correct under the law, was properly rendered by the judge, sitting as a judge and jury.</div><div class="casepar">Since the trial court, passing upon the law and facts, without a jury, correctly found that the defendants in the instant case, Overstreet and Davis, were released as sureties, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the facts as to whether the indebtedness of Williams, as principal to the plaintiff's contracts, has or has not been paid.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
