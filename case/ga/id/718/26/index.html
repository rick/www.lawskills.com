In a suit on open account, where the plaintiff, a garageman, alleged that he made certain repairs and furnished certain parts in working upon certain motor vehicles brought to the garage by the defendant, to which action the defendant filed only a general denial, and where there was evidence to the effect that the plaintiff had made the repairs and furnished the parts as alleged, and no error of law appears, the court properly overruled the defendant's motion for a new trial on the general grounds.</div><div class="casepar">2. Where the charge of the court as a whole substantially covers the issues made by the pleadings, the defendant cannot complain that the court failed to instruct the jury as to a defense not pleaded, although such defense is supported by the evidence there being no request for the court so to charge.</div><div class="casepar">3. Where the defendant, in a suit on open account, filed a plea of general issue only, it was not error to fail to charge on a defense unauthorized by the pleadings although supported by the defendant's evidence.</div><div class="casepar">(a) It is the duty of the trial judge, even though not requested, to charge with sufficient fullness and clarity, and fairly to the plaintiff and to the defendant, as to the material contentions of the parties, and, in so doing, no essential contention of either party should be omitted. However, where in a suit on open account, the defendant has entered merely a general denial, the judge is not required, in stating the substance of the petition and answer, to elaborate the specific contentions of the defendant with reference to the evidence, if elsewhere in the charge the jury are fairly instructed as to the questions upon which they are to pass, as presented by the pleadings and supported by the evidence, and if there has been no proper written request for such a specific charge.</div><div class="casepar">4. In a suit on open account brought by the plaintiff, a garageman,against the defendant for repairing the automobiles of the defendant, to which suit the defendant filed only a general denial, the court did not err in charging the jury as follows: "If . . . you should determine that this defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff, as contended by him in this case--if you should believe that the work and parts and labor which the plaintiff . . . sets forth . . . as the basis of his account, were not furnished to him--that he is not indebted to the plaintiff in any sum, then the form of your verdict would be, 'We, the jury, find in favor of the defendant,' " although, under the evidence, the defendant, as to part of the account sued on, claimed that the plaintiff did not repair his truck in the manner specifically agreed upon, and that the repairs, as made by the plaintiff, and sued for in the present action, were unauthorized by him, and that he did not owe the plaintiff therefor.</div><div class="casepar">Sam Duggan, trading as Sam Duggan, the "Chevrolet Dealer," on September 22, 1949, brought suit against W. H. Lewis in the City Court of Sylvester; alleging that the defendant was indebted to him on open account in the sum of $751.85 principal and $110.06 interest, as per the itemized account attached to the petition, which the defendant failed and refused to pay. The attached exhibit showed that, beginning in January, 1947, the plaintiff had charged to the account of the defendant for certain repair work and parts on an automobile (1938 Chevrolet, and a 1935 or 1936 Chevrolet 1 1/2-ton truck, and a 1941 or 1942 Chevrolet truck 1 1/2-ton), the last item being repairs on a 1941 Chevrolet 1 1/2-ton truck on August 8, 1947, consisting of labor and parts. The defendant denied owing the account sued on. The case proceeded to trial before a jury and, after the introduction of evidence by the parties and the court's charge, the jury on March 20, 1951, returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $600. The defendant moved for a new trial on the general grounds, and by amendment added three special grounds, which will be dealt with in our opinion. The trial court overruled the defendant's motion for a new trial as amended, and he excepts.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. It is insisted by the defendant that the verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $600 "is not sustained by the evidence." The plaintiff is an automobile dealer handling Chevrolet motor vehicles in the City of Moultrie, near Sylvester, and operating also an automobile-repair business. It appeared that the defendant brought certain Chevrolets, one car and at least two trucks, into this repair shop and garage where the same were serviced, worked upon, and repaired, the present suit being for such repair work, labor, and parts used in the repair of these vehicles. The defendant testified: that the plaintiff had repaired a 1942 truck for him and also worked upon other vehicles; that this truck belonged to his oldest son, but that he took it to the plaintiff's place of business and instructed some employee of the plaintiff, whose name he did not give, to install a new motor therein, to replace the transmission with a new one, and also to install a new ring gear and pinion; that he was informed that these would cost around $344; that he went to the plaintiff's garage the first of October, 1947, at which time he paid the plaintiff for other work already done, $100.05, and also took this truck out without paying for the work on it, and that it would not operate properly, leaking oil, and he so informed the plaintiff's employees and showed the truck to them, and was told to bring it back, and upon doing so, found them busy, and he "didn't carry it back no more"; that the truck was not worth the amount of the repair bill; that, when he got this truck, he inquired as to what he then owed the plaintiff and was informed that he owed $100.05 in addition to owing for the work on this truck, and he paid the older bill; that he never heard about "any claim on the part of Sam Duggan or any of his force about . . . owing them a bill on a 1941 truck or a 1938 car or a 1936 truck"; "that, while some work was done by the plaintiff on the 1938 car, which was the only car the defendant had, none was done in 1947; that it was not true, as the plaintiff's witness said, that he brought this car into the defendant's garage on June 7, 1947, and certain work was done"; that this work was not done, "unless they came out to my home and worked on the car there"; that he remembered buying a transmission for $74.25, carrying it home and same was installed in a truck by his son; that he never owned a 1935 truck, but did own a 1936 truck, and the work for which the plaintiff charged him on the truck, if this was meant for the 1936 truck, amounted to $122.65, and was done, not by the plaintiff, but by Cecil Jennings at Sylvester; that he signed the bills dated February 4, 1947, and January 30, 1947, but the signature on the one of March 14, 1947, was not his, and he did not sign any bills for work in April or in June of 1947; that he owes the plaintiff only for the ring gear and pinion and for "bushing up the 1942 truck"; and that the repair order of June 7, 1947, was signed by "W. H. Lewis," but he did not know how his signature got there, and his 1938 Chevrolet was in his yard on that date. There was testimony of witnesses for the defendant that he had a wreck with the 1938 Chevrolet in February, 1947, and thereafter this car remained at the defendant's home, particularly in February and March, 1947, and at times was seen sitting there for around a year afterwards. One witness stated that it was not driven until around a year after the wreck in February, 1947. Another testified that he could not swear that the car was never moved, but that he saw the</div><div class="casepar">same there "all during the summer, and it was not in running condition." The plaintiff's evidence, mainly consisting of his testimony and that of the employees at the garage, and of his books and records tended to show that he had done the repair work and furnished the parts as claimed and sued for, and that the defendant was indebted to him therefor.</div><div class="casepar">There is no merit in the defendant's contention that a finding was demanded in his favor that the (1941) 1942 truck had not been repaired as agreed and, therefore, the amount of around $620 (619.20) sued for as to this item was not due. It was the defendant's contention that the plaintiff had agreed to install in this track a new motor, transmission, etc., which he did not do, but undertook to work over and repair the old motor. The jury found this issue against the defendant, and such finding was supported by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">It appears from the evidence that the defendant, while denying in his answer that he was indebted to the plaintiff, admitted facts authorizing the jury to find that the plaintiff did the repair work claimed, and that the defendant was due him therefor the amount of the verdict, $600.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the general grounds of the motion for a new trial are not meritorious. The verdict in favor of the plaintiff was supported by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant testified that he took the truck to the plaintiff's garage and stated that he desired to have installed therein a new motor, transmission, etc., after ascertaining that this would cost around $344, which the plaintiff's employees agreed to do, which the plaintiff had failed to do. However, the evidence for the plaintiff showed the work done and parts furnished by the plaintiff on this truck and on the 1938 car and 1936 (1935) truck as sued for.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant in his answer made a general denial. He did not plead that there was any such agreement with the plaintiff, which the plaintiff failed to carry out, and that, therefore, he did not owe the plaintiff for any work done on the truck, the same amounting to $619.20. The defendant cannot complain that the trial judge did not submit to the jury a defense which he did not plead. See Cowan v. Bank of Baconton, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 645</span> (94 S. E. 808); American Ins. Co. v. Bailey &amp; Musgrove, <span class="casemissing">6 Ga. App. 424 (6)</span> (65 S. E. 160); Chattahoochee Valley Ry. Co. v. Bass, <span class="casemissing">9 Ga. App. 83 (14)</span> (70 S. E. 683). The charge of the court substantially covered the issues made by the pleadings and the evidence. No written request was properly made by the defendant for a fuller and more specific charge or for instructions to the jury on the defense that the plaintiff had failed to perform the agreement made with him to install a new motor, transmission, ring gear and pinion in this truck. See Mendenhall v. Nalley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../725/29/index.html">81 Ga. App. 517</a></span>, 521 (2) (59 S. E. 2d, 283). In these circumstances, no error appears from this special ground.</div><div class="casepar">3. In special ground 2 the defendant says a new trial should be granted for the reason that the charge of the court, taken as a whole, consisted of abstract principles of law, and the jury were not informed as to what the issues were, and the charge was not adjusted to the issues raised by the pleadings and the evidence, and there was no application of the principles of law to such issues, so that the jury would be able to understand what to decide. This special ground is without merit. The charge, as a whole, covered the case as made by the pleadings and the evidence. The court said that the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was indebted in the sum sued for on open account, and that the defendant denied owing such account, and that "this . . . forms the issue . . . that has been submitted for your consideration and determination, and to be determined by you in the light of the evidence . . . if . . . you should determine that this defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff, as contended by him . . . if you should believe that the work and parts and labor, which the plaintiff . . . sets forth . . . as basis of his account, were not furnished to him--that he is not indebted to the plaintiff in any sum"--a verdict should be for the defendant; "but . . . if you should find from the evidence that there is some indebtedness due the plaintiff by the defendant and not the full amount sued for," a verdict for such amount should be rendered. The court then stated that "the full contentions of the parties are set forth in the pleadings."</div><div class="casepar">There was no request for a fuller charge as to the contentions of the parties, and the charge given was not error. Instructions to the jury are properly confined to the issues raised by the pleadings, and it is not error to fail to give a charge which is not authorized by the pleadings. Martin v Nichols, <span class="casemissing">127 Ga. 705</span> (56 S. E. 995); Hewitt v. Lamb, <span class="casemissing">130 Ga. 709</span> (61 S. E. 716). "Where a defendant has entered merely a general denial of the allegations of the petition, it is not required that the judge in stating the substance of the pleadings, shall further elaborate the specific contentions with reference to the evidence, if elsewhere in the charge the jury are fairly instructed as to the questions upon which they are to pass, and if there has been no proper written request for such a specific charge." American Surety Co. v. Smith, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 633 (2)</span> (191 S. E. 137). So, where an issue is raised solely by the evidence and not under the pleadings, and there is no proper request to charge thereon, then a failure by the court to charge on such contention is not erroneous. See McLean v. Mann, <span class="casemissing">148 Ga. 114</span> (95 S. E. 985); City of Brunswick v. Glogauer, <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 792</span>, 816 (124 S. E. 787), and cases cited.</div><div class="casepar">4. There is no merit in special ground 3, in which error is assigned on this charge: "If . . . you should determine that this defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff, as contended by him in this case--if you should believe that the work and parts and labor which the plaintiff . . . sets forth . . . as the basis of his account, were not furnished to him--that he is not indebted to the plaintiff in any sum, then the form of your verdict would be, 'We, the jury, find in favor of the defendant.'" Besides, under the ruling in division 1 hereof, we have seen that this charge was correct and applicable.</div><div class="casepar">5. The evidence authorized the verdict, and none of the special grounds of the defendant's motion for new trial shows any error. The motion for a new trial was properly denied.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
