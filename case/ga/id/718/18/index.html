That the trial judge was on a previous occasion the attorney for the defendant in another criminal action will not disqualify him from presiding in a trial for a different offense of the same nature, committed at a different time and requiring different evidence.</div><div class="casepar">2. The conduct of the defendant subsequent to the return of the indictment, in a criminal offense, is generally not relevant on a trial of the offense charged.</div><div class="casepar">3. The rejection of the documentary evidence here is not a ground for a new trial, the witness having testified fully without objection as to its contents, since such evidence was admissible to throw light on whether or not the abandonment, if any, was wilful and voluntary.</div><div class="casepar">4. The offense of abandonment in Code  74-9902 contemplates the wilful and voluntary abandonment by a father of his minor child, and intention is an essential element of the offense. It was accordingly error to reject evidence offered by the defendant that he had paid for the child's support weekly sums in excess of an amount ordered by the court and made a part of the sentence on a previous abandonment charge more than two years before the return of the indictment in this case.</div><div class="casepar">5. The excerpt from the charge complained of was erroneous, in that it withdrew from the consideration of the jury the defense that any failure to furnish the minor child with sufficient sums for its food and clothing was not wilful or with intention of abandoning the child.</div><div class="casepar">6. The 9th special ground is treated as abandoned, and the general grounds of the motion for a new trial are not here passed upon, as the case is to be tried again.</div><div class="casepar">Abandonment; from Cherokee Superior Court -- Judge Brooke. December 31, 1951.</div><div class="casepar">On December 7, 1948, J. C. Cox was indicted in the Superior Court of Cherokee County for the abandonment of a minor child. On April 10, 1951, the defendant was arrested under a bench warrant based thereon, there having been no previous attempt at service. On the trial of the case the testimony of the prosecutrix, the mother of the minor, was to the effect that the defendant sent her $3 on some weeks, $5 on others, and for periods of time none at all, and that these sums were insufficient to furnish clothing and food for the needs of the child. The clerk of the superior court testified that, prior to May 1, 1948, the defendant had been forwarding to him for transmittal to the prosecutrix sums of approximately $5 per week, but had been somewhat behind with his payments; that on May 1, 1948, he paid his arrearage in full; and that he then sent approximately $5 per week, or a total of $110, between May 1 and December 7, 1948. The defendant made a statement, in which he said: that in 1936 he was before this court on the charge of abandonment of the same minor child; that the court ordered him to pay $3 per week toward her support; that he had in fact paid $5 per week thereafter through the registry of the court; that his daughter was now over 18 years of age and self-supporting, for which reason he felt that he should no longer make payments toward her support; that he had been aware that the indictment now being tried was extant and had been advised that it would not be served so long as he kept up these payments; and that he thereafter ceased sending payments, whereupon the warrant was served for his arrest.</div><div class="casepar">The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The defendant filed a motion for new trial, which was amended by adding 10 special grounds, and the overruling of this motion is assigned as error.</div><div class="casepar"> (After stating the foregoing facts.) 1. Special ground 1 of the amended motion for a new trial assigns error on the judge's refusal to disqualify himself on the ground that he had been a practicing attorney representing the defendant in the previous abandonment case in 1933 regarding the same child. The only provision of Code  24-102 with which we are concerned here provides that no judge shall preside, act or serve in any case "in which he has been of counsel." The provisions of this Code section are exhaustive, and a judge will not be disqualified unless he falls under one of the prohibitions therein contained. Moore v. Dugas, <span class="casemissing">166 Ga. 493</span> (143 S. E. 591); Long v. State, <span class="casemissing">25 Ga. App. 22</span> (102 S. E. 359). Where, as an attorney, the judge handled the same transaction which is the subject matter of the litigation, he will be disqualified. Murray County v. Pickering, <span class="casemissing">195 Ga. 182</span> (23 S. E. 2d, 436). But a case where the judge "has been of counsel" means the particular case being tried, and the fact that he has represented the party in another case will not disqualify him. Duncan v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 223 Fed. 446. The trials of the defendant for two abandonments, one in 1933 and the other in 1948, involve separate crimes and entirely different evidence, and therefore do not involve the same transaction. The motion was very properly overruled by the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special grounds 5 and 6 complain of the court's refusal to allow certain evidence concerning payments of $5 per week toward the support of the minor child, made after the grand jury had returned the indictment in December, 1948. If the facts stated by the defendant are true, this evidence would not only have shown payments made for a part of the time between the return of the indictment and the date of trial, but would also have shown that no payments whatever were made during another part of this time. Obviously, proof of criminal acts after the return of the indictment could form no basis for conviction, as they are not relevant to the offense charged. For the same reason, proof that the defendant had supported the child to some extent after the indictment was sued out would not be relevant to prove his innocence of the crime charged. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow this evidence.</div><div class="casepar">4. Error is assigned in special ground 2 on the rejection of the original sentence imposed in the 1936 abandonment case; in special ground 3 on the rejection of the sentence as contained in the official minute book of the court; and in special grounds 7 and 8 on the court's statement in refusing this evidence, that "the whole question here is whether or not he has paid a sufficient amount of money for the support of the child within the two years prior to December 7, 1948."</div><div class="casepar">It should be observed that the entire defense was based on the theory that there had been no abandonment because the defendant had, from 1936 to the date of the indictment on which this case was tried, paid for the child's support sums of at least the amount which the court had required him to pay; that the amount necessary for the child's support had been determined in 1936 and had never been changed, and that, when he had paid the amount which the court adjudged necessary for support, he could not be said to have "wilfully and voluntarily" abandoned his child. This contention is based upon the following provision in the sentence of the court: "This sentence is suspended so long as the defendant pays $3.00 per week for the support of his child to the clerk of court." The question is therefore whether or not compliance with this provision of the sentence on the part of the defendant would provide a defense against the charge of abandonment; it being admitted that $3 per week would probably not, as a matter of fact, have been sufficient in 1948 to "furnish sufficient food and clothing for the needs of the child," as contemplated by Code  74-9902. Similar questions have arisen in abandonment proceedings where there had been a prior alimony decree setting an amount which the defendant should pay for the support of a named child; and the courts have indicated that compliance with such decree might be a sufficient defense, although under the facts of those cases the defense was not established because the defendant had in fact failed to pay the amounts due under the alimony decree. King v. State, <span class="casemissing">12 Ga. App. 482</span> (77 S. E. 651); Ozburn v. State, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 823</span> (54 S. E. 2d, 376). And in McComas v. Glendinning, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. App. 234</span>, 236 (200 S. E. 304), it was held: "Refusal to provide a child with the necessities of life is only one element in the act of abandoning a child. In this case it appears from the petition that the father did not desert his son, but that the care, custody and control of the son were taken from him by a decree of court. Under the Georgia law such a decree would preclude a prosecution for abandonment in the absence of an actual abandonment, and the mother and son would be relegated to their remedies under the decree for the reason that there is no voluntary action when the law takes jurisdiction and fixes the status of the parties." However, the sentence or decree under which the law fixes the status of the parties must be a valid decree, for no rights or liabilities accrue to either party by reason of an order which is absolutely void. The sentence in the present case was a suspended sentence, conditioned to "begin and be counted from the time of the reception of said defendant in the chaingang under this order and judgment. This sentence is suspended so long as the defendant pays $3.00 per week for the support of his child to clerk of court." As the defendant was never received into the chaingang, his term of sentence was never begun. A suspension provision in a sentence--such as this--was, prior to the act of 1933 (Code,  27-2706), void. As stated in Neal v. State, <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 509</span>, 515 (30 S. E. 858), "Such words in such a sentence are of no legal force, and consequently should be ignored and the sentence executed just as if they did not appear therein." By the act of 1941 (Code, Ann. Supp.,  27-2707) suspended sentences of this sort were made legal in abandonment and bastardy cases; but this law is not retroactive and does not have the effect of legalizing such provision in a sentence entered before 1941. Clarke v. Carlan, <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 130</span> (26 S. E. 2d, 362). It cannot therefore be held as a matter of law that compliance by the defendant with the terms of the 1936 sentence--the portion of which relating to its suspension upon payment of $3 per week being a void proviso--would necessarily be a defense to the present prosecution.</div><div class="casepar">State, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 221</span> (172 S. E. 670). As stated in Brock v. State, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 414</span>, 418 (180 S. E. 644): "Intention is peculiarly a part of the offense of abandonment." See also Phelps v. State, <span class="casemissing">10 Ga. App. 41</span> (72 S. E. 524), holding that intention is essentially a part of every crime, and particularly that of abandonment. There is no crime, under the terms of the Code section, unless the abandonment is "wilful and voluntary." Under these circumstances, the defendant was entitled to introduce the former sentence and his compliance therewith to throw light on the question of whether or not his abandonment, if any, of his minor child was wilful and voluntary, this being a question for the jury to determine after a consideration of all the evidence relating to the question.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
