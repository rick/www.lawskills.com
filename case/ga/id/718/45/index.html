J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The petition of the defendant in the trial court for the writ of certiorari to the City Court of Decatur fails to show any error. The Judge of the Superior Court of DeKalb County properly overruled and denied the certiorari, affirming the judgment of the City Court of Decatur, and providing that the plaintiff in the suit in the City Court of Decatur, same being an action on a judgment against the defendant obtained in the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, recover of the said defendant $7015.54 principal, $491.09 interest, and costs.</div><div class="casepar">Hugh W. Caffey filed in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, a petition for certiorari from which the following facts appear: On December 28, 1950, suit was filed in the City Court of Decatur against said Caffey by "General Electric Supply Corporation," it being alleged that Caffey was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $7015.54, with legal interest, from May 2, 1950, on a certain judgment which it had obtained at the April term, 1950, of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, which judgment has not been satisfied. Attached to the petition as Exhibit A, was a copy of the suit in the Harrison County Circuit Court by the said electric corporation against Caffey, which appeared as suit No. 11035, filed to the April term, 1947, of said court, being a suit on a note, executed by the Electric Service Company of Pensacola by Hugh W. Caffey, President, on January 28, 1944, in favor of said General Electric Supply Corporation, New Orleans, La. It was alleged that Caffey was doing business under the firm name of Electric Service Company. The defendant was served personally with a copy of the suit on the note in Mississippi. There is attached, as a part of Exhibit A to the suit in the City Court of Decatur, a copy of a judgment numbered 11220, in favor of General Electric Credit Corporation and against said Hugh W. Caffey, "at April 1950 term" of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, "recorded in Minute Book 23, page 223, rendered May 2, 1950," for $7015.54, principal.</div><div class="casepar">The exemplification certificate of the clerk of the Mississippi court recites that same is a true and correct copy of the papers of record in the case of General Electric Supply Corporation v. Hugh W. Caffey, No. 11035, and recites that judgment was rendered May 2, 1949, as appears from Minute Book 23, page 223, on a declaration filed February 25, 1947.</div><div class="casepar">No answer or demurrer was interposed by the defendant Caffey to the suit in the City Court of Decatur. The only pleading filed by Caffey is what he styles a traverse to the return by the sheriff of the service upon him of the suit in said city court. This return recites: "I have this day served the defendant Hugh W. Caffey by leaving a copy of the within writ and process at his most notorious place of abode in this State." The paper styled by Caffey as a "Traverse of Service" recites as follows: "Comes Hugh W. Caffey . . . and specially appearing before any other defensive pleadings in this case, and shows that the return of service in this case is incorrect and in error, and that he was not a resident of DeKalb County, Georgia on December 29, 1950, or when this suit was filed and had no place of abode in said county and could not be served notoriously anywhere in said county on December 25, 1950. Wherefore, said Hugh W. Caffey puts himself upon the country in the premises and prays that the Sheriff of DeKalb County, and G. C. Josey, the deputy sheriff who made said return of service each be served with a copy of this traverse and made party to this traverse, and prays judgment of the court adjudging that said return of service is false and that no service has been had upon him in this case." This pleading was verified by Caffey. It was filed May 19, 1951. The process in the suit on the judgment required the defendant to appear on flee third Monday in March, 1951.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff corporation interposed its demurrer to the foregoing pleading styled a traverse. The fourth ground of this demurrer sets up: that "Plaintiff demurs generally to the so-called traverse of service, and moves that it be stricken on the ground that although it contains some of the elements required of a plea to the jurisdiction that said pleading is defective in that plaintiff is not afforded a better writ therein by reason of the fact that the defendant fails to show in what county he re sides and what courts have jurisdiction of his person and the subject matter of this suit." The trial court sustained said paragraph 4 of the plaintiff's demurrer as follows: "The within and foregoing demurrers of the plaintiff to the defendant's traverse of service coming on regularly to be heard after argument by counsel for both parties it is ordered, considered and adjudged that the same be and hereby are sustained on the ground No. four (4) thereof. All other grounds reserved. The defendant shall have ten (10) days within which to amend to meet said demurrers. Otherwise the traverse of service stands dismissed. This May 15, 1951."</div><div class="casepar">There was no exception to the foregoing ruling and order. On May 25, 1951, the defendant obtained an order extending the time to amend to May 31, 1951. Thereafter, on May 31, 1951, Caffey amended this traverse by striking therefrom these allegations "and that he was not a resident of DeKalb County, Georgia, on December 28, 1950, or when this suit was filed, and had no place of abode in said county and could not be served notoriously anywhere in said county on December 28, 1950," and in lieu thereof alleged: "Because this defendant was not on or at any time during December 28,1950, residing at 248 Seneca Avenue, Decatur, DeKalb County, Georgia, at which place the copy of the writ and process in this case was left on said date to effect the notorious service alleged in said return of service, and that therefore the leaving of said copy did not effect service upon this defendant; and that no copy of said writ or process has been left at a usual place of abode of this defendant, and that said 248 Seneca Avenue was not at all a place of abode of this defendant when the copy of writ and process was left there as aforesaid." Thereafter, on July 2, 1951, the trial judge rendered this judgment: "Whereas, the plaintiff has previously filed demurrers to defendant's traverse of service, and whereas, after hearing thereon, ground No. 4 of plaintiff's said demurrers was sustained with leave to defendant to amend; and whereas, defendant thereafter filed an amendment to his traverse of service, subject to objection, which amendment is not responsive to plaintiff's said ground of demurrer and which said amendment does not correct the defect in defendant's traverse of service pointed out by said ground No. 4 of plaintiff's demurrer. Now, therefore, it is ordered, considered, and adjudged that defendant's said traverse of service stands dismissed, pursuant to order of court dated May 15, 1951. It appearing that plaintiff's claim is based upon an unconditional contract of record, that is, a judgment rendered in the circuit court of Harrison County, Mississippi, which judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, a judgment by default is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff, General Electric Supply Corporation, and against the defendant, Hugh W. Caffey, in the sum of $7015.54 principal, $491.09 interest to date of judgment, and all costs of this court." The petition for certiorari assigns error on the foregoing as being contrary to law.</div><div class="casepar">The petition for writ of certiorari was sanctioned by a Judge of DeKalb Superior Court, on July 3, 1951, and on the same day a writ of certiorari was issued and directed to the trial judge. Said Judge of the City Court of Decatur, in answering the petition for certiorari, "adopts the within petition for certiorari as filed in DeKalb Superior Court, as true and correct for his answer in said cause; together with the motion to 'amend misnomer' as allowed by me dated July 20,1951, and as filed of same date in the clerk's office of the Superior Court of DeKalb County. This July 23, 1951."</div><div class="casepar">Under date of July 20,1951, General Electric Credit Corporation filed an amendment setting up that the true name of the plaintiff in the suit on the judgment and in the action in Mississippi in which the judgment was obtained is General Electric Credit Corporation and not General Electric Supply Corporation, and that through misadventure it had been referred to as General Electric Supply Corporation, which was a misnomer. This amendment was properly verified and was allowed by the judge of the trial court instanter and the pleadings in said case ordered amended by the judge of said city court on said date.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant, Caffey, demurred to and moved to strike from the judge's answer to the certiorari the words, "together with the motion to 'amend misnomer' as allowed by me dated July 20, 1951, and as filed of same date in clerk's office Superior Court of DeKalb County," upon the ground that no such motion appears in the record and no allowance of any such motion appears and no motion to amend misnomer could be allowed by the judge of said city court and no basis or ground of authority for the judge to allow such a motion appears, and because it appears that the date of the allowance is after the date of the final judgment in the case in said city court in regard to which the certiorari issued, and upon the ground that no such motion and no such allowance have been filed and the same could not be legally filed and any such motion and allowance thereof would be irrelevant, immaterial, and impertinent in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The Judge of the Superior Court of DeKalb County, before whom said certiorari application was heard, overruled the above motion of the defendant Caffey as to the answer of the trial judge to the petition for certiorari on September 12, 1951, and thereafter on October 15, 1951, said superior court judge overruled the petition for certiorari and affirmed the judgment of the City Court of Decatur and rendered judgment that the defendant in certiorari recover of the petitioner for certiorari, Hugh W. Caffey, $7015.54 principal, $491.09 interest, and costs.</div><div class="casepar">The bill of exceptions assigns error on the judgment overruling the petition for certiorari and on the order overruling the demurrer and motion to strike a part of the answer of the city court judge to said certiorari.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. It is earnestly insisted that the Superior Court of DeKalb County erred in overruling the petition for certiorari. The plaintiff corporation on December 28, 1950, filed its petition in the City Court of Decatur against Caffey on a judgment of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, for $7015.54 principal, $491.09 interest, and costs. The entry of the service of the suit in the City Court of Decatur recited that the defendant was served at his most notorious place of abode. The defendant Caffey did not file any plea or answer or any demurrer. The only pleading filed by the defendant is what he denominates a traverse of the return of service, in which he sets up that, at the time the suit on the judgment was filed, he had no place of abode in DeKalb County, was not a resident of that county, and could not be served notoriously anywhere in that county on December 28, 1950. The plaintiff demurred generally to this plea of traverse and moved to strike the same. Paragraph 4 of this demurrer was that, although said traverse contains some of the elements required of a plea to the jurisdiction, the same is defective in that the defendant fails to show in what county he resides and what courts have jurisdiction of his person and the subject matter of this suit. The court sustained this ground of the plaintiff's demurrer and gave to the defendant ten days in which to amend and meet the defect pointed out in this ground of the demurrer, otherwise "the traverse of service stands dismissed." The defendant acquiesced in this ruling in that he thereafter obtained an extension of time in which to file said amendment, and instead of excepting to such ruling, he filed on May 31, 1951, an amendment to his traverse, in which he struck certain allegations and added others in lieu thereof, but did not allege what court or courts in this State have jurisdiction of said case against him in said City Court of Decatur, and did not allege in what county he resided, and did not attempt to meet the defect therein as set out in the fourth ground of the plaintiff's demurrer to said traverse. The trial court thereupon ruled that said amendment was not responsive to and did not correct the defect pointed out by ground 4 of said demurrer, and that said "traverse of service stands dismissed pursuant to order of court dated May 15, 1951." The court then rendered judgment in the suit on the judgment in favor of the plaintiff therein, the case being in default. When the defendant Caffey did not except to the order sustaining the fourth ground of the plaintiff's demurrer to such traverse, such ruling and order became the law of the case and binding on the defendant. Code  81-502, dealing with pleas to the jurisdiction, provides that in all such pleas it must appear that there is a court in this State which has jurisdiction of the case. It has long been settled that an amendment by the pleader to meet a ruling on a demurrer to the pleading waives any right of such pleader to except to the ruling and order sustaining the demurrer. For instance, when a demurrer to a pleading is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff, if the pleading is the petition, may take the position that his peti-</div><div class="casepar">tion is good and except to the order sustaining the demurrer thereto, or he may acquiesce in the correctness of the ruling on the demurrer and amend to meet it. By amending to meet the demurrer, he agrees to the correctness of the ruling and cannot thereafter except to the ruling. It is immaterial whether the ruling on the demurrer was correct or not. See Walton v. Sikes, <span class="casemissing">165 Ga. 422 (5)</span> (141 S. E. 188); Baker v. Calloway, <span class="casemissing">167 Ga. 908</span> (147 S. E. 562); Norton v. Brown, <span class="casemissing">173 Ga. 146 (3)</span> (159 S. E. 702).</div><div class="casepar">The defendant Caffey was bound by the ruling sustaining the fourth ground of the plaintiff's demurrer to the traverse, and it became the the case that the defendant amend and show in what county and court. he could be sued (Code,  81-502), and when he failed to do this, the court properly struck the traverse and, no other pleading being interposed by the defendant, rendered final judgment in the plaintiff's favor on said Mississippi judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Misnomers can be corrected instantly by appropriate amendment. The difference in the corporate name of the judgment plaintiff, as appears in the copies of the Mississippi suit and judgment and the exemplification thereof, are obviously misnomers, and were cured by the amendment. No attack was made however, on this difference in the corporate name of the plaintiff suing in Mississippi and getting the judgment in that State, by the defendant in the City Court of Decatur, and he only calls attention thereto for the first time in the petition for certiorari. If there was a difference in the corporate names which rendered the proceedings improper in the City Court of Decatur, the appropriate attack should have been made thereon in that court.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that the superior court judge did not err in denying the defendant's petition for the writ of certiorari, and in rendering judgment in said case affirming the judgment of the City Court of Decatur, and in rendering judgment that the plaintiff (defendant in certiorari) recover of the defendant (petitioner in certiorari) on said Mississippi judgment in the amount sued for, being $7015.54 principal, $491.09 interest, and costs.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Woodruff, Swift &amp; Dorsey, contra.</div><div class="caselawyer">N.
