The exclusion of an ineligible nominee would not change the result of an election or cast doubt upon its outcome so that an election contest predicated an such exclusion could be maintained.</div><div class="casepar">2. The cross appeal was abandoned and will not be considered.</div><div class="casepar">Guy J. Tripp and Fred W. Giddens filed an election contest petition against Roy J. Holder, as Ordinary of Dodge County, and S. C. Cadwell. The petition sought to contest the results of the general election held in Dodge County an November 5 1968, and alleged that: the defendant Cadwell was certified and declared to be elected to the office of Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Dodge County, without opposition; that the defendant's election was void and invalid for the reason that the plaintiff Tripp was a Republican Party nominee for the office in question and had met all the requirements of the Georgia Election Code but that the defendant Holder had refused to place Tripp's name an the ballot; that since Tripp's name was omitted from the ballot, the defendant Holder erred in declaring the results for the office of Commissioner of Roads and Revenues; that the refusal of the defendant Holder to place Tripp's name on the ballot constituted an irregularity and misconduct sufficient to change or place in doubt the results of the election.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants answered, denying the material allegations of the petition and set out the following additional defenses: (a) that the Republican Party had failed to conduct a proper primary since the only polling place provided was at Lees Election District located in the Dodge County courthouse and no other polling places were provided in the other official 15 election districts of the county; (b) that the primary conducted by the Republican Party amounted to a secret primary and was therefore illegal; (c) that the plaintiff Tripp was a poll officer at the Democratic Primary held on September 11, 1968, at which the candidate was nominated for Commissioner of Roads and Revenues; (d) that there had been filed a petition for mandamus, decided adversely to the plaintiffs, which was between the same parties and privies and an the same grounds and subject matter as the instant suit; hence the plaintiffs were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</div><div class="casepar">The parties stipulated to the following facts: (1) the plaintiff Tripp filed notice of his candidacy as required by law and a certificate of nomination an his behalf was filed by the Republican Party with the Ordinary of Dodge County; (2) there are 16 election districts in Dodge County, including Lees Election District in which Dodge County courthouse is located; (3) the Republican Party had a polling place, poll officers and paper ballots furnished at the Lees Election District at the September 11, 1968, primary; (4) Tripp's name was placed on the paper ballots which were used only in the Lees Election District; (5) there were no Republican polling places in the other 15 election districts in Dodge County; (6) Tripp was unopposed in the Republican primary and received 11 votes; (7) Cadwell was the Democratic nominee at the primary on September 11, 1968; (8) the ordinary, the defendant Holder, entered an order reciting that the only polling place provided by the Republican Party was at Lees Election District and that there were no polling places provided in any of the other 15 election districts of Dodge County; (9) Tripp was a pall officer in the September 11, 1968, Democratic primary held in Dodge County and was also a Democratic committeeman; (10) the population of Dodge County is less than 40,000 persons.</div><div class="casepar">Based on the stipulations, pleadings and other documents, the trial judge entered an order finding: (1) that the Ordinary of Dodge County had the authority to determine whether the plaintiff Tripp was duly qualified to have his name placed on the ballot as a candidate; (2) there were sufficient irregularities in the Republican primary to find that no proper primary was conducted. The trial judge entered a judgment in favor of the defendants.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiffs appealed from that judgment and enumerated the same as error.</div><div class="casepar">1. The parties stipulated that in the primary at which defendant Cadwell was chosen as Democratic nominee for the office of Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of Dodge County, the plaintiff Tripp served as a poll officer. Code Ann.  34-503 (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., pp. 26, 43) provides: "No poll officer shall be eligible to any nomination or public office to be voted for at a primary or election at which he shall serve." In our view, this statute is controlling. Its language is broad and unequivocal in scope and purpose. The statute declares than one who serves as a poll officer is ineligible: (1) for a nomination to be voted for at either a primary or an election at which he shall serve; (2) for public office to be voted for at a primary or an election at which he shall serve. There is no indication that this provision was designed merely to prohibit one acting in such capacity from running in the particular primary in which he was involved. Instead the language compels us to the conclusion that the legislature intended that a poll officer be as Caesar's wife, above reproach or suspicion.</div><div class="casepar">While there are cases holding that an election will not be voided even though a poll officer was not qualified (see Ann., 1 ALR 1535, 1541; King v. Board of Education, <span class="casemissing">42 Ga. App. 563</span>, 570 (<span class="casemissing">156 SE 710</span>), affirmed by an equally divided court in King v. Board of Education, <span class="casemissing">174 Ga. 685 (164 SE 52)</span>), a different situation is presented here. This statute is not merely a prohibition relative to a candidate serving as a poll officer, but instead emphatically provides that a poll officer is ineligible to be a candidate. Thus, it deals imperatively with the qualifications of a candidate. While the plaintiff's acting as a poll officer might not invalidate the primary at which he served, it would disqualify him to hold the office which was voted for at the primary. Hence, the effect is not to void the election but to disqualify the prospective candidate.</div><div class="casepar">Code Ann.  34-103 (r) (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., pp. 26, 28) provides: "The words 'party nomination' shall mean the selection by a political party, in accordance with the provisions of this Code, of a candidate for a public office authorized to be voted for at an election." Regardless of whether the ordinary had authority to pass upon the plaintiff's qualifications (see Black v. Salter, Civil Action 2401, Middle District of Ga., now pending in the Fifth Circuit), it is apparent that the plaintiff was not qualified since he was ineligible to serve and there was no error harmful to him in excluding his name from the ballot.</div><div class="casepar">Under the applicable provision of the Election Code the result of a primal or election may be contested for "malconduct, fraud or irregularity by any primary or election official or officials sufficient to change or place in doubt the result." Code Ann.  34-1703 (a) (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., pp. 26, 178). It is evident that the exclusion of the ineligible nominee would not have changed the results of the contested election or cast doubt upon its outcome.</div><div class="casepar">2. The defendants expressly abandoned their cross appeal, complaining of the trial judge overruling their plea of res judicata, hence there will be no consideration of this issue.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment on main appeal affirmed; cross appeal dismissed. Felton, C. J., and Pannell, J., concur.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Smith &amp; Harrington, Wilton D.
