The penalty allowable under Code  5-706 is a part of the "amount involved" in actions in the Civil Court of Fulton County, and where the plaintiff sued for $297.5O as the amount allegedly due under the provisions of the insurance policy sued on, and for $73.38 as penalty, plus costs and attorney's fees, the "amount involved" exceeded $300 and the appeal of the case was properly made to this court rather than to the Appellate Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence demanded a finding that the applicant made a false representation in the application for insurance which was attached to the policy and that such misrepresentation was material to the risk involved; therefore, a verdict was demanded for the defendant, and the court erred in overruling the defendant's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Rilla W. Wilson sued General Assurance Corporation in the Civil Court of Fulton County for proceeds payable under a policy of insurance. The plaintiff applied for a policy of hospitalization and surgical-expense insurance and a policy was issued to her upon the payment of $42.50 in premiums, the policy becoming effective August 27, 1953. On September 15, 1953, the plaintiff was admitted to St. Joseph's Infirmary in Atlanta as a patient and was confined therein for a period of 32 days. On October 31, 1953, the plaintiff filed a claim with the defendant for $297.50 which she claimed was payable under the provisions of the policy. On November 18, 1953, the defendant refused payment of the claim and tendered to the plaintiff $42.50, representing the premium, and declared the policy null and void. The plaintiff refused the tender of the premium, and on February 15, 1954, instituted this action on the policy seeking $297.50 as the principal amount due, $73.38 penalty, $250 as attorney's fees and reasonable costs. The plaintiff died during the pendency of the action and her executor was made a party.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant answered alleging that the policy was void because of a material misrepresentation contained in the application which was attached to the policy.</div><div class="casepar">At the close of the evidence the court directed a verdict for the defendant on the items of penalty and attorney's fees. The record does not disclose the circumstances surrounding the direction of the verdict on these items. The defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the remaining issue was overruled. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $297.50. The defendant moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. These motions were overruled and the defendant excepts.</div><div class="casepar">1. The defendant in error moves for a dismissal of the writ of error on the ground that the amount involved in the action was less than $300, and that therefore the appeal should have been made to the Appellate Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County rather than to this court. The motion is without merit and is overruled. The defendant in error contends first that the penalty allowable by Code  56-706 is not part of the "amount involved" in actions in the Civil Court of Fulton County, and secondly, that in the instant case the question of penalty and attorney's fees allowable under Code  56-706 had been removed from the case and therefore the case became one involving only the amount claimed under the policy, i. e., $297.50. We do not agree with either contention. In National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Lain, <span class="casemissing">180 Ga. 463</span> (179 S. E. 120), and, s. c., <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 58 (1)</span> (179 S. E. 751), the courts in effect held that the attorney's fees allowable under Code  56-706 are not part of the "amount involved" because they were expressly excluded from the term "amount involved" by Ga. L. 1933, p. 290 et seq. That act excludes from the term "amount involved" the items of interest, attorney's fees, and costs. It does not exclude the penalty allowable under Code  56-706; therefore, that item where sued for is considered as part of the amount involved in the suit. See also, Tate v. Industrial Life &amp;c. Cas. Co., <span class="casemissing">58 Ga. App. 305</span>, 306 (1, 2) (198 S. E. 303). Pleadings alone determine the amount involved in a suit (Cox v. Dolvin Realty Co., <span class="casemissing">56 Ga. App. 649 (1)</span>, 193 S. E. 467), and the amount involved, so far as the jurisdictional amount regulating the mode of appeal is concerned, cannot be affected by the testimony of witnesses or by the finding of a jury. Taylor v. Blasingame, <span class="casemissing">73 Ga. 111</span>, 112 (2); Bell v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">93 Ga. 233</span> (18 S. E. 647); Simmons v. Allen, <span class="casemissing">26 Ga. App. 725</span>, 726 (106 S. E. 811). Nor can that amount be changed by the direction of a verdict. The amount involved in an action can only be changed by an actual amendment of the pleadings or by some action tantamount thereto. In Hamilton v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">79 Ga. App. 229</span> (53 S. E. 2d 234), relied on by the defendant in error, the plaintiff reduced the amount sued for in open court before the case was tried, and the case was tried on the theory of the reduced amount. Such action on the part of the plaintiff there amounted to amending the pleadings, and a verdict, either directed by the court or returned by a jury, was governed thereby. However, in the instant case the pleadings were never amended and the direction of a verdict by the court did not have the effect of amending the petition. If the petition had been amended to eliminate the issue of penalty and attorney's fees, that issue would not have been before the court for the court to direct a verdict thereon. It would be inconsistent to say that the issue had been eliminated from the case by action which was tantamount to an amendment when the trial judge directed a verdict on the issue.</div><div class="casepar">Since the amount involved, excluding interest, attorney fees, and costs exceeded $300, an appeal was properly made to this court rather than to the Appellate Division of the Civil Court of Fulton County.</div><div class="casepar">2. The evidence demanded a verdict for the defendant. In cases where the application for insurance is attached to and becomes a part of the policy, in order to avoid the policy for a misrepresentation of the applicant made in the application the insurer need only show that the representation was false and that it was material in that it changed the nature, extent, or character of the risk, and this is true although the applicant may have made the representation in good faith, not knowing that it was untrue. Preston v. National Life &amp;c. Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">196 Ga. 217</span>, 229 (26 S. E. 2d, 439, 148 A. L. R. 897). In the instant case the application contained the following question: "8. Have you, or any member of the family to be insured, ever had any disease of the heart, lungs, kidneys, stomach or bladder, or high blood pressure; paralysis, arthritis, venereal disease, cancer, diabetes, hernia, goiter or rectal disease or received other medical or surgical treatment or been advised that you should have a surgical operation? If so, explain fully below." To this question the applicant answered, "None." The application and policy were dated August 27, 1953.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Paul D. Vella, testifying in behalf of the plaintiff, testified in part: that he had treated Mrs. Wilson from October, 1949; that he attended Mrs. Wilson in St. Joseph's Infirmary in Atlanta where she was confined from September 13, 1953, until about October 17, 1953; that her reason for being admitted to the hospital was because she had had a "plain stroke"; that subsequently to October, 1949, he had treated Mrs. Wilson for "essential hypertension and arterial disease"; that from November, 1949, aside from "little initial examinations," he had given Mrs. Wilson complete examinations on three occasions; that she had arteriosclerosis, essential hypertension, and left bundle-branch block in the heart; that hypertension, or high blood pressure, can be a serious malady. This evidence demanded a finding that the answer to question number eight contained in the application was false.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence also demanded a finding that the misrepresentation was a material one. One test of the materiality of a misrepresentation is whether it influences the insurer in determining whether to accept the risk and what premium to charge. Lee v. Metropolitan Life Ins Co., <span class="casemissing">158 Ga. 517</span>, 520 (123 S. E. 737); Commercial Cas. Ins. Co. v. Jeffers, <span class="casemissing">69 Ga. App. 52 (3)</span> (24 S. E. 2d 815). The defendant introduced the testimony of two witnesses who had been employed by the defendant. Part of their duties as employees of the defendant had been to process applications for insurance. Both testified that if the answer to the question number eight of the application had shown that Mrs. Wilson was suffering from high blood pressure, in view of her age of 70 years, the application would have been turned down.</div><div class="casepar">297); Garrett v. Morris, <span class="casemissing">104 Ga. 84</span> (30 S. E. 685); Fountain v. L. &amp; N. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. App. 180</span> (6 S. E. 2d 105)." Winn v. Hinson, <span class="casemissing">64 Ga. App. 48</span>, 50 (2) (12 S. E. 2d 172).</div><div class="casepar">The evidence demanded a verdict for the defendant; therefore, the court erred in overruling the motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment reversed.
