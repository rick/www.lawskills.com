Deason was personally served with valid process but did not answer the divorce, custody, and child support action. On May 29, 1973, the parties entered into a written custody, child support, and property settlement agreement that was incorporated into the final judgment. The agreement provided that James Deason would pay to Sheryn Deason $70 per week in child support, which would decrease by $35 per week when each child attained the age of 21, became self-supporting, or married.</div><div class="casepar">As of April 30, 1994, James Deason was in arrearage in child support and owed Sheryn Deason back child support in the amount of $58,220. On April 30, 1994, the State of Florida, Department of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Services in Broward County, had Sheryn Deason execute an affidavit of child support which stated that, since January 1975, James E. Deason, Sr., had defaulted on payment of any child support.</div><div class="casepar">On November 20, 1997, the District Attorney for Gwinnett County filed a petition for enforcement of a foreign order by contempt under 28 USC  1738B against James E. Deason, Sr., for the State of Georgia, Department of Human Resources, ex rel. Sheryn C. Deason. On August 4, 1997, James E. Deason accepted, waived, and acknowledged service in the Petition for Enforcement of Foreign Order by Contempt under 28 USC  1738B and submitted to the jurisdiction and venue of the Superior Court of Gwinnett County. At the time the petition was filed, he was believed to be living at 3255 Trotter's Walk Circle, Snellville, Gwinnett County, Georgia; however, in his answer he denied this. Rule nisi issued on November 20, 1997, for a hearing on January 20, 1998, but was not received. On January 28, 1998, a summons and rule nisi were reissued for hearing on March 31, 1998. On April 23, 1998, the hearing was continued by court order until May 5, 1998. On May 5, 1998, James E. Deason filed an answer alleging that the judgment was dormant since 1980; that Sheryn C. Deason was guilty of laches in delay in collecting it; and that the allegations of the complaint were denied. On May 7, 1998, by written order the hearing was continued until June 16, 1998.</div><div class="casepar">The only evidence in the case consists of the verified petition and answer. There was no evidentiary hearing. The record is silent as to the following: whether there has been an effort to collect this arrearage earlier, and, if not, why not; whether there were any reasonable justifications for the delay; whether James E. Deason has hidden for the last 25 years or if his whereabouts were known; when he last lived in Florida; and whether he is a resident of Georgia, and, if so, for how long and where.</div><div class="casepar">On October 9, 1998, after hearing oral argument on the defenses, the trial court made the following findings of fact: the facts in the petition are correct; the petition claims an arrearage of $58,220, although the court made no finding that this was true; James E. Deason, Jr., became 21 on December 19, 1987; Jennie Deason became 21 on April 7, 1993; the petition for enforcement of foreign order by contempt to collect $58,220 in due and owing child support was filed five years, seven months, and thirteen days after the final installment was due; and no evidentiary hearing was held, but was based upon the undisputed facts urged by the parties.</div><div class="casepar">In the conclusions of law, the trial court relied exclusively upon Georgia substantive and procedural law to conclude that</div><div class="casepar">[a]limony judgments, like all other judgments, are subject to and controlled by our Dormancy and Revival Statutes and any applicable statute of limitation. A lump sum alimony judgment is dormant after the expiration of seven years, and is not subject to revival after the expiration of ten years. This applies to said payments due prior to July 1, 1997. [Cit.]</div><div class="casepar">"There is no question that child support judgments are subject to statutes regarding dormancy even though the enforcement of these judgments is by means of contempt action." Parker v. Eason, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../232/2/index.html">265 Ga. 236 (454 SE2d 460) (1995)</a></span>." On October 9, 1998, the trial court dismissed the complaint as barred by the statute of limitation. On December 9, 1998, appellate review under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/5/6/35/index.html">5-6-35</a></span> was granted. On December 11, 1998, notice of appeal was filed.</div><div class="casepar">1.

[Cits.] Giving that amendment a retroactive interpretation would have the far-reaching effect of authorizing initiation of a suit after July of 1997 to recover arrearages on any and all child or spousal support judgments that were entered in this state at any time prior to July of 1987. Our review of the 1997 enactment as a whole does not lead us to the conclusion that the General Assembly's implicit intent was that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/12/60/index.html">9-12-60</a></span> (d) [(Ga.

In fact, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/40.5/index.html">19-11-40.5</a></span> expressly provided that UIFSA and the other provisions of the Act apply to proceedings initiated on or after January 1, 1998, while URESA continued to apply to proceedings pending prior to January 1, 1998.

Id.</div><div class="casepar">While Ga. L. 1997, p. 1613, cannot be applied retroactively because of the language in its effective date, the Act can assist in determining the legislative intent regarding URESA and the public policy in Georgia regarding collection of foreign child support judgments. The General Assembly expressed through the Act the public policy of Georgia regarding several existing evils that it desired to correct through the Act: (1) judgments for child support, domestic or foreign, no longer are subject to a statute of limitation, Ga. L. 1997, pp. 1613, 1616,  1 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/20/index.html">9-3-20</a></span>); (2) judgments or orders for child support no longer become dormant, Ga. L. 1997, pp. 1613, 1616,  2 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/12/60/index.html">9-12-60</a></span> (d)); (3) each child support payment or installment is a judgment which, when due, is entitled to full faith and credit, Ga. L. 1997, pp. 1613, 1618,  6 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/6/17/index.html">19-6-17</a></span> (e) (1), (2)); (4) foreign support orders are unmodifiable, except by FFCCSOA, Ga. L. 1997, pp. 1613, 1619-1620,  7 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/6/26/index.html">19-6-26</a></span>); (5) the choice of law is determined, Ga. L. 1997, pp. 1613, 1674,  33 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/163/index.html">19-11-163</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/166/index.html">19-11-166</a></span>); and (6) many other statutory changes. "The recent amendment . . . affirms the legislative intent that a plaintiff have a broad [and liberal] right" regarding collection of a foreign child support judgment that was in arrearage; thus, it is appropriate in statutory construction to look to the recent legislative amendment that does not have retroactive application to determine the intent of the legislature regarding the statute prior to amendment. Porquez v. Washington, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../162/4/index.html">268 Ga. 649</a></span>, 652 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../162/4/index.html">492 SE2d 665</a></span>) (1997).</div><div class="casepar">(b) As originally enacted by Ga. L. 1958, pp. 34-35, 40,  2 and 8 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/1/42/index.html">19-1-42</a></span> (6); <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/51/index.html">19-11-51</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/63/index.html">19-11-63</a></span>), URESA did not specifically authorize an action to collect arrearages; Ga. L. 1979, p. 941,  1, 2 (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/43/index.html">19-11-43</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/51/index.html">19-11-51</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/63/index.html">19-11-63</a></span>); Brookins v.

Notwithstanding the absence of a provision specifically authorizing recovery for arrearages prior to 1979, such retroactive application was allowed; otherwise, the purpose of URESA would be defeated. See id. at 206-207; see also State of Ga. v. McKenna, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../604/3/index.html">253 Ga. 6</a></span>, 9 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../604/3/index.html">315 SE2d 885</a></span>) (1984); Ray v.

As in this case, an URESA action may be used to collect arrearages after the minor reaches majority; "[t]he fact that the child reached majority did not divest the trial court of its power to assure compliance with its previously entered order." Johnson v. State of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../462/04/index.html">167 Ga. App. 508</a></span>, 509 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../462/04/index.html">306 SE2d 756</a></span>) (1983). "URESA contains an additional procedure for registering and enforcing foreign judgments" other than by domesticating the foreign child support judgment. State of Ga. v. McKenna, supra at 9; OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/79/index.html">19-11-79</a></span> et seq. Thus, this action was not a domestication of a foreign child support judgment but, instead, was a registration of such judgment under URESA. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/19/11/79/index.html">19-11-79</a></span> et seq.</div><div class="casepar">The choice of law in URESA cases is governed by the law of the state of rendition of the child support judgment.

When URESA is not used to register a foreign child support judgment and the foreign child support judgment is domesticated, "for reasons of comity," "Georgia courts [will] recognize and give prospective enforcement to a foreign alimony or child support decree by establishing it as the decree of a Georgia court through domestication and treating it as though it were a local decree.

Any domesticated foreign judgment would be like a Georgia judgment, because it has been made a Georgia judgment by statute and court action, making it subject to any statute as to a dormancy provision. Brown v. Brown, supra at 726-727. However, any applicable statute of limitation provision would come under the laws of the rendition state as to a domesticated child support judgment or order.

Stat. Ann.  95.11 (1) (1960), the statute of limitation on a general judgment in the circuit court, a court of general jurisdiction, is 20 years for enforcement. See Massey v. Pineapple Orange Co., 100 S. 170 (Fla. 1924); Winter v. Allstate Mfg. Corp. of Fla., 303 S2d 399 (Fla. App. 1974). Further, Fla. Stat.

Florida, in enforcing URESA, does not apply its own statute of limitation for judgments to a foreign child support judgment. Frazier v. Frazier, =616 S2d 575, 579 (Fla. App. 1993); Wood v.

Accordingly, a[n] URESA action for child support arrearages cannot be viewed as a traditional "action on a foreign judgment." [Cit.] A[n] URESA action for child support arrearages seeks enforcement of a duty of support and it is a proceeding wherein the foreign judgment does not constitute the gist of the action, but is merely evidence from which the extent of the child support obligor's default in meeting his duty can be quantified. When consideration is given to the express legislative intent underlying enactment of URESA, it would be anomalous to hold that a[n] URESA action for child support arrearages is nevertheless subject to the same principles that would be applicable in a traditional "action on a foreign judgment." "The purpose of URESA is to improve the enforcement of the duty of support, not to impair that duty." Ray v. Ray, [supra at] 469. Rigid adherence to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/20/index.html">9-3-20</a></span> would not improve the enforcement of the duty of support but, in our increasingly mobile society, would make this state a haven for any child support obligor who had successfully evaded his duty to support his children for more than five years.

In fact, Florida has no dormancy provision regarding child support arrearages, because such arrearages are treated as an equitable proceeding. Dean v. Dean, 665 S2d 244 (Fla. App. 1995). Thus, the trial court erred in at least not considering the Florida statute of limitation as to judgments, in general, which was longer than OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/3/20/index.html">9-3-20</a></span>, even if it did not consider the absence of statutes of limitations and dormancy regarding Florida child support arrearages under Florida law.

Fowhand v. Piper, supra at 1310; see also Dean v. Dean, supra at 244. The obligor must show "substantial prejudice" due to the delay for laches to attach. See State v.

Thus, the trial court must determine whether Georgia or Florida equitable defenses can apply to an URESA action on a Florida child support judgment enforced in Georgia.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The effective date of 28 USCS  1738B was upon passage, October 20, 1994. Therefore, it must be determined under federal law whether the Act should have retroactive application to arrearages occurring prior to the effective date. The provisions of the Act itself do not expressly provide for retroactivity; however, the language of the Act looks to enforcement of child support orders or judgments that "have been issued" and "made" in the past and does not use present or prospective language only. The legislative history expressed the problem of interstate child support arrearages as comprising as much as 30 percent of the child support cases under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act and that this problem has been studied by the U. S. Commission on Interstate Child Support at Congress' direction since 1988. Such problem existed in the past and continues to the present with the same failures to pay, promising future continuation of the problem of arrearages into the future unless corrected. However, the legislative history does not expressly state the intent of Congress regarding retroactivity. The language and purpose of both the Act and the legislative history are that of remedial legislation, looking toward retroactive application to assist in the collection of past arrearages. 5 U. S. Code &amp; Congressional &amp; Admin. News, pp. 3259-3265 (1994). Thus, the problem will continue into the future, and the purpose of the Act would be frustrated unless it is applied retroactively, which would require that congressional intent be inferred through construction to imply retroactivity.</div><div class="casepar">The first question [in determining the congressional intent as to retroactivity] is not whether Congress intended the law to be remedial or substantive. The court should have first decided whether Congress had a more specific intention regarding whether the law should apply retroactively. Only if congressional intent on that point is unclear does the remedial/substantive distinction come into play. See Kaiser Aluminum [&amp; Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827 (110 SC 1570, 108 LE2d 842) (1990)] ("where the congressional intent is clear, it governs"); Mozee [v. American Commercial Marine Svc.

The statute merely reinforces an existing obligation of child support. It deals with remedial matters of great congressional concern, i.e., the inability to enforce interstate child support orders, resulting in arrearages. Finally, the obligor is not deprived of a right that has matured or become unconditional, because under Florida law, as well as Georgia law, the preexisting obligation remains the same. See Baynes v. AT&amp;T Technologies, supra at 1373-1374. Thus, under Bradley, the obligor suffers no manifest injustice when the Act is applied retroactively. See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, 520 U.
