Muscogee State Court. Before Judge Johnston.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Bridget Holt was found liable to Geneva Fortson for $82,000 in damages for personal injuries she caused Fortson in an automobile accident. After Holt's insurer, Southern General Insurance Company, paid the $15,000 limit under Holt's policy, Holt obtained a release from the balance of the judgment against her by assigning Fortson her claim against Southern General for compensatory damages arising from its negligent and bad faith failure to settle Fortson's claim against Holt within her policy limits, but retained her claim against Southern General for punitive damages arising from that tort. Holt and Fortson (represented by her trustee in bankruptcy) then brought suit against Southern General seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged bad faith failure to settle. Holt also asserted a claim against Southern General for intentional infliction of emotional distress and sought damages to her peace, happiness, and feelings under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/6/index.html">51-12-6</a></span>. A jury awarded $83,000 to Fortson as compensatory damages and $100,000 to Holt as punitive damages on the bad faith failure to settle within policy limits claim, and awarded $25,000 to Holt as compensatory damages on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Southern General appeals.</div><div class="casepar">1. We note initially that the propriety of Holt's assignment to Fortson of the compensatory damages aspect of her claim against Southern General for its bad faith failure to settle was not raised by any party to this appeal. Accordingly, we intimate no opinion whether that assignment was valid under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/44/12/24/index.html">44-12-24</a></span> as involving a right of action which involves "directly or indirectly, a right of property."

Appellant contends the trial court erred by denying its motions for directed verdict because the facts of the case sub judice do not present an issue for the jury concerning a negligent and bad faith failure to settle. "A directed verdict is authorized when 'there is no conflict in the evidence as to any material issue and the evidence introduced, with all reasonable deductions therefrom, shall demand a particular verdict. . . .' OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (a). Further, the evidence must be construed most favorably to the party opposing the motion. [Cit.] ' "The standard of appellate review of the trial court's denial of a motion for directed verdict is the 'any evidence' standard." ' [Cit.]" Foreman v. Eastern Foods, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../360/50/index.html">195 Ga. App. 332</a></span>, 333 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../360/50/index.html">393 SE2d 695</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">The transcript reveals that appellee Holt drove her car through a stop sign on June 19, 1987, striking appellee Fortson's vehicle. Holt's liability for the collision was uncontroverted, and appellant promptly paid Fortson's property damage claim. On July 27, 1987, appellant's claims representative wrote Fortson's attorney, Charles Gower, requesting information concerning Fortson's medical expenses and special damages for evaluation in regard to a settlement of her personal injury claim. By letter dated October 7, 1987, Gower offered to settle the claim for $30,000, informing appellant that Fortson had incurred $1,926 in medical expenses, $5,184 in lost wages, and that a nerve block procedure might be necessary at an expense of approximately $7,500. The October 7, 1987 offer to settle was withdrawn by letter dated October 13, 1987, which also notified appellant that Fortson had been hospitalized and that she might have a ruptured disc. By letter dated October 19, 1987, Gower informed appellant that Fortson was still hospitalized and had been told that she definitely had a ruptured disc. Gower requested appellant reveal its policy limits in order to facilitate settlement. Appellant refused that request in its letter dated October 28, 1987 and requested further medical information to substantiate Fortson's condition.</div><div class="casepar">On November 2, 1987, Gower made an offer to settle Fortson's claim against Holt at the policy limits upon proof of those limits, contingent upon appellant's acceptance of the offer within an arbitrary period of ten days. Gower enclosed the office notes of Fortson's physician and informed appellant that her medical expenses then exceeded $10,000 (enclosing two bills totalling $6,516 and an estimate of $4,000 for the hospital bill) and her lost wages exceeded $5,000. On November 9, 1987, Gower sent another letter, enclosing a copy of the lawsuit he intended to file on behalf of Fortson, and reiterated his offer of settlement at the policy limits within ten days of the November 2nd letter. Gower wrote again on November 10, 1987, enclosing a copy of Fortson's hospital bill for $4,335.50. By overnight delivery, Gower sent a letter dated November 12, 1987, which extended the offer of settlement at the policy limits through the close of business on November 17, 1987, and enclosed Fortson's complete medical record from her hospitalization, including x-rays related to surgery done to treat the injuries.</div><div class="casepar">It is uncontroverted that appellant did not communicate with Gower during the settlement offer period to accept, reject, counteroffer, or request an extension of time. It is also uncontroverted that appellant did not contact Holt to inform her that Fortson was considering bringing suit against her, that Fortson had given appellant documents indicating her injuries might exceed the policy limits, or that an offer to settle within policy limits had been made by Fortson's attorney.</div><div class="casepar">On November 18, 1987, Gower wrote to appellant noting the passage of the deadline for settlement and the absence of any response by appellant to the offer, and informing appellant that Fortson would no longer settle for the policy limits. Two days later, on November 20th, appellant's representative contacted Gower by telephone and offered to settle at the policy limit. That offer and a repeat offer to settle on the same terms, which was made subsequent to the filing of Fortson's action, were rejected.</div><div class="casepar">"It is no longer open to question in this State that the claim of an insured under an automobile liability policy for damages on account of the bad faith tortious refusal of the insurer to settle a liability claim against [her] within the policy limits resulting in damage to [her] in the form of a judgment in excess of the policy limits being returned against [her] is a legitimate charge against the insurer upon which recovery may be had by the insured. [Cits.]" Shaw v. Caldwell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/63/index.html">229 Ga. 87</a></span>, 91 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../130/63/index.html">189 SE2d 684</a></span>) (1972). See McCall v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/6/index.html">251 Ga. 869 (310 SE2d 513) (1984)</a></span>. In deciding whether to accept an offer to settle a claim within policy limits, the insurer "must accord the interest of its insured the same faithful consideration it gives its own interest. . . ."

App. 515</a></span>, 519 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../618/18/index.html">181 SE2d 704</a></span>) (1971). "[I]t is for the jury to decide whether the insurer has or has not so acted." Id. See also National Emblem Ins. Co. v. Pritchard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../564/40/index.html">140 Ga. App. 350 (1) (231 SE2d 126) (1976)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence adduced at trial thus showed that Holt's liability for Fortson's injuries arising out of the collision was uncontroverted, as appellant acknowledged by promptly paying Fortson's property damages; that appellant, while conducting no investigation itself, was kept informed that Fortson had suffered bodily injury as a result of the collision and that her physical condition was deteriorating; and that four and a half months after the collision, Fortson's attorney extended an offer to settle Fortson's claims within the policy limits on November 2nd for a duration ultimately extended to November 17th, an offer which appellant never communicated to Holt. While the time period set by Gower was arbitrarily brief, appellant never contacted Gower to request an extension even for the two days which the evidence demonstrated was all the extra time appellant needed before it could accept the offer.</div><div class="casepar">Notwithstanding the above evidence and persuasive foreign case law indicating that appellant's behavior in failing to inform Holt of the settlement offer (see State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Smoot, 381 F2d 331, 338 (5th Cir. 1967); Riske v. Truck Ins. Exchange, 490 F2d 1079, 1085 (8th Cir. 1974)) and failing to settle when the insured's liability was uncontestable (compare Hall v. Preferred Acc. Ins. Co., 204 F2d 844, 848 (5th Cir. 1953)), demonstrates bad faith or negligence in the refusal to settle a claim within policy limits, appellant argues a verdict in its favor was demanded on the bad faith failure to settle because it breached no duty owed to Holt. Specifically, appellant argues it was not required to take into consideration the arbitrary time limit set by Gower for acceptance of the settlement offer but instead was entitled to evaluate and process that offer according to its established internal operating procedures, which it asserts the evidence showed it followed here with all due haste.</div><div class="casepar">First, looking to an insurer's obligation to consider an arbitrarily time-limited settlement offer, because a person injured by an insurance company's policyholder occupies no contractual or fiduciary relationship with the insurer or the insured, see Jones v. Southern Homes Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../580/87/index.html">135 Ga. App. 385</a></span>, 389 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../580/87/index.html">217 SE2d 620</a></span>) (1975), that person can set any time for acceptance of a settlement offer, even an unreasonable and arbitrary time. However, an insurer need not be governed by such time limit. See Martin v. Hartford Acc. &amp;c. Co., 39 Cal. Rptr. 342, 347 (1964). Rather, the issue is whether the insurer acted in good faith or bad faith, and that is to be determined by the circumstances of each case. Id.</div><div class="casepar">In order to act in a manner consistent with its duty to give equal consideration to the interests of the insured, Exum, supra; United States F. &amp; G. Co. v. Evans, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/79/index.html">116 Ga. App. 93</a></span>, 96-97 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../638/79/index.html">156 SE2d 809</a></span>), aff'd <span class="casecite"><a href="../../152/00/index.html">223 Ga. 789 (158 SE2d 243) (1967)</a></span>, we hold that an insurer may not fail to give appropriate consideration to a settlement offer which may reduce the financial burden upon the insured merely because the settlement offer is of limited duration. Although there may be situations in which, given the valid business concerns of the ordinary prudent insurer, the time restriction in a settlement offer may be so unreasonable under the circumstances of the claim that as a matter of law an insurer could not appropriately consider it, a determination of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the time in the offer will usually be a question for the trier of fact. See Bearden Mercantile Co. v. Madison Oil Co., <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 695</span>, 702 (3) (<span class="casemissing">58 SE 200</span>) (1907); accord J. L. v. State of Ga., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../540/22/index.html">147 Ga. App. 818</a></span>, 819 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../540/22/index.html">250 SE2d 559</a></span>) (1978). That determination will necessarily be based on the fact that for an insurer, which must weigh the risks and rewards related to a settlement offer, the impending expiration of a time-limited offer is but one of many elements to be given appropriate consideration. Accordingly, in considering whether an insurer's failure to accept a settlement offer was negligent or in bad faith, the trier of fact must determine whether the time period provided in the offer was sufficient under the circumstances to enable the insurer to complete its evaluation and processing of the offer.</div><div class="casepar">In the case sub judice, the evidence established that the settlement offer was processed under appellant's internal operating procedures whereby all claims were handled in the order of their arrival at appellant's place of business, with no special consideration or priority given to any claim, regardless whether the claim was contested, whether the claim involved an insured or a party injured by an insured, or whether the claim involved a time-limited offer to settle within policy limits. Based on this evidence of its methods of evaluating and processing claims, appellant argues that a verdict in its favor was demanded because it was uncontroverted that under these procedures appellant could not have appropriately considered the settlement offer within the time restraints set by Gower. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">We reject appellant's argument that an insurer's conduct must be viewed exclusively within the context of the scale of its operations and the internal procedures it has promulgated in order to conduct its business in the fashion it prefers, regardless of the impact those claims procedures may have upon its insureds' interests. The law imposes upon the insurer the duty to " 'exercise diligence, intelligence, good faith, and honest and conscientious fidelity to the common interest of the insured as well as itself in determining whether to accept or reject an offer of settlement. While the insurer may properly give consideration to its own interest, it must in good faith give at least equal consideration to the interest of the insured, and if it fails to do so, it acts in bad faith. [Cits.]' " Smoot, supra at 338. See also McCall, supra at 8,71 (1), and Evans, supra at 97. Given that duty, to accept appellant's argument would be to authorize insurers to place greater importance on their own interests in the regulation of internal business operations than they place on the interests of their policyholders. This we decline to do. In carrying out its duty to give appropriate consideration to settlement offers of limited duration, an insurer cannot justify its failure to give equal consideration to its insureds' interests by relying on internal operating procedures promulgated by the insurer when the effect of such procedures is to prevent the insurer from giving the settlement offer that consideration.</div><div class="casepar">"A verdict shall be directed only when the evidence demands -- as distinguished from merely seeming to preponderate towards -- a certain verdict." Morris v. Futch, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/78/index.html">193 Ga. App. 132</a></span>, 133 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/78/index.html">386 SE2d 905</a></span>) (1989). The transcript reveals evidence from which the jury could have found that appellant was adequately informed that Fort-son's claim was a policy limits case prior to the expiration of the settlement demand and that appellant was provided with sufficient medical records to document that Fortson's bodily injuries exceeded Holt's policy limits. There was evidence that appellant's failure to act timely on the offer was the result of appellant's rigid adherence to internal procedures, and that the effect of those procedures, with their lack of recognition of the relative weights of differing claims, was to elevate appellant's interest in the uniform management of its claims process over Holt's interest in having a claim exposing her to financially ruinous liability settled within her policy limits. This evidence, in addition to the inferences the jury could have drawn from appellant's failure to request an extension of time from Gower, authorized the jury to find that appellant's failure to respond to the settlement offer prior to its November 17, 1987 expiration constituted a breach of the duty it owed its insured. See Grumbling v. Medallion Ins. Co., 392 FSupp. 717 (Ore. 1975); Andrews v. Central Surety Ins. Co., 271 FSupp. 814 (SC 1967).</div><div class="casepar">Although after considering the closely contested facts adduced by the parties, the jury in the case sub judice might have found in favor of the insurer, as did the jury in DeLaune v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 314 S2d 601 (Fla. App. 1975), quoted at length by the dissent, and the trial court in the bench trial in Clauss v. Fortune Ins. Co., 523 S2d 1177 (Fla. App. 1988), applying as we must the "any evidence" rule, we cannot hold as a matter of law that there was " 'not more than a scintilla' " of evidence, Jiffy Store v. Bishop, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../381/18/index.html">190 Ga. App. 716</a></span>, 717 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../381/18/index.html">379 SE2d 602</a></span>) (1989) to support the jury's verdict here. Therefore, as the transcript contains some evidence in support of appellees' claim and as the evidence with all reasonable deductions did not demand a verdict for the insurer, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/50/index.html">9-11-50</a></span> (a), the trial court did not err by denying appellant's motions for a directed verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant also argues, citing Adduci v. Vigilant Ins. Co., 424 NE2d 645, 649 (Ill. App. 1981), that its acceptance of the expired offer to settle Fortson's claim within Holt's policy limits constituted an absolute defense to any liability since there was absolutely no evidence at trial as to why the settlement offer, which was good on November 17, 1987, was unavailable to the insurer two days later. But see Martin, supra at 346 (rejecting insurer's argument that its purported acceptance of an expired offer constitutes an "absolute defense" to a charge of bad faith failure to settle within policy limits). Appellant's argument, relied upon by the dissent, challenges the proposition that appellant's breach of its duty was the proximate cause of Holt's injury (i.e., the verdict in excess of the policy limits), and is based on the assertion that appellant was not liable because it was Fortson's action in rejecting appellant's untimely acceptance of the expired offer to settle that caused Holt's injury, not appellant's action in failing to respond timely to that offer.</div><div class="casepar">We do not agree with this argument that an insurer's so-called "acceptance" of an expired offer which the injured party then rejects serves to absolve the insurer from all damages suffered by the insured as a result of the insurer's earlier bad faith failure to settle. It is well established law in Georgia that " '[t]he causal connection between an original act of negligence and injury to another is not broken by the "intervening" act of a third person, if the nature of such intervening act was such that it could reasonably have been anticipated or foreseen by the original wrong-doer.'

[Cit.]" (Emphasis supplied.))</div><div class="casepar">An injured party's rejection of an insurer's untimely "acceptance" of an expired settlement offer does not break the chain of causation because it is a reasonable and foreseeable effect of the insurer's failure to settle pursuant to the terms set forth in the offer that the untimely or otherwise nonconforming "acceptance" will be refused, either on reasonable grounds, such as the injured party's decision to pursue a greater recovery from the insured or, given the adversarial positions occupied by the parties, on wholly unreasonable grounds. Since the injured party is within his or her rights and breaches no duty owing the insurer or the insured by rejecting a nonconforming "acceptance," it follows that the "intervening act," i.e., the rejection of the late acceptance, would not be sufficient in and of itself to cause the injury to the insured. See Southern R. Co. v. Webb, <span class="casemissing">116 Ga. 152 (42 SE 395) (1902)</span>. At best, the insurer's "acceptance" of an expired offer may constitute evidence that the insurer, realizing its error, attempted to minimize the damages it may have caused its insured. Accordingly, this argument presents no meritorious basis for reversing the trial court's denial of appellant's motions for a directed verdict.</div><div class="casepar">3. Appellant contends the trial court erred by denying its motion to dismiss the complaint.

We find no error in the trial court's refusal to give a requested charge on the effect of appellees' failure to exercise ordinary care to avoid the consequences of appellant's negligence. Appellant's argument in support of this enumeration is addressed solely to Fortson, who appellant maintains was unreasonable as a matter of law in refusing to accept appellant's tardy settlement offer. As discussed in Division 2, supra, we reject any suggestion that Fortson was ever under any duty to compromise her claim against Holt or otherwise shelter Holt from the effect of appellant's negligence. Insofar as Fortson stands in the shoes of Holt as her assignee, but see Division 1, supra, we note that Holt was unable to avoid the negligence of appellant since the settlement offers were not communicated to her.</div><div class="casepar">5. We agree with appellant that the trial court erred by denying its motions for directed verdict as to Holt's claim for compensatory damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Holt's claim accused appellant of no conduct more egregious than not acting to prevent a lawsuit from being filed and a judgment in excess of policy limits from being obtained against her. Although Holt testified she had never been sued before and that she and her husband had no assets to satisfy Fort-son's judgment against her, Holt nevertheless knew she was responsible for Fortson's injuries because she admitted she caused the accident which was the basis of Fortson's suit. Holt stated she cried when her husband telephoned her in December 1987 to tell her the suit had been filed and that she was later unable to put the matter out of her mind. Holt testified she was not informed about the settlement offer and appellant's untimely response, and the transcript does not reflect when she became aware that appellant's bad faith failure to settle exposed her to a judgment in excess of her policy limits. Trial was had on Fortson's suit in July 1988, although Holt did not testify in person (a videotaped deposition was used) and within two months thereafter, Holt assigned her claim against appellant to Fortson. The only other evidence submitted was Holt's testimony that she has not driven a car since her accident with Fortson because the lawsuit made her afraid she would be sued again.</div><div class="casepar">This court has held that the preparation and filing of legal pleadings is not sufficient as a matter of law to sustain a party's subsequent cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the one who had filed suit against him, Savell, Williams, Cox &amp; Angel v.

Based on the facts and holdings in these cases, neither the filing and litigation of Fortson's suit nor the entry of a judgment against Holt in excess of her policy limits constituted acts so outrageous or egregious that they naturally gave rise to the intense feelings of humiliation, embarrassment, fright or extreme outrage necessary to cause severe emotional distress. Moses, supra.</div><div class="casepar">As to Holt's crying, anxiety over the trial, and her reluctance to drive, we have held that "the severity of the emotional distress allegedly produced by the defendant['s] conduct is also a factor in determining liability for mental distress. [Cit.] The law will intervene only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it. [Cit.] It is for the court to determine whether on the strength of the evidence severe emotional distress can be found. [Cit.]" Quinones v.

We find as a matter of law that a reasonable person could have endured the degree of distress generated by the lawsuit and judgment thereon, and thus hold that Holt's alleged emotional distress did not meet the above severity requirement. See Moses, supra at 226.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, as an alternate basis for reversing the denial of appellant's motions for a directed verdict on the emotional distress tort, it appears that while the complaint asserted two separate torts which, had they both been proven, would have authorized recovery of compensatory and punitive damages under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/4/index.html">51-12-4</a></span>; <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> on the bad faith failure to settle claim and also damages under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/6/index.html">51-12-6</a></span> on the separate claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the transcript reveals that no independent evidence was adduced to support Holt's claim for damages for her emotional distress but rather that she relied exclusively on the facts used to establish the claim for both compensatory and punitive damages for appellant's bad faith failure to settle within policy limits. Thus, the evidence actually presented at trial established only one tort, that of appellant's bad faith failure to settle. It follows that because the jury awarded actual damages for this tort, the "entire injury" was not exclusively to Holt's peace, happiness, or feelings, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/6/index.html">51-12-6</a></span>, and accordingly, Holt was not entitled to recover those damages.

Thus, the award of both punitive damages and damages for Holt's wounded feelings constituted an impermissible double recovery. See Westview Cemetery v.

Appellant contends the trial court erred by denying its motions for a directed verdict as to the punitive damages based on its tortious failure to settle within policy limits. Appellant's liability for this tort arose on November 17, 1987, the last day appellant could have accepted Gower's offer to settle Fortson's claim against Holt within the policy limits. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> applies to causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1987. Id. at (h).

OCGA  51-1 2-5.1 (b).</div><div class="casepar">Applying that standard to the facts at hand, we hold the trial court did not err by denying appellant's motions for a directed verdict on the punitive damages. Affirmative evidence was adduced that appellant failed to accord Fortson's time-limited settlement offer any special consideration under its internal operating procedures, even though it knew or should have known that its failure to act on the offer might leave Holt personally liable for a judgment in excess of her policy limits; that appellant failed to write or even telephone Gower to seek an extension of the deadline, even though recognizing that the result of its decision to follow its internal procedures eliminated the possibility of evaluating and processing the settlement offer within the time limit; and that appellant failed to inform Holt about the suit Fortson was considering, about the documents Fortson had submitted indicating her injuries exceeded $15,000, and about the offer to settle the claim for the $15,000 policy limits, thereby depriving Holt of any opportunity she might have had to negotiate her own agreement with Fortson.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence established that every aspect of appellant's conduct in this case was deliberate and intentional, and was the conscious and calculated result of appellant's decision to give greater importance to its interests in its internal operating procedures than it gave to the interests of its insureds. The evidence adduced at trial established that rather than alter its internal operating procedures to accommodate time-limited settlement offers, appellant deliberately gambled with its insureds' interests, betting their exposure to a verdict in excess of the policy limits against either the injured party's acceptance of appellant's untimely response to the settlement offer or the injured party's inability to prove damages in excess of the policy limits at trial. By pursuing this course of action appellant had everything to gain and nothing of its own to lose: it would benefit financially if the injured party's claim proved bogus or insignificant; it would be responsible only for the policy limits if the claim proved valid. The only interests at risk in the case at bar were Holt's, whom appellant kept ignorant of the gamble it was taking with her financial future. From this evidence, the jury was authorized to conclude that appellant had acted with an entire want of care to the consequences to Holt, and that punitive damages were necessary to penalize or punish this behavior.</div><div class="casepar">Further, in view of the insistent testimony by appellant's employees that appellant "met [its] legal obligations" by handling the settlement offer in a manner that placed paramount importance on its internal business operations notwithstanding the negative impact on its insureds' interests, and the evidence indicating that appellant's actions in the case at bar were not unique to Holt but reflected appellant's treatment of all similarly positioned insureds, the jury was entitled to conclude that appellant was so convinced its tortious behavior was acceptable that it would continue in its behavior unless the jury, through its verdict, could convince it otherwise. From this evidence, the jury was authorized to conclude that in order to deter appellant from continuing to act with conscious indifference to the consequences to its insureds, punitive damages were necessary.</div><div class="casepar">The jury found appellant liable for $83,000 as actual damages for its tortious behavior and for $100,000 in punitive damages, an amount well within the maximum set by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (g) and which, unlike the situation in Colonial Pipeline Co. v.

Id. at 405 (3). That case presents facts in marked contrast to those present in the case sub judice, where Gower's activities were restricted to settlement negotiations conducted entirely by correspondence, where there was no question regarding the contents or authenticity of that correspondence, and where appellant had admitted receipt of the correspondence in its answer. Rather than being "crucial" to the case, id., Gower's testimony could only have added to the evidence presented through exhibits admitted at trial.

DeLaune v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 314 S2d 601 at 603 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975).</div><div class="casepar">Contrary to the majority's implication, DeLaune, supra, did not simply uphold a jury verdict for the insurer applying an "any evidence" rule. Rather, the court held, "the evidence fails to prove any negligence, must less negligence rising to the level of bad faith. . . ." DeLaune, supra at 602. DeLaune expresses the majority, and I believe better reasoned, analysis as to arbitrary time-restricted offers. See also Adduci v. Vigilant Ins. Co., 424 NE2d 645 (Ill. App. 1981); American Mut. Ins. Co. of Boston v. Bittle, 338 A2d 306 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1975); Clauss v. Fortune Ins. Co., 523 S2d 1177 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988); Baton v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 584 F2d 907 (9th Cir. 1978); Bailey v. Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., 322 FSupp. 387 (W.D. La. 1969); but see Andrews v. Central Surety Ins. Co., 271 FSupp. 814 (S.C. 1967).</div><div class="casepar">Pritchard, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../564/40/index.html">140 Ga. App. 350 (231 SE2d 126) (1976)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Additionally, assuming for purposes of this decision that Southern General's failure to accept the policy limits offer prior to the close of business on November 17, 1987, would authorize a jury to find that it had, through bad faith or negligence, breached its duty to Holt at that time, there is no evidence that the breach was the legal cause of Holt's damage. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Three days after the expiration of the policy limits offer to settle expired, Southern General offered to settle for the policy limits. This offer remained "on the table" through the entry of the verdict against Holt some seven months later. Thus, it was incumbent upon Fortson to prove that the legal cause of Holt's harm was attributable to Southern General, rather than to Fortson, or Fortson's attorney. "No facts sufficiently indicate why [Fortson] found it impossible to accept the offer at [another] time, so as to fairly place the blame for failure of settlement upon [Southern General]." Adduci, supra at 649.</div><div class="casepar">Under the majority opinion, policy limits are meaningless in the face of a "Holt letter." I cannot agree.</div><div class="casepar">3. Because of my disagreement with the majority's conclusion in Division 2, I necessarily must dissent from the majority's conclusion in Division 6.</div><div class="casepar">4. In light of my conclusion regarding Division 2, I believe that attorney Gower's proper role in the case sub judice would be that of a witness, rather than of an advocate. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from Division 7 of the majority opinion.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Presiding Judge Birdsong joins in this dissent.</div><div class="casepar">Kelly, Denney, Pease &amp; Allison, Allen C.

      The majority also concludes "that appellant's behavior in failing to inform Holt of the settlement offer . . . demonstrates bad faith or negligence in the refusal to settle a claim within policy limits. . . ." However, the majority fails to discuss how this might have contributed to Holt's harm.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Freeman &amp; Hawkins, Paul M.
