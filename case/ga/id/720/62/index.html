Jordan brought suit in Mitchell Superior Court against Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company and H. Wyche, locomotive engineer of the company, seeking to recover $2000 damages for damage to an automobile owned by her, which she alleged was struck and wrecked by a freight train of said company at a public crossing in the City of Camilla, Georgia. In her petition, as amended, the plaintiff set up: that around 11 p.m. on November 5, 1949, her automobile was being driven in an easterly direction on Broad Street in said city and approached the point therein where said street is intersected by the tracks of the railroad company; that said automobile was being operated in a careful manner and at a speed of around 15 or 20 miles an hour; that the driver of the plaintiff's automobile approached this railroad crossing cautiously and looked in both directions for the approach of a train; that the automobile went upon the tracks without notice of the approach of the train; that the view of the driver of the plaintiff's car of the approaching train, which came from the north, was obstructed by reason of the railroad station, and no signal of the approach of the train was given, and the plaintiff's car was violently struck by this train, the engine of which was operated by the defendant Wyche, and which was at the time proceeding southward along said tracks and over said crossing at an excessive speed of 60 to 65 miles an hour; that said railroad station is located on the west side of and closely adjacent to said railroad tracks and on the north side of said Broad Street; that said street runs east and west and said railroad tracks run north and south at this crossing; that, immediately west of the station and along the north side of said street is a filling station and also certain residences, and that the location of said buildings, together with the fact that there were located on the railroad track nearest the station several boxcars, made it impossible for the driver of the plaintiff's automobile to see or notice the approaching train, not having been warned of its approach either by the tolling of the bell, blowing of the whistle or otherwise, and not being able to see any lights from said train. The plaintiff further alleged that--due to the location of said station and the other buildings near the same, in a thickly settled portion of said city of several thousand population, with many houses on both sides of said street which obstruct the view of one approaching the crossing from the west along said street, the same being a main artery of said city for vehicular traffic and a public highway of Georgia, and said crossing being thus dangerous and hazardous to the public, many hundred automobiles passing over the same daily--the railroad company was grossly negligent in not maintaining at such crossing a watchman at all times, and in failing to maintain a proper signalling device to warn and protect motorists and others on said street passing over this crossing. The plaintiff further set up that the railroad company and its agents--knowing of the hazardous nature of this crossing, and of the conditions with reference to the location of its buildings, and other buildings obstructing the view of the trains coming from the north to those traveling east along said highway, and knowing of the absence of a watchman or signalling device at said crossing--were further grossly negligent in failing to stop or slow the train sufficiently to have a member of its crew go in advance thereof and flag the crossing before the train moved over it. It was further alleged that the negligent acts of the defendants were the sole and proximate cause of the collision which damaged the plaintiff's car; that the defendants were grossly negligent in failing to exercise ordinary care and diligence in approaching this crossing so as to avoid injury to persons properly using this crossing; that, under the facts alleged in the petition as amended, the engineer should have had such engine under control to the extent that he could have brought the same to a complete stop when it became apparent that motorists were approaching on said crossing, and particularly in view of the fact that said engineer was negligent, in giving no warning of his approach to said crossing as provided by law and as required by the exercise of ordinary care for the safety of</div><div class="casepar">others; in the failure of said engineer to keep and maintain a constant and vigilant lookout along the track ahead of the engine while moving within the corporate limits of said city, so as to avoid injury to persons and property on said crossing, or within fifty feet thereof; in failing to observe the ordinance of said city, which prohibits any train from going through its corporate limits at a speed in excess of 40 miles an hour; in approaching said crossing at an excessive speed of 60 to 65 miles an hour; and in failing to signal the approach of said train to this crossing by constantly tolling the bell on the locomotive or otherwise; and in failing to maintain at all times at such crossing a watchman to warn the public of the approach of trains and in failing to maintain at such crossing a proper signalling device to protect automobile operators and the public on said street passing over the crossing.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants demurred generally and specially to the petition, and to the judgment overruling the demurrer excepted pendente lite, assigning error thereon in the bill of exceptions.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants denied the material allegations of the petition, and set up that the plaintiff's automobile was damaged by reason of the negligence of the driver thereof and his failure to exercise due care and precaution in approaching this crossing, and that had he done so he could have observed the approaching train.</div><div class="casepar">The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $1407.90. Judgment for said sum and costs was entered thereon.</div><div class="casepar">The defendants thereupon filed their motion for a new trial on the general grounds, and by amendment added certain special grounds. The trial judge overruled such motion, and to this judgment the defendants except.</div><div class="casepar"> 1. The defendants concede that the petition, as amended, set out a cause of action good as against general demurrer; but insist that the special demurrer to the allegations of the petition that the defendants were grossly negligent in the failure of the engineer to keep and maintain a constant and vigilant lookout along the track ahead of the engine while moving within the corporate limits of said city, so as to avoid injury to persons and property on such crossing or within fifty feet thereof, was well taken and should have been sustained because said allegations set forth no basis of legal liability against the defendants; it being urged that, "since it is alleged in substance that neither the driver of the automobile nor petitioner's son could see the approaching train because of the station and shed, it follows that the engineer would have been unable to see the approach of the automobile to the crossing; therefore, it is apparent in the above allegation of said petition that the failure of the engineer to maintain a constant and vigilant lookout down the track was not and could not have been a contributing cause of the accident." The defendants cite in support of this contention W. &amp; A. R. v. Crawford, <span class="casemissing">47 Ga. App. 591</span> (170 S. E. 824), W. &amp; A. R. v. Leslie, <span class="casemissing">48 Ga. App. 714 (3)</span> (173 S. E. 170), and Wise v. A. &amp; W. P. R. Co., <span class="casemissing">61 Ga. App. 372</span>, 375 (6 S. E. 2d, 135). While these cases, under the facts therein appearing, hold substantially that the allegations in the petition to the effect that the approach of the defendant's train could not be observed by the plaintiff by reason of the obstructions along the track of the defendant, and that by reason of the defendant's failure to keep a proper lookout the plaintiff was injured, were subject to demurrer, in that, if the obstructions were such that the plaintiff could not see the approaching train of the defendant, then the defendant railroad company's servants could not, for the same reason, see the approach of the plaintiff to the crossing--it appears from the allegations of the petition, as amended, in this case that, had the defendant railroad company's engineer maintained a proper and vigilant lookout ahead of the locomotive as the train approached this crossing, he could have seen the several boxcars, and, knowing of the static condition of the crossing as to the railroad station and buildings, would have known that the boxcars along said track reduced the vision of anyone approaching the crossing from the west along Broad Street as to the train approaching the crossing from the north. These allegations, under the facts set out in the petition, as amended, were not subject to the special demurrer urged, and presented a jury question. The court did not err in overruling this ground of demurrer.</div><div class="casepar">See generally, as to obstructions along the track of the railroad at a public crossing obstructing the view of approaching motorists, Callaway v. Pickard, <span class="casemissing">68 Ga. App. 637</span> (23 S. E. 2d, 564).</div><div class="casepar">2. There are thirteen special grounds added to the original motion for new trial. Special grounds numbered 9, 13, and 16 have been abandoned. In special ground 4 the defendants contend that the court erred in charging the jury that the defendants contended that the damage to the plaintiff's car, if any, was due to the negligence of the driver thereof, because one of their contentions was that the plaintiff's son, as well as such driver, was negligent in not using due care in approaching said crossing and in not keeping a lookout and observing the approaching train. The evidence disclosed that the plaintiff's son was not in charge of the operation of the car at this time, but had been hurt in a football game and had asked another person, Andy Morrell, to drive him home in this car, and that the plaintiff's son was resting on the back seat of the car at the time, having nothing to do with the operation of the car. The failure of the court to state in this charge that the defendants so contended does not, under the facts of this case and the charge as given, require a reversal.</div><div class="casepar">In special grounds 5 and 15 the defendants contend that the court erred in failing to charge that the law imposed upon the plaintiff's son the duty of exercising ordinary care on the occasion in question, and that, if he failed to do so and such failure was the proximate cause of the wreck and damage to the plaintiff's car, she would not be entitled to recover. Under the facts appearing, the court did not err in failing so to charge. There was no duty incumbent upon the plaintiff's son, at the time, to participate in the operation of the plaintiff's automobile. He had turned the operation of the car over to Andy Morrell, and he was resting on the back seat thereof, because of his injury, and had nothing to do with the operation of the car. Furthermore, any lookout by him would have been as fruitless as the lookout by the driver as he approached this crossing, due to the obstructions consisting of the depot, buildings, stationary boxcars, and the alleged failure of the train to signal its approach to the crossing. The jury determined that the driver of the plaintiff's car was not so negligent in failing to observe the approaching train as to preclude a recovery by the plaintiff and if, under such facts, the driver of the car was not so negligent as to preclude a recovery for failure on his part to observe the approaching train, then the plaintiff's son would not be so negligent in failing to observe the approach of the train to this crossing. There was nothing in the evidence that the plaintiff's son, by any act or omission of any duty incumbent upon him, caused or contributed to the damage to the plaintiff's car. The court did not err in failing to charge that, if the plaintiff's son could have avoided the consequences caused by the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, as contended in the 5th and 15th special grounds.</div><div class="casepar">The failure of the court to charge, as requested in special ground 6, to the effect that it was the duty of Andy Morrell, the driver of the car, on approaching this crossing to drive the automobile at such rate of speed and to keep such lookout as would meet the requirements of ordinary care, taking into consideration all the facts and conditions then existing, as appears front the evidence, does not show error and, besides, the question of the exercise of due care by the driver of said car in approaching the crossing was adequately dealt with by the court in the charge as a whole.</div><div class="casepar">The principle of law embraced in special ground 7, as to a person using his senses of sight and hearing on approaching a crossing in the exercise of ordinary care, was adequately covered by the court. Besides, under the facts, the jury were authorized to find that the driver exercised due care on approaching this crossing, and also that he could not have observed said approaching train because of said obstructions and the failure of the train to signal its approach by the tolling of its bell or otherwise. The court did not err in failing to give the instruction requested in this ground. The request embraced in ground 8 was adequately covered in the charge as given, and under the facts no error appears. The failure of the court to charge the instruction requested in special ground 10, to the effect that it was the duty of the driver of the car, in view of the obstructions to his view as he approached the crossing, to have stopped and listened before attempting to cross, was not error under the facts,</div><div class="casepar">66 SEPTEMBER TERM, 1950. [33 Ga.</div><div class="casepar">considering the entire charge of the court. The principle contained in the 11th special ground was adequately covered in the charge as given, and no error appears. There was no contention that there was any statute requiring the defendant company to maintain a watchman at this crossing, and the court did not err in failing to charge the instruction embraced in special ground 12. Besides, the question as to whether it was required of the defendant to have a watchman at such crossing or to give signals or warning of the train approaching, in order to meet the requirements of ordinary care for the safety of persons using the crossing, was sufficiently covered by the charge as a whole.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err, as contended in special ground 14, in failing to give the instructions therein embraced, dealing with negligence and defining ordinary care. The law embraced therein was adequately covered by the charge as given.</div><div class="casepar">3. The evidence for the plaintiff tended to substantiate the allegations of her petition, as amended, which the defendants conceded was good as against general demurrer and set out a cause of action and valid grounds of negligence. The case was properly submitted to the jury. The evidence authorized the verdict in the plaintiff's favor, and no error of law appears from any of the special grounds requiring a new trial. Therefore, the court did not err in overruling the defendant's motion for new trial as amended.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed. MacIntyre, P.
