Fayette State Court. Before Judge Sams.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This Fayette County case arose as a part of a lengthy, ongoing dispute between appellant Anthony Carter and a neighbor, Lester Walden, which dispute was, apparently, referred to locally as the "Carter/Walden feud." In this instance, a jury found appellant Carter guilty of misdemeanor criminal trespass for piling dirt against Walden's fence, thereby causing damage to the fence and to Walden's property. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> In addition to the above conviction, appellant, who represented himself at trial, ignored numerous warnings by the trial court and repeatedly cast aspersions upon Lester Walden during his cross-examination of Walden, thereby engendering another conviction for criminal contempt of court. Pro se, Carter appeals both convictions. We affirm both.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A98A0074: Criminal Trespass</div><div class="casepar">1. Upon arrest and prior to the presentment of the accusation charging him with criminal trespass, appellant filed a pro se demand for speedy trial. He claims he was denied his speedy trial rights. We disagree. To the extent that appellant's pro se contentions encompass such right pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/170/index.html">17-7-170</a></span> (a), the demand was not filed timely. A demand for speedy trial pursuant to the provisions of this section may not be made until an indictment has been returned or an accusation preferred. State v. Black, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../301/55/index.html">213 Ga. App. 331</a></span>, 332 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../301/55/index.html">444 SE2d 368</a></span>) (1994), rev'd on other grounds in Hurst v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../217/9/index.html">266 Ga. 712 (470 SE2d 659) (1996)</a></span>. To the extent that appellant's contentions raise a constitutional claim, appellant has failed to demonstrate how the 18-month period between his arrest and trial resulted in any impairment of appellant's defense. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 515 (92 SC 2182, 33 LE2d 101) (1972); State v. Auerswald, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../349/00/index.html">198 Ga. App. 183</a></span>, 184 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../349/00/index.html">401 SE2d 27</a></span>) (1990).</div><div class="casepar">2. Next appellant contends that this case should have been dismissed as res judicata because the same issues had allegedly been raised in a prior civil case filed in the Superior Courts of Fayette County, Civil Action No. 91V-0481. Because of the different standards of proof, the "judgment in a civil action is not admissible in a criminal action to prove any fact determined in the civil action." Flynt v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../516/24/index.html">153 Ga. App. 232</a></span>, 243 (<span class="casemissing">264 SE2d 669</span>) (1980). Further, no final judgment in the prior civil case was introduced, thereby precluding the application of the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppel under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/12/40/index.html">9-12-40</a></span>. Quinn v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../278/14/index.html">221 Ga. App. 399 (471 SE2d 337) (1996)</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span></div><div class="casepar">3. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to allow the appellant, following the guilty verdict, to "poll" the jury by asking them: (1) if they had "made a decision [based] on the Carter -- Walden fued [sic] going on in local papers for about 7 years"; and (2) if they "felt sorry for Lester Walden and did not go by evidence presented to them." A defendant's right to poll a jury following the verdict does not encompass questioning which attempts to impeach the verdict. See, e.g., OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/9/41/index.html">17-9-41</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. Next appellant contends that he was hampered in presenting his defense because he was intimidated by the trial court. We have reviewed the record in the instant case. The only factor that could possibly be considered "intimidating" was the trial court's appropriate attempts to require appellant to comply with rules of evidence and procedure, which task appellant willingly undertook when he decided to represent himself. Further, if appellant was "intimidated" by the trial court, such was not apparent by his conduct during the presentation of his defense, and appellant has failed to show any harm resulting from his alleged "intimidation." "Both error and harm must be shown affirmatively by the record to authorize a reversal on appeal. [Cit.]" Robinson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../305/75/index.html">212 Ga. App. 613</a></span>, 616 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../305/75/index.html">442 SE2d 901</a></span>) (1994).</div><div class="casepar">5. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for directed verdict. The state introduced numerous pictures taken by Walden which showed appellant using a tractor to push dirt and debris up against the combination of hog wire and chain link fence that separated their common boundary line. In addition, Lester Walden testified that he had his property surveyed three times, and that the fence was on his property; that appellant, without consent, continually piled dirt up to and over the fence, which caused damage to the fence and the property on the other side; and that appellant's acts were in retaliation for other benign acts committed by Walden.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant, on the other hand, testified that the fence may have been on the property line originally, but rainwater had pushed the fence over onto his land; that since the fence was on his land, he could rightfully push his own dirt up against his own fence if he chose to do so; and that Walden filed these charges in retaliation for other benign acts committed by appellant.</div><div class="casepar">" 'It is the province of the jury, and theirs alone, when considering conflicting evidence and statements of defendant[], to decide what evidence to believe or disbelieve.' [Cit.]" Crews v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../588/83/index.html">133 Ga. App. 764</a></span>, 765 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../588/83/index.html">213 SE2d 34</a></span>) (1975). Further, "the intent with which an act is done is peculiarly a question of fact for determination by the jury." Brown v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../436/38/index.html">174 Ga. App. 913 (331 SE2d 891) (1985)</a></span>. There was no error.</div><div class="casepar">6. Appellant next contends that the deputy who investigated Walden's complaint and the magistrate who issued the arrest warrant "were bias [sic] and lied in Court," because both allegedly testified that Walden's allegations against appellant were investigated before appellant's arrest. Appellant contends that "Court Records show incident was investigated 30 days after arrest. Court records were falsified by adding a date to original Sept. Stamp." It appears to this Court that the date on which Walden's allegations were "investigated" does not impact on the validity of the investigation. Nor does it impact on the jury's credibility determination regarding the "swearing contest" of conflicting testimony presented by appellant and Walden as to the essential elements of the crime for which appellant was convicted. However, that aside, appellant has made no effort to identify the allegedly biased and false testimony of the deputy and the magistrate by page reference to the transcript; he has not identified on what basis he claims court records were falsified; he presents no legal argument other than bare contentions; and he presents no relevant citations of authority. This claim of error is abandoned. Court of Appeals Rule 27 (c) (2) and (3) (i); Elrod v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../361/70/index.html">195 Ga. App. 571 (394 SE2d 548) (1990)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">7. Contrary to appellant's claim of error, the failure to establish the exact value of the damage done to Walden's property and the trial court's failure to order restitution were not cause for a new trial. The evidence established the essential elements of the offense. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/7/21/index.html">16-7-21</a></span> (a); Matthews v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../269/51/index.html">224 Ga. App. 407 (481 SE2d 235) (1997)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">8. Appellant claims as error the trial court's failure to charge the jury that the exact amount of damage must be determined. As appellant failed to reserve objections to the jury charge, we will not consider this contention. Sims v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../208/6/index.html">266 Ga. 417</a></span>, 418 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../208/6/index.html">467 SE2d 574</a></span>) (1996).</div><div class="casepar">9. Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a change of venue. Appellant failed to raise this issue at trial. (Further, appellant, again, offers no argument in support of a change of venue, cites no relevant authority in support thereof, and asserts only bare contentions.) "Failure to object in the trial court leaves nothing for this court to review on appeal. [Cits.]" (Punctuation omitted.) James v. Tyler, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../295/86/index.html">215 Ga. App. 479</a></span>, 480 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../295/86/index.html">451 SE2d 506</a></span>) (1994). Therefore, appellant failed to preserve this issue for consideration by this Court.</div><div class="casepar">10. Appellant was sentenced to twelve months, six months to serve and six months probated, with a $1,000 fine. Such sentence was within the statutory limits provided for misdemeanor punishment, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/3/index.html">17-10-3</a></span> (a), and appellant's complaint that the "punishment does not fit the crime" is meritless.</div><div class="casepar">11. Appellant correctly claims that there is a fundamental right to a free transcript on appeal -- for an indigent defendant. Stalling v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../123/81/index.html">231 Ga. 37 (200 SE2d 121) (1973)</a></span>; Hall v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../482/45/index.html">162 Ga. App. 713 (293 SE2d 862) (1982)</a></span>. Appellant has not claimed that he is indigent, and the evidence shows that appellant is not indigent. Thus, contrary to his contentions, appellant is not entitled to a free transcript. Further, appellant was tried on February 25, 1997; he was sentenced on February 28, 1997; his motion for new trial was denied on March 28, 1997; a notice of appeal was filed on March 31, 1997; and a transcript of the proceedings was filed on May 14, 1997. There was no error pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/5/index.html">17-8-5</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">12. A February 25, 1997 prosecution for a crime that was alleged to occur seventeen months before, on August 9, 1995, is not barred by the two-year (twenty-four months) statute of limitation for the prosecution of misdemeanor cases. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/3/1/index.html">17-3-1</a></span> (d).</div><div class="casepar">Case No. A98A0073: Criminal Contempt</div><div class="casepar">Appellant's sole contention with regard to his conviction for criminal contempt of court is that he was not in contempt. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> Appellant claims that his conduct was not "intentional, wilful, or done to degrade"; appellant urges that he engaged in unseemly conduct because "I needed a recess to get my thoughts straight. I could not understand instructions from the court." We find such contentions to be incredible. A review of the transcript shows that the trial court did everything in its power, short of contempt, to compel the appellant to behave. The characterization "soul of patience" comes to mind. Direct requests by the trial court, which were comprised of nothing more complicated than "don't say that again," were ignored by appellant; the trial court warned the appellant that he was in danger of being held in contempt. Appellant's actions in court appeared retaliatory toward Walden for filing the charges against him and contemptuous of the trial court's efforts to conduct the trial in a fair and orderly manner. We find under the circumstances that sufficient evidence exists from which to find appellant guilty of criminal contempt of court beyond a reasonable doubt. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/1/4/index.html">15-1-4</a></span>; In re Irvin, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../588/1/index.html">254 Ga. 251 (328 SE2d 215) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Steven L.
