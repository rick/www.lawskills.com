Before Judge Jenrette.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">After appellees Joann Peaks and Eric Jackson filed their complaint for false imprisonment, false arrest, slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium, and bad faith against Drug Emporium, Inc. and Super Discount Markets d/b/a Cub Foods and both defendants were served with the summons and complaint, appellant Drug Emporium did not file a timely answer. Defendant Super Discount Markets filed its answer, but appellees dismissed the complaint against Super Discount Markets. On December 29, 1995, default judgment was entered against appellant.</div><div class="casepar">Appellees pled in some 46 paragraphs the averred facts that set forth two theories of recovery that were ultimately presented to the jury: (1) false imprisonment; and (2) false arrest. Such averments set forth that Mary Wilson attempted to pass a forged check with appellant but that it was detected as being forged; Wilson disappeared from the store, and appellant's employees began a search including going next door to Cub Foods where they incorrectly identified Peaks, had the Atlanta Police Department called, had Cub Foods security detain Peaks and her husband, had them taken to appellant's store by the police, had them identified incorrectly by its store employees, and caused Peaks to be arrested for forgery which caused her to be held for 14 hours in custody. The complaint also pled that Wilson was arrested and confessed which led to the release of Peaks.</div><div class="casepar">The complaint also averred that appellant's employees did not merely report the felony but searched the premises of Cub Foods, twice falsely identified Peaks as the perpetrator, caused others to detain not only Peaks but also her husband, Jackson, and then had them taken to the manager's office of appellant where they were detained while a second identification was made and a discussion took place about the arrest of Peaks. The complaint alleged that appellant "acted in bad faith, ha[s] been stubbornly litigious, and/or ha[s] caused plaintiffs unnecessary trouble and expense." The complaint prayed "that plaintiff Joann Peaks be awarded punitive damages as a result of defendant Super Discount Market, Inc.'s wilful or grossly negligent conduct, which indicated a wanton disregard for the rights of plaintiff, in an amount not less than $500,000; that plaintiff Eric Jackson be awarded punitive damages as a result of defendant Super Discount Market, Inc.'s wilful or grossly negligent conduct, which indicated a wanton disregard for the rights of plaintiff, in an amount not less than $250,000; that plaintiff Joann Peaks be awarded punitive damages as a result of defendant Drug Emporium, Inc.'s wilful or grossly negligent conduct, which indicated a wanton disregard for the rights of plaintiff, in an amount not less than $500,000."</div><div class="casepar">The complaint alleged inter alia that the arrest of the plaintiffs was instigated and effectuated at the direction of employees of Drug Emporium, Inc. The body of the complaint, however, does not aver that the facts averred constitute aggravated circumstances authorizing the imposition of punitive damages under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b); that is, it is not averred in the body of the complaint that the facts alleged constituted "willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences."</div><div class="casepar">On January 10, 1996, appellant filed its answer and moved to open the default. Attached to the motion to open default was the affidavit of Monique Jobs. The affidavit stated that she was the employee of C T Corporation Systems ("C T") whose job it was to receive service; that C T was the agent for service of appellant; that service was made on September 5, 1995; that she had the complaint and summons delivered by Federal Express to appellant at 155 Hidden Ravine Drive, Powell, Ohio 43065; that a receipt from appellant was returned to C T on September 7, 1995; and that C T did not notify local counsel for appellant or appellant's insurance carrier. The affidavit of Donna Talley, assistant to the vice-president of appellant, stated that the complaint was received from C T; that it was facsimiled to Daniel James Insurance Agency, Inc., Toledo, Ohio, general agent for its liability carrier General Insurance; that C T forwarded various other pleadings over the next several months; that on January 3, 1996, a default judgment was received; and that until the default judgment was received, it did not know that no answer had been filed. The affidavit of Patricia K. Page, senior claims representative for Daniel James Insurance Agency, Inc., indicated that she received the facsimile but she does not have any transmission report to the Atlanta office of General Insurance. The affidavit of Neita Conley, claims supervisor for General Insurance, states that it never received notice of the suit from its agent.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court heard the motion to open default on February 29, 1996. On June 11, 1996, the motion to open default was denied.</div><div class="casepar">The suit came to jury trial on the issue of damages on June 11, 1996; a verdict was returned on June 14, 1996; and a judgment was entered on July 2, 1996, in the amount of $4,000 for necessary expenses, $82,000 for pain and suffering, $7,500 for loss of consortium, and $150,000 for punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">Although appellant filed its motion for new trial after oral argument on the motion, the trial court denied appellant's new trial motion. Thereafter, appellant timely filed its notice of appeal. Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. Appellant's first enumeration of error is that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to open default.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant admitted receipt of the summons and complaint on September 5, 1995. Appellant then waited 117 days until after a default judgment was entered against it, before filing its motion to open the default under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/55/index.html">9-11-55</a></span>. After the initial service, C T received additional subsequent pleadings for appellant, which were passed on to appellant and which appellant placed in its files without further inquiry as to the suit until it received the default judgment.</div><div class="casepar">Where a defendant has been properly served and relies upon the insurer, the insurance agent, or counsel to file an answer timely, the failure of the defendant's agent, counsel, or insurer is imputable to the defendant in determining the presence or absence of excusable neglect. See Pulliam v. Nichols, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../335/94/index.html">202 Ga. App. 95 (413 SE2d 215)</a></span>; U. S. Xpress v. W. Timothy Askew &amp; Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../366/37/index.html">194 Ga. App. 730 (391 SE2d 707)</a></span>. Excusable neglect means a reasonable excuse or justification for failure to answer timely; it is " ' "that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances." ' " (Citations omitted.) Ezzard v. Morgan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../632/05/index.html">118 Ga. App. 50</a></span>, 53 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../632/05/index.html">162 SE2d 793</a></span>); see Security Mgmt. Co. v. Keasler, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../593/20/index.html">131 Ga. App. 230 (205 SE2d 515)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The failure of the insurance agent to deliver the summons and complaint to the insurer and the failure of the defendant to check timely on the suit within the 45 days are omissions which the trial court, in its discretion, can find do not constitute "excusable neglect." Conversely, the trial court in its discretion could have found that the case sub judice was an "appropriate case" to open default, but it did not.</div><div class="casepar">The affidavit of the claims agent stated conclusions, not facts, upon which the trial judge could exercise sound discretion; the affidavit failed to set forth a " 'good and meritorious defense.' " Coleman v. Dairyland Ins. Co., <span class="casemissing">130 Ga. App. 228</span>, 229 (<span class="casemissing">202 SE2d 698</span>); see also Town of Thunderbolt v. River Crossing Apts., Ltd., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../383/67/index.html">189 Ga. App. 607 (377 SE2d 12)</a></span>. Where the conditions precedent to the opening of default have not been met, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to open the default. See Taurus Productions v. Maryland Sound Indus., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../507/68/index.html">155 Ga. App. 147 (270 SE2d 337)</a></span>; B-X Corp. v. Fulton Plumbing Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../563/46/index.html">140 Ga. App. 131 (230 SE2d 331)</a></span>; Ga. Hwy. Express Co. v. Do-All Chem. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../634/74/index.html">118 Ga. App. 736 (165 SE2d 429)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The role of the appellate court in reviewing a grant or denial of a motion to open default is the determination of whether all the conditions have been met and, if so, whether the trial court abused its discretion under the facts and circumstances. Majestic Homes v. Sierra Dev. Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/35/index.html">211 Ga. App. 223 (438 SE2d 686)</a></span>. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to open the default judgment in the case sub judice.</div><div class="casepar">2. Although the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Drug Emporium's motion to open the default, this case is so procedurally and substantively defective that the judgment of the trial court awarding punitive damages cannot be affirmed. We cannot affirm an award of punitive damages in which the trial court declined to follow the procedures and standards now required by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>, awarded punitive damages against appellant Drug Emporium to a party who did not pray for them, and charged the jury based on an outdated punitive damage Code section.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Prejudicial error occurred in this case by the giving of an outdated charge on punitive damages consistent with the provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5/index.html">51-12-5</a></span>. In charging the jury regarding the basis for an award of punitive damages, the court stated that "the jury may give additional damages either to deter the wrongdoer from repeating the trespass or as compensation for the wounded feelings of the plaintiffs." (Emphasis supplied.) While this is an accurate statement of the former law, see OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5/index.html">51-12-5</a></span>, the current punitive damages statute, applicable to this case, expressly does not allow punitive damages as compensation for wounded feelings or otherwise, but solely to "punish, penalize, or deter a defendant." OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (c). Thus, the trial court's charge plainly was incorrect. The only issues remaining, regarding this matter, are whether appellant properly excepted to the charge and whether the error was harmless.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant expressly objected to the trial court's charge on punitive damages on the ground that the punitive damages statute had been changed. Appellant's attorney specifically referred to the new statute, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>, and stated that he had believed the court would charge portions of the new statute. The trial court responded: "I would have charged [the new statute] but [the plaintiff] wanted to insist on his position on the request he made. I gave it the way he wanted it." Appellant's exception clearly was sufficient to bring the issue to the trial court's attention and preserve the issue for appeal. Appellant's third enumeration of error on its face unequivocally is broad enough to assert this error to this Court. While appellant's argument of this issue is not so apparent in its appellate brief, when viewed in its totality, we find that the argument advanced, although not a model to be followed, did suffice to prevent this issue from being abandoned.</div><div class="casepar">In Foskey v. Foskey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/3/index.html">257 Ga. 736</a></span>, 737 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/3/index.html">363 SE2d 547</a></span>), our Supreme Court listed four types of erroneous jury charges as to which reversal will occur though no exception thereto was taken. Among those erroneous charges are those which are of a kind likely to influence a jury either to find against a defendant or to return a larger verdict than it might have otherwise done and those which are blatantly apparent and prejudicial to the extent the erroneous charge raises the question of whether the losing party has to some extent at least been deprived of a fair trial because of it. The erroneous charge here at issue was of a kind likely to influence a jury to find an award in favor of plaintiffs merely to compensate for their wounded feelings and also is so blatantly in error as to raise the question whether, as to at least the award of punitive damages, appellant was deprived of a fair trial because of the erroneous charge. Thus, on either of these two Foskey grounds, the charge here at issue constituted plain error within the meaning of Lynd, supra, and the error is preserved for appellant's consideration and correction.</div><div class="casepar">The correct legal basis (as distinguished from the correct legal standard -- an issue discussed in subsequent subdivisions in this opinion), which would support an award of punitive damages by the jury, was a substantial issue in these proceedings. It is beyond dispute that " 'the trial court has a duty, even in the absence of a request, to charge the jury the law as to every substantial and vital issue in the case. . . .' [Cit.]" Agnew v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../189/6/index.html">267 Ga. 589</a></span>, 591 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../189/6/index.html">481 SE2d 516</a></span>). Notwithstanding speculation unsupported by the record regarding the effect of this error, it cannot be said this critical charging error was harmless, as the erroneous charge (purporting to address the proper legal basis for an award of punitive damages) erroneously allowed the jury to award punitive damages merely for the wounded feelings of the plaintiffs. It also did not address the correct legal basis supporting an award and inform them that punitive damages no longer could be awarded as compensation. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (c). Moreover, as held by Foskey, supra at 737 (2), " ' "[w]hen an error in the charge of the court is shown to exist, it is presumed to be prejudicial and harmful, and this court will so hold unless it appears from the entire record[, which as to this error it does not,] that the error is harmless." ' " (Citations omitted.) Based on this error alone, reversal of the punitive damage award is required.</div><div class="casepar">(b) Secondly, although not enumerated as error or argued in Drug Emporium's appellate brief, appellee Jackson is not entitled to punitive damages because the complaint's prayer for relief contains no specific prayer for punitive damages (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) (1)) on his behalf from Drug Emporium. Instead, his prayer for relief sought punitive damages only from a co-defendant who was dismissed from the case after Drug Emporium's default. Therefore, he failed to meet the requirement of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) that his complaint specifically pray for punitive damages. This error is subject to appellate review for the reasons stated in Division 1, supra. Lynd, supra; Foskey, supra; Kearney, supra.</div><div class="casepar">This error was not cured by the charge to the jury. At various times the charge discussed punitive damage awards to both appellees/plaintiffs for false arrest or false imprisonment but, at a later point, instructed the jury that appellee Jackson's only claim was for loss of consortium. Because the charge to the jury was so misleading as to create a fair risk the jury would conclude that punitive damages could be awarded to both plaintiffs against Drug Emporium, because the verdict form was so ambiguous as to allow a lump sum award of punitive damages to both plaintiffs, and because the verdict and judgment on their face awarded punitive damages to both plaintiffs jointly, we cannot sever the punitive damages awarded Jackson from the punitive damages awarded Peaks. Therefore, the verdict and judgment are tainted and the judgment on punitive damages must be reversed. Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Gay, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/07/index.html">214 Ga. 2</a></span>, 3 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../173/07/index.html">102 SE2d 492</a></span>); Eastern Foods v. Foreman, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/56/index.html">202 Ga. App. 347</a></span>, 348 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../336/56/index.html">415 SE2d 1</a></span>). Compare Mock v. Wrigley, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../421/77/index.html">178 Ga. App. 660</a></span>, 661 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../421/77/index.html">344 SE2d 482</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">(c) In asserting that prejudicial error did not occur regarding the award of punitive damages, appellees rely substantially on the precedent of this Court in Hill v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/78/index.html">210 Ga. App. 824 (437 SE2d 801)</a></span>. However, Hill is distinguishable. Of particular significance is that in Hill, unlike the case before us, Johnson included in his complaint a separate count for punitive damages expressly averring that 'such actions merit the award of punitive damages to plaintiff under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>.' " Id. at 824, 825.

(The record does not reveal how or why the other allegations against Drug Emporium were removed from the jury's consideration.) Therefore, it is wrong to conclude that punitive damages were authorized on one basis and then decide the amount of punitive damages to be awarded on another basis. This is particularly true when the allegations submitted to the jury regarding false imprisonment and false arrest do not allege facts sufficient to state a claim authorizing the award of punitive damages based only upon Drug Emporium's default.</div><div class="casepar">See Williams v. Smith, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../419/01/index.html">179 Ga. App. 712</a></span>, 713-714 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../419/01/index.html">348 SE2d 50</a></span>): The only essential elements in an action to recover damages for illegal arrest or false imprisonment are the arrest or detention and the unlawfulness thereof. Malice and lack of probable cause need not be shown. Adams &amp; Adams, Ga. Law of Torts (1996 ed.)  29-4, False Imprisonment &amp; False Arrest, p. 498: "Some cases have confused the tort of false arrest with that of malicious arrest, but malicious arrest involves the initiation of criminal proceedings." Compare Adams &amp; Adams, supra at  29-5, Malicious Prosecution &amp; Malicious Arrest, pp. 503-504. As no averment asserts that Drug Emporium's employees acted maliciously, the complaint in this case did not allege counts of malicious arrest or malicious prosecution. Further, the trial court clearly interpreted the allegations as constituting false arrest and not malicious arrest because the trial court advised the jury that false arrest and false imprisonment were used interchangeably in the charge.</div><div class="casepar">Hence, the complaint does not authorize an award of punitive damages because there is no specific allegation that Drug Emporium's actions showed wilful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b). Further, nothing in the matters alleged authorized one to infer or conclude as a matter of fact (see Stroud v. Elias, supra at 193) that Drug Emporium's actions rose to that level. The contention that Drug Emporium somehow satisfied the elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is a conclusion of law that is not admitted by a default judgment. Id.</div><div class="casepar">A default judgment only "operates as an admission by the defendant of the truth of the definite and certain allegations and the fair inferences and conclusions of fact to be drawn from the allegations." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Id. at 193 (1). Consequently, even excluding the fact that the trial court submitted the issue of damages solely as to appellees' claims of false arrest and false imprisonment and appellee Jackson's claim of loss of consortium, the default still does not support the award of punitive damages to the appellees. Notwithstanding that Drug Emporium's default admitted each and every material allegation of the complaint except the amount of damages suffered by Peaks (Whitby v. Maloy, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../528/22/index.html">150 Ga. App. 575 (1) (258 SE2d 181)</a></span>), these admissions were not sufficient to authorize a charge on punitive damages because they contained no allegations concerning punitive damages within the meaning of Stroud, supra.</div><div class="casepar">3. Further, the statement in the prayer that appellee Peaks be awarded punitive damages because of Drug Emporium's "wilful or grossly negligent conduct, which indicated a wanton disregard for the rights of plaintiff" is no substitute for an allegation in the complaint seeking punitive damages. Even though "[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally" (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9/index.html">9-11-9</a></span> (b)), because of the present requirement in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> that punitive damages be specifically prayed for in the complaint, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/9/11/9/index.html">9-11-9</a></span> (b) is no longer applicable in punitive damages cases. Otherwise the requirement in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) requiring that an award be specifically prayed for has no meaning.

Further, because this prayer in this complaint is stated in the alternative, it adds nothing to the complaint as gross negligence alone will not support an award of punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">In another context, to state specifically special damages means that they must be pleaded with particularity. Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Conway, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../609/64/index.html">126 Ga.

The same rule applies when praying for punitive damages. Therefore, in this case, the default, standing alone, was not sufficient to support a determination that Drug Emporium was liable for punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">4. Moreover, we reject the contention that appellant's mere failure to move for a directed verdict or to strike the evidence, based upon a failure to prove aggravating circumstances by "clear and convincing evidence," constituted an express waiver of this higher statutory standard of proof. Contrary to any implicit contention, Hill, supra, did not address this particular issue and did not so affirmatively hold. Likewise, the case of Floyd v. First Union Nat. Bank &amp;c., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../335/21/index.html">203 Ga. App. 788 (417 SE2d 725)</a></span> did not consider the appellate issues here under contention. Rather, one of the major issues addressed in Floyd was the effect of a default judgment on an averment by plaintiffs which demanded judgment as to both claims for punitive damages and attorney fees" 'in an amount to be determined at trial' rather than in a specific dollar amount." Id. at 788 (1).

Appellant took exception to the giving of both appellees' Requests to Charge Nos. 4 and 5 and to the charging remarks given by the trial court immediately following the giving of appellees/plaintiffs' Request to Charge No. 5.

After reemphasizing the element of "an entire want of care and indifference to the consequences [by the defendants]," the trial court gratuitously stated: "Those are the circumstances in which punitive damages would be allowed in this case, or I should say substantially punitive damages would be allowed. They would be entitled to at least nominal damages." (Emphasis supplied.) This latter instruction on its face is both confusing and misleading, and a fair risk exists that the jury would interpret it as mandating them to return an award of punitive damages at least in some nominal amount.

Thus, the language requiring punitive damages to be specifically prayed for in the complaint, as used under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) (1), means that a request for punitive damages must be set forth in the prayer for relief, with which requirement appellee fully complied.</div><div class="casepar">In a default judgment, the aggravating factors under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b) have been deemed admitted; therefore, it is for the trier of fact, the jury in the case sub judice, to determine specifically if such damages are appropriate and to decide within the limits of the act how much to award. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) (2); see generally Hill v. Johnson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/78/index.html">210 Ga. App. 824</a></span>, 825 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../312/78/index.html">437 SE2d 801</a></span>) (1993); see also Chrysler Credit Corp. v.

After appellees presented evidence, appellant did not move for directed verdict or to strike the evidence based upon a failure to prove the aggravating circumstances by "clear and convincing evidence" under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b). Thus, appellant waived such higher standard of proof. Hill v. Johnson, supra at 825; see also Shaw v. Ruiz, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/20/index.html">207 Ga. App. 299</a></span>, 300-301 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../320/20/index.html">428 SE2d 98</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">Unlike Clarke v. Cotton, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../317/3/index.html">263 Ga. 861 (440 SE2d 165) (1994)</a></span>, a case upon which appellant relies, appellant failed to object and to request that the jury be charged that the burden of proof is by clear and convincing evidence and that such standard be defined. Under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b), the "clear and convincing evidence" standard applies to proof that the "defendant's actions showed willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences."</div><div class="casepar">"[W]e pointed out that, in Georgia, the purpose of punitive damages is to deter the repetition of reprehensible conduct by the defendant. OCGA  [<span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>]. Because deterrence is based on factors other than the actual harm caused, we rejected the notion that punitive damages must necessarily bear some relationship to the actual damages awarded by the jury. . . . The purpose of punitive damages, after all, is to deter such conduct. . . . Society's interest would seem better served by deterring objectionable conduct at the first opportunity so that the potentially greater injury which might otherwise be caused by such conduct might be avoided."

Under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (c), the statutory purpose is to "punish, penalize, or deter." Banks v.

Green, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/2/index.html">263 Ga. 470</a></span>, 472 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../304/2/index.html">435 SE2d 205</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">"Something more than the mere commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages. There must be circumstances of aggravation or outrage, such as spite or malice, or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that the conduct may be called wilful or wanton. There is general agreement that, because it lacks this element, mere negligence is not enough, even though it is so extreme in degree as to be characterized as gross. Still less, of course, can such damages be charged against one who acts under an innocent mistake in engaging in conduct that nevertheless constitutes a tort." (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Banks v. ICI Americas, supra at 610 (3), quoting Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Brown, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../465/0/index.html">258 Ga. 115</a></span>, 121-122 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../465/0/index.html">365 SE2d 827</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">When a party is in default on an intentional tort which falls within the ambit of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b), the elements of punitive damages that must be proven by "clear and convincing evidence" are deemed admitted. However, the trier of fact still must make a specific determination from such admitted facts and circumstances as to whether or not punitive damages are appropriate. See Hill v. Johnson, supra at 824-825; Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Brown, supra at 656-657. In the case sub judice, the jury, by their action in separately filling out the space on the verdict form for punitive damages and inserting a specific award for punitive damages, made a specific finding thereby that "an award of punitive damages shall be made"; the jury's actions satisfied OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (d) (1). Appellant failed to object at any time to such procedure or verdict form and waived any issue as to a procedure created for the defendant's protection. See Hill v. Johnson, supra at 825; Shaw v. Ruiz, supra at 300-301.</div><div class="casepar">The admitted facts of the complaint showed "[t]here was no harm with regard to punitive damages against [appellant] because the overwhelming [admissions in the default] showed a 'conscious indifference to consequences' on [its] part, more than meeting the clear and convincing standard of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> (b)." Clarke v. Cotton, supra at 862.</div><div class="casepar">The provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> set forth specific procedural requirements, i.e., that the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence; that there must be a specific finding by the trier of fact of aggravating circumstances such as to warrant the imposition of punitive damages; and that there must be a bifurcation of the trial, with the trier of fact making findings of liability and as to some damages, prior to hearing evidence in aggravation. Such procedures are for the protection of the defendant and can be waived. However, nowhere in the record, either prior to the jury receiving the case or after the verdict was received but before the jury was dispersed, did counsel for appellant make any objection or motion before the trial court raising the issue of failure to follow the procedures of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>. This enumeration of error was not raised at the trial and passed upon by the trial court in order to preserve it for appellate review. Thus, such issue was raised for the first time on appeal and is not appropriate for appellate review by this Court. Such issue is waived by failure to timely object. See Hill v. Johnson, supra at 825.</div><div class="casepar">2. Appellant submitted no written request to charge on OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span>. The trial court gave appellees' Request to Charge No. 5, which embodied OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5/index.html">51-12-5</a></span> and which deviated from the principles of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> in stating that punitive damages are both to compensate for wounded feelings, as well as to deter the wrongdoer. The rest of the charge included language present in both statutes.</div><div class="casepar">"Assuming without deciding that it is always error for the trial court not to comply exactly with the requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/51/12/5.1/index.html">51-12-5.1</a></span> in a default judgment action ([cit.]), we find the failure to do so in this case was harmless error." Hill v. Johnson, supra at 825. Appellant failed to show that the charge was harmful or to properly except to the charge as given so that the trial court could timely correct any harmful error. See Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/80/index.html">148 Ga. App. 702</a></span>, 703 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/80/index.html">252 SE2d 205</a></span>) (1979); see also Smaha v. Moore, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../367/25/index.html">193 Ga. App. 23 (387 SE2d 13) (1989)</a></span>; Stone v. Burell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../485/16/index.html">161 Ga. App. 369 (2) (288 SE2d 636) (1982)</a></span>. The jury returned compensatory damages of $4,000 for expenses of litigation, $82,000 for pain and suffering, and $7,500 for loss of consortium, which fully compensated appellees' general and special damages; however, the jury returned more than one and one-half times that amount, $150,000, as additional damages to punish the appellant. There is nothing to indicate that the jury gave any of the punitive damages as compensation. Had the charge been given that punitive damages are to penalize, to punish, and to deter the wrongdoer from repeating the wrongful conduct in the future, the outcome would have been the same. Obviously the jury was outraged at the appellant's conduct and lack of contrition.</div><div class="casepar">3. Appellant's exception to Request to Charge No. 4 is based upon possible confusion to the jury with regard to pain and suffering and for loss of capacity to labor and earn money. However, the charge was a correct statement of the law. See Williams v. Vinson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../674/11/index.html">104 Ga. App. 886</a></span>, 892-893 (6) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../674/11/index.html">123 SE2d 281</a></span>) (1961); Langran v. Hodges, <span class="casemissing">60 Ga. App. 567</span>, 569-571 (3) (<span class="casemissing">4 SE2d 489</span>) (1939).</div><div class="casepar">For reversal of a case based upon a jury charge or failure to charge, there must be a showing of harmful error, which causes such gross injustice that the question of whether the party has been deprived of a fair trial can fairly be raised. See Greenhill v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/58/index.html">199 Ga. App. 218</a></span>, 222 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../345/58/index.html">404 SE2d 577</a></span>) (1991); Wisenbaker v. Warren, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../357/96/index.html">196 Ga.

App. 67</a></span>, 68 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../430/30/index.html">332 SE2d 367</a></span>) (1985).</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, appellant's exception to the charge did not set forth harmful error so that the trial court could correct any alleged error. The exception was so vague, indefinite, and lacking in specificity that it failed to point out any alleged error. Therefore, the exception was deficient. See Smaha v. Moore, supra; Stone v. Burell, supra; McGaha v. Kwon, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../484/45/index.html">161 Ga. App. 216 (288 SE2d 289) (1982)</a></span>; Jackson v.
