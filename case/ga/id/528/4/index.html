DeKalb Superior Court. Before Judge Weeks.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The appellant, Charles Marion Pullin, and two others, were indicted for the offense of the malice murder of Carlos "Scooter" Johnson, or, in the alternative, the felony murder of the victim, on the ground that the homicide occurred while the co-indictees were in the commission of the offense of aggravated assault. The appellant was convicted of felony murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appeals. We affirm. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Construed in a light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence at trial showed the following:</div><div class="casepar">The victim and a group of companions, including Tracy Allen, were playing football on the day of the victim's death, which was October 20, 1986. Afterward, the victim stated that he wished to get a necklace from his girl friend at Glen Point Apartments, which are located in Decatur, Georgia. When they arrived, "three guys" -- identified as the appellant, Rochelle Johnson, and Johnnie Tatem -- were at the apartment.</div><div class="casepar">Words were exchanged between the two groups. The appellant repaired to the vehicle he was operating and retrieved a .32-caliber pistol. The pistol was waved, rocks were thrown, and the appellant was hit in the head by a beer bottle thrown by Tracy Allen.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant and his companions then drove off. They went to Rochelle Johnson's house, took possession of a .22-caliber rifle, and returned to the apartments. They caught sight of the other group of boys running away from the scene. The appellant loaded and fired the rifle, discharging it one time with the bullet striking the victim in his chest. Although there was testimony on the part of the defense that the group of boys was charging at the car when the gun was fired, forensic evidence revealed no gunpowder residue on the victim.</div><div class="casepar">The appellant and his companions departed the scene of the shooting and stored the murder weapon in the trunk of the car which they were driving, which belonged to Johnnie Tatem.</div><div class="casepar">The victim was in possession of no weapon at the time of the murder. After the victim was shot, Johnson and Tatem were taken into police custody, and they led the police to the murder weapon and to the appellant.</div><div class="casepar">While in custody, the appellant gave a statement to police, which was admitted in evidence at trial, to the effect that he returned to the victim's girl friend's apartment because he was upset over the manner in which the victim and his companions "did them," and that he never saw any weapons in the possession of the victim or his companions. However, at trial the appellant testified that he thought he saw a weapon in the victim's hands, that he returned to the victim's girl friend's apartment because they wanted to make sure that he was all right, and that he had seen caps being worn by some group of boys, identifying them as members in a local, juvenile gang called, "Down by Law."</div><div class="casepar">In this appeal, the appellant advances five enumerations of error.</div><div class="casepar">1. First, he argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to authorize a verdict of guilty under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">We hold that the evidence summarized earlier in this opinion was sufficient to authorize a rational trier of fact in finding the appellant guilty of the offense of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="casepar">2. Second, the appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to give his request to charge the jury that a killing, done out of fear of an injury being inflicted in a manner which would not be a felony, is manslaughter.</div><div class="casepar">This charge is taken from headnote 10 of Keener v. State, <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. 194 (1855)</span>, in which this Court, speaking through Justice Lumpkin, espoused the following as a correct statement of law under the statutory criminal law then in effect in this state: "If one kills another, under the fears of a reasonable man, that the deceased was manifestly intending to commit a personal injury upon him, amounting to felony, the killing is justifiable homicide; if the prisoner is under similar fears of some injury less than a felony, the offence [sic] is manslaughter, and not murder." The preceding requested charge constitutes an expression of a facet of the concept of justification or self-defense, and this concept is now codified in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/3/21/index.html">16-3-21</a></span> (a) and (b).</div><div class="casepar">Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/3/21/index.html">16-3-21</a></span> (a) provides, "A person is justified in threatening or using force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such threat or force is necessary to defend himself or a third person against such other's imminent use of unlawful force; however, a person is justified in using force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."</div><div class="casepar">Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/3/21/index.html">16-3-21</a></span> (b) provides, "A person is not justified in using force under the circumstances specified in subsection (a) of this Code section if he: (1) Initially provokes the use of force against himself with the intent to use such force as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon the assailant; (2) Is attempting to commit, committing, or fleeing after the commission or attempted commission of a felony; or (3) Was the aggressor or was engaged in a combat by agreement unless he withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to such other person his intent to do so and the other, notwithstanding, continues or threatens to continue the use of unlawful force."</div><div class="casepar">The trial court here gave the jury a full and fair instruction with respect to the foregoing Code sections, and we find no error.</div><div class="casepar">3. In his third enumeration of error, the appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to give the appellant's requested jury charge on the following provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/3/5/index.html">16-3-5</a></span>: "A person shall not be found guilty of a crime if the act or omission to act constituting the crime was induced by a misapprehension of fact which, if true, would have justified the act or omission." The appellant contends that this charge was adjusted to the evidence, specifically the appellant's testimony that he thought he saw a gun in the possession of the victim at the time he shot him.</div><div class="casepar">As held in Ellis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../434/87/index.html">174 Ga. App. 535 (2) (330 SE2d 764) (1985)</a></span>, inasmuch as the appellant's defense was based on justification and self-defense, and inasmuch as the trial court gave a full jury charge with respect thereto, as noted in Div. 1, supra, the appellant was not entitled to a charge on mistake of fact under  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/3/5/index.html">16-3-5</a></span>. Cf. Henderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../561/35/index.html">141 Ga. App. 430 (4) (233 SE2d 505) (1977)</a></span> and cits.</div><div class="casepar">4. In his fourth enumeration, the appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/3/index.html">16-5-3</a></span> (b).</div><div class="casepar">Section <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/3/index.html">16-5-3</a></span> (b) provides, in pertinent part, "A person commits the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner when he causes the death of another human being without any intention to do so, by the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner likely to cause death or great bodily harm."</div><div class="casepar">The appellant argues that the use of excessive force in self-defense constitutes the commission of a "lawful act in an unlawful manner," within the meaning of  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/5/3/index.html">16-5-3</a></span> (b), thereby authorizing the jury to have convicted the appellant of involuntary manslaughter under the foregoing statutory provision. We disagree.</div><div class="casepar">5. In his fifth and final enumeration, the appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing the victim's mother to testify at trial.</div><div class="casepar">This witness essentially testified that she was the mother of the victim, that his nickname was "Scooter," and that he was in fact deceased; she also identified him from a high-school photograph. This testimony is reproduced on approximately one page of the transcript, and the testimony was not objected to by defense counsel.</div><div class="casepar">We find nothing prejudicial in this testimony; in addition, such testimony was admissible to prove the identity of the victim and the element of corpus delicti with respect to the death of the victim. Sizemore v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/5/index.html">251 Ga. 867</a></span>, 868 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../670/5/index.html">310 SE2d 227</a></span>) (1984) and cits. Furthermore, the appellant's failure to object to the introduction of this testimony at trial constitutes a waiver, precluding the appellant from raising the issue on appeal. E.g., Lobdell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../557/6/index.html">256 Ga. 769 (4) (353 SE2d 799) (1987)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Robert E. Wilson, District Attorney, Elisabeth G.

      The crime in this case occurred on October 20, 1986. The trial occurred on January 20, 21, and 27, 1987. The jury returned its verdict of guilty on January 27, and the appellant was sentenced on that date. No motion for new trial was filed, although an extraordinary motion for new trial was filed on June 8, 1987. An out-of-time appeal was granted, and the notice of appeal was filed on July 15, 1987.
