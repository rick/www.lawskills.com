Thomas Superior Court. Before Judge Lilly, Senior Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Michael David Griffin was indicted in 1992 in McIntosh County for the murder of Jenny Rhames. The State did not seek the death penalty. After Griffin's trial ended in a mistrial, he was reindicted for Rhames' murder. The State again declined to seek the death penalty. The trial court denied Griffin's plea of former jeopardy as to the second indictment and Griffin appealed to this Court. While that appeal was pending, Griffin was indicted in Thomas County in a two-count indictment charging Griffin with kidnapping with bodily injury and murder of Rhames. The State announced its intention to seek the death penalty in that case. We granted Griffin's application for interim appeal pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/35.1/index.html">17-10-35.1</a></span>. We hold that the murder count of the Thomas County indictment must be quashed because at the time of his indictment in Thomas County, that county lacked the right to exercise jurisdiction. We uphold the indictment for kidnapping in Thomas County. We further hold that the State may reindict Griffin for the murder of Rhames in Thomas or McIntosh County and may seek to have Griffin sentenced to death.</div><div class="casepar">1. Griffin first contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to quash the Thomas County murder indictment. We agree.</div><div class="casepar">Where two or more courts have concurrent jurisdiction of the same offense, the court which first acquires jurisdiction of the prosecution retains it to the exclusion of others while that case is pending, thereby preempting jurisdiction for all offenses originating in the same course of criminal conduct. See McAuliffe v. Outz, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../566/64/index.html">139 Ga. App. 62</a></span>, 64 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../566/64/index.html">227 SE2d 807</a></span>) (1976); Nobles v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../724/72/index.html">81 Ga. App. 229</a></span>, 230 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../724/72/index.html">58 SE2d 496</a></span>) (1950). McIntosh County held exclusive jurisdiction of the offense at issue when the State indicted Griffin in Thomas County. Therefore, when Griffin was indicted for murder in Thomas County, that County had no authority to exercise jurisdiction, and the murder count of that indictment must be quashed.</div><div class="casepar">Our holding is not affected by the fact that charges currently are pending against Griffin only in Thomas County. The appeal that was pending at the time Griffin was indicted in Thomas County was resolved in Griffin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../264/4/index.html">264 Ga. 232 (443 SE2d 612) (1994)</a></span>, in which we held that the McIntosh County Superior Court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial and that jeopardy did not attach so as to bar a retrial. After this Court remitted the case to the McIntosh County Superior Court, the McIntosh County indictment was dismissed through nolle prosequi. Hence, because McIntosh County Superior Court, the court first acquiring jurisdiction, has voluntarily and legally dismissed the prosecution, the Thomas County Superior Court now has the opportunity to obtain for the first time the right to exercise its jurisdiction as to the murder charge, since an accused has no vested rights to be tried in any particular court. Nobles, supra. However, the Thomas County Superior Court lacked the right to exercise jurisdiction at the time this case began due to the pendency of proceedings on the same offense in McIntosh County. The error of proceeding initially without the right to exercise jurisdiction is not cured by the subsequent dismissal of the McIntosh County case. See 22 CJS 215, Criminal Law,  176 ("jurisdiction of a court depends on the state of facts existing at the time it is invoked"). To permit this action to proceed under the present indictment would erode the protection of criminal defendants from having to defend themselves simultaneously in two State courts for the same alleged offense.</div><div class="casepar">The Thomas County indictment must be quashed for a further reason. The day before Griffin's indictment in Thomas County, Griffin had filed an appeal with this Court of the denial by the McIntosh County Superior Court of his plea of former jeopardy. While that appeal was pending, the State clearly could not continue to prosecute Griffin in McIntosh County. See Chambers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/0/index.html">262 Ga. 200</a></span>, 202 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../326/0/index.html">415 SE2d 643</a></span>) (1992). To do so would deny Griffin protection from being forced to "run the gauntlet" a second time before his claim of double jeopardy could be reviewed. See Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 662 (97 SC 2034, 52 LE2d 651) (1977); Patterson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../752/3/index.html">248 Ga. 875</a></span>, 876 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../752/3/index.html">287 SE2d 7</a></span>) (1982). Prosecutions of the same defendant in different counties of the same state "must be viewed as the acts of a single sovereign under the Double Jeopardy Clause." Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 164, n. 4 (97 SC 2221, 53 LE2d 187) (1977). Therefore, the State as one sovereign may not circumvent the clear rule barring it from proceeding in one county by simply reindicting Griffin in another.</div><div class="casepar">The rule we articulate today imposes no undue burden upon the State. Nothing bars the State from reindicting Griffin for murder in Thomas County or in McIntosh County. If Griffin is reindicted for murder in Thomas County, either party may move to incorporate the pre-trial record accumulated under the present indictment.</div><div class="casepar">2. Under the facts in this case, venue over the murder charge may lie in either Thomas or McIntosh Counties, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/2/2/index.html">17-2-2</a></span>, but venue over the kidnapping charge lies solely in Thomas County. See Potts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/1/index.html">261 Ga. 716</a></span>, 720 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../382/1/index.html">410 SE2d 89</a></span>) (1991); Krist v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/66/index.html">227 Ga. 85 (4) (179 SE2d 56) (1970)</a></span>. Based on these facts, Griffin argues that the State violated the "single prosecution" requirement in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) when it initially brought the murder charge alone in McIntosh County rather than bringing the murder charge together with the kidnapping charge in Thomas County. Hence, Griffin contends that Count Two of the present indictment, charging him with kidnapping with bodily injury, is procedurally barred by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b). We do not agree.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) (formerly Code Ann.  26-506) requires all crimes arising from the same conduct to be prosecuted in a "single prosecution" provided they are in the same jurisdiction and are known to the prosecutor, unless the court in the interest of justice orders separate trials. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> State v. Estevez, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../121/74/index.html">232 Ga. 316</a></span>, 318-319 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../121/74/index.html">206 SE2d 475</a></span>) (1974). OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> expands the proscription of double jeopardy beyond that provided for in the United States and Georgia Constitutions, State v. Estevez, supra, because it "protects a defendant from multiple prosecutions arising from the same conduct in situations where constitutional double jeopardy would not be a defense." McCannon v. State, <span class="casemissing">252 Ga. 515</span>, 516-517 (<span class="casemissing">315 SE2d 413</span>) (1984). We have recognized that OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) embodies the procedural aspect of double jeopardy, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> State v. Estevez, supra, in that it "prevent[s] an accused from being unduly harassed by or threatened by successive criminal prosecutions." Id. at 319.</div><div class="casepar">It is very rare that a situation arises in which venue over a criminal charge can be had in more than one county. Even under such rare circumstances, however, nothing in the plain language of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) and the case law interpreting it <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> requires that prosecution of a "dual venue" criminal charge must occur in that one county where other criminal charges arising out of the same multi-county crime spree must be prosecuted. As recognized in Henderson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/65/index.html">227 Ga. 68</a></span>, 75 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/65/index.html">179 SE2d 76</a></span>) (1970), "the legislature used language in subsection (b) making the prosecution together of multiple charges mandatory where rules relating to venue permit and the crimes are known to the proper prosecuting officer." (Emphasis supplied.) OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) is a "single venue" rule which expanded procedural due process in this state to bar multiple prosecutions only within the same jurisdiction. We will not construe it as an expansion of procedural due process that unduly restricts the State's method of prosecuting multi-county crime sprees involving these rare, "dual venue" crimes.</div><div class="casepar">While the murder charge cannot be brought in both Thomas and McIntosh Counties, see Division 1, supra, insofar as OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) is concerned, the kidnapping charge in Thomas County is not affected by the fact that the State sought to prosecute Griffin on the murder charge initially in McIntosh County because Mcintosh County is a separate jurisdiction. Should the State decide to proceed with the murder charge in Thomas County, there is, statutorily speaking, no procedural double jeopardy bar to Thomas County also prosecuting Griffin for the kidnapping charge, so long as Thomas County comports with the requirement that there be a "single prosecution." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Finally, contrary to Griffin's argument, prosecution of the kidnapping charge in Thomas County does not constitute vindictiveness of any kind. See Potts v. State, supra, 261 Ga. at (1), in which this Court upheld Potts' death sentence in Cobb County for the kidnapping of Michael Priest even though Potts had also been sentenced to death in Forsyth County for Priest's murder. Here, as in Potts, the kidnapping and murder charges are not the "same" for double jeopardy purposes; <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span> hence, absent any unartfulness in the drawing of the McIntosh murder indictment, there is no statutory or constitutional bar to the Thomas County prosecution for the kidnapping of Jenny Rhames.</div><div class="casepar">3. Griffin contends the trial court erred by denying his plea in bar to prevent the State from seeking the death penalty in Thomas County, because the State specifically waived seeking the death penalty for the same murder charged here both in the original prosecution in McIntosh County and upon subsequent reindictment there. This issue is one of first impression. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Double jeopardy precludes the State from seeking the death penalty on retrial if there was insufficient evidence at the original trial to support the aggravating circumstances or if the jury voted to impose a life sentence. Brooks v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../448/9/index.html">259 Ga. 562 (1) (385 SE2d 81) (1989)</a></span>. See Ward v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../998/2/index.html">239 Ga. 205 (5) (236 SE2d 365) (1977)</a></span>. Griffin argues that by failing to introduce aggravating circumstances at the original trial, the State conceded their absence and thus fixed at life imprisonment the maximum sentence which can be imposed on Griffin for the murder of Jenny Rhames. However, we have held that where a death sentence has been reversed and there was no finding of insufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstances, the State may introduce evidence of aggravating circumstances not presented to the first jury. Crawford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../530/8/index.html">256 Ga. 57 (2) (344 SE2d 215) (1986)</a></span>; Spraggins v. State, <span class="casemissing">255 Ga. 195 (336 SE2d 227) (1985)</span>. In keeping with our prior decisions, we decline to hold that the State conceded the absence of any aggravating circumstances by failing to present them as such in the first trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Griffin next argues, relying upon Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21 (I) (94 SC 2098, 40 LE2d 628) (1974), that an inference of vindictiveness is created by the State's conduct in seeking the death penalty after mistrial, reindictment, and appeal of the denial of the plea of former jeopardy. We disagree. In Blackledge, after the defendant successfully appealed his misdemeanor conviction, the prosecutor reindicted him on a felony charge for the same conduct and, as a result,</div><div class="casepar">this Court does not establish that the kidnapping is an included offense as a matter of fact, see Potts v. State, supra, 261 Ga. at (1), and we have recognized that these crimes are not included as a matter of law. Potts v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../942/9/index.html">241 Ga. 67 (11) (243 SE2d 510) (1978)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">the defendant received a harsher sentence than he had originally received. Id. 417 U. S. at 22-23. The U. S. Supreme Court concluded as was done earlier that the opportunity for prosecutorial vindictiveness after a successful appeal is such that due process requires application of a rule <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> creating a rebuttable presumption of vindictiveness when a judge subjects a criminal defendant to greater punishment after a successful appeal. Id. 417 U. S. at 27. In elaborating on the need to employ a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness, the Blackledge court did not focus on the prosecutor's mere motivation to penalize the individual defendant for the inconvenience or embarrassment involved in a second trial, but instead focused on the prosecutor's motivation to discourage other defendants from appealing. Id. 417 U. S. at 27-28. Furthermore, the U. S. Supreme Court stressed that regardless of actual motivation, the fear of vindictiveness spawned by a rule permitting prosecutors to "up the ante" after a successful appeal would chill defendants' exercise of the right to appeal. Id. 417 U. S. at 28.</div><div class="casepar">The reasoning of Blackledge is inapplicable in the context of jury deadlock. Here, as the State points out, what provided the State an opportunity to "up the ante" was not a successful appeal of a conviction, but rather a mistrial. The appeal of the plea of former jeopardy, had it been successful, would have created no opportunity for enhancement of charges or penalty. A mistrial resulting from an inability of a jury to reach a verdict, especially when entered on the trial court's own motion, is not subject to chilling as is the exercise of the right to appeal. Therefore, no presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness arises. See United States v. Whaley, 830 F2d 1469, 1478-1479 (7th Cir. 1987) (courts have consistently held that no realistic likelihood of vindictiveness is found when a jury is deadlocked and both parties agree that a declaration of mistrial is a necessity); United States v. Khan, 787 F2d 28, 33 (1) (2nd Cir. 1986) (addition of charges after mistrial presents no realistic likelihood of vindictiveness and therefore raises no presumption of vindictiveness); United States v. Mays, 738 F2d 1188, 1190 (11th Cir. 1984) (no presumption of vindictiveness when, after mistrial, government allegedly threatened defendant with additional charges if he refused to plead guilty; declaration of mistrial did not result from assertion of protected right and was not reasonably likely to engender a vindictive response); United States v. Ruppel, 724 F2d 507 (5th Cir. 1984) (declined to presume vindictiveness upon increase in charges after hung jury in absence of evidence of actual retaliation).</div><div class="casepar">Although neither the principles of double jeopardy nor a presumption of vindictiveness will bar the State from seeking the death penalty on reindictment, we are unable on the present record to make a determination whether there was actual vindictiveness. Griffin may nevertheless attempt to prove to the trial court that any effort by the State to seek the death penalty following reindictment is motivated by actual vindictiveness. See United States v. Whaley, supra, 830 F2d at 1478-1479; United States v. Mays, supra, 738 F2d at 1190.</div><div class="casepar">4. Griffin also contends that the trial court erred by ruling that evidence of 29 prior difficulties between Griffin and the victim is admissible. Because our holding in Division 1, supra, leaves no murder indictment pending against him and no notice of intent to seek the death penalty, the unified appeal procedure is not presently applicable to this case. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/35.1/index.html">17-10-35.1</a></span> (a).

This Code section has always been construed to bar the subsequent prosecution of crimes which could have been tried in a single court when the officer actually handling the proceedings knew of the crimes but prosecuted less than all of them. Until now, it has not mattered that the officer actually handling the proceedings did not have jurisdiction of all of the crimes. The question was whether he knew of all of the crimes and whether they could be prosecuted in a single court. See Baker v.

Because its decision violates due process, double jeopardy, and fundamental fairness, I dissent to Divisions 2 and 3.</div><div class="casepar">1. The Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process prohibits the state from punishing a defendant for exercising his legal rights. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Relying on the due process clause, the Supreme Court has created a rebuttable presumption of vindictiveness when a trial judge imposes a more severe sentence on a defendant after a successful appeal. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span> A defendant may show vindictive prosecution in two ways: by producing evidence of actual vindictiveness or showing that there is a sufficient likelihood of vindictiveness to justify a presumption. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source11" href="#note11">11</a></span> I would adopt this same analysis in interpreting the Georgia Constitution's due process clause and hold that the state's decision to seek the death penalty in Griffin's retrial presents a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness that the state has failed to rebut.</div><div class="casepar">The totality of the circumstances surrounding the state's decision to seek the death penalty after Griffin's mistrial and appeal demonstrates a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness. In the first trial, the state sought to have Griffin imprisoned for life, but was unable to convince a majority of jurors even to convict Griffin. After reindicting Griffin, the state was met with a plea of former jeopardy, followed by an appeal of its denial. Unlike a routine pretrial motion, this exercise of Griffin's rights introduced considerable delay in the McIntosh County prosecution. Frustrated, the state tried a new approach. Knowing that in McIntosh County it could do nothing until this Court decided the appeal, the state rushed to indict Griffin in a different county. The state began prosecuting Griffin in Thomas County with at least constructive knowledge that to do so during the pendency of the appeal was improper. Moreover, the state added the kidnapping count, perhaps easier to prove than the murder count, and substantially increased the potential penalty by announcing its intent to seek the death penalty.</div><div class="casepar">The timing of the state's change of course heightens the realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. The state determined to seek the death penalty only after Griffin's first trial ended in a hung jury and he appealed the denial of his double jeopardy claim.</div><div class="casepar">[O]nce a trial begins -- and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained -- it is much more likely that the State has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted. Thus, a change in the charging decision made after an initial trial is completed is much more likely to be improperly motivated than is a pretrial decision. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Just as the United States Supreme Court has presumed prosecutorial vindictiveness when the government increases the severity of charges after a conviction and successful appeal, this Court should presume prosecutorial vindictiveness when the state seeks the death penalty following a mistrial and appeal. Under these circumstances, the state's election to seek the enhanced punishment offends due process under the Georgia Constitution.</div><div class="casepar">This conclusion is in accord with the decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri's opinion in Patterson v. Randall. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source13" href="#note13">13</a></span> In that case, the court was confronted with an issue differing from ours only in that the defendant had successfully appealed a conviction and life sentence before a second prosecutor sought the death penalty. The only change between the two trials affecting the penalty sought was that one prosecutor believed in the death penalty and the other did not. The court held that the state's explanation fell short of meeting the burden placed on the state. Because the state failed to meet its burden, the court presumed that the state might be retaliating against the accused. Therefore, the court held that the prosecutor's election to seek the death penalty at the second trial violated due process. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source14" href="#note14">14</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The state's attempt to rebut the inference of vindictiveness -- by stating that the prosecutors in Thomas County simply reviewed the same evidence as the prosecutors in McIntosh County and came to a different conclusion on the appropriate penalty -- is similarly inadequate. The state as a single sovereign may not circumvent the rules of law and principles of fairness by acting in the guise of first one prosecutor and then another. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source15" href="#note15">15</a></span> More important, the state fails to identify any new fact developed prior to Griffin's appeal that justifies increasing the penalty sought. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source16" href="#note16">16</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Because the enhanced punishment here is a death sentence, this case is distinguishable from the federal cases on which the majority relies in rejecting the presumption. First, the possibility of execution may have far greater impact on the exercise of rights than the possibility of a longer prison term or a larger fine. Whereas a defendant may feel minimal pressure to plead guilty and forego a jury trial after a first jury is unable to reach a verdict on lesser charges, a defendant newly confronted with even a remote chance of execution may feel forced to plead guilty and accept a life sentence. Second, the decision to seek the death penalty on retrial lacks the logical underpinnings that may justify the addition of new charges. Based on the learning experience of trying the case once without success, the state might reasonably bring new charges as part of a strategy to present its evidence differently in the second trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source17" href="#note17">17</a></span> In contrast, seeking the death penalty in a second trial for the same crime would not likely contribute to a better presentation of the evidence of that crime. Finally, the state should exercise its discretion to seek the death penalty only in cases in which the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source18" href="#note18">18</a></span> After Griffin's first trial ended with a majority of jurors prepared to acquit him of the murder, the state could not reasonably anticipate lack of residual doubt as to Griffin's guilt on retrial.</div><div class="casepar">Because the state's actions pose a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness and the state has failed to rebut the inference of vindictiveness, the State Constitution's due process clause prohibits it from seeking the death penalty against Griffin on retrial. Therefore, the state should not be able to seek to have Griffin sentenced to death for the murder of Jenny Rhames in any county.</div><div class="casepar">2. The Georgia Criminal Code also bars the kidnapping with bodily injury count of the Thomas County indictment. State law limits multiple prosecutions for crimes arising from the same criminal conduct. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source19" href="#note19">19</a></span> OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) requires the state to bring a single prosecution if "the several crimes [1] arising from the same conduct [2] are known to the proper prosecuting officer at the time of commencing the prosecution and [3] are within the jurisdiction of a single court."</div><div class="casepar">All three prongs of the statute are satisfied here. First, the kidnapping clearly arose out of the same course of conduct as the murder. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source20" href="#note20">20</a></span> The state alleges that both crimes occurred on the same day in the same county involving the same defendant and victim. Second, the kidnapping was known to the proper prosecuting officer -- the McIntosh County district attorney -- at the time of the original indictment. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source21" href="#note21">21</a></span> The parties stipulated that when Griffin was first indicted for murder in McIntosh County, the district attorney knew about the potential kidnapping charge. At oral argument, the state conceded that the prosecutors of the two counties communicated about the potential charges from the outset. Griffin was not indicted for kidnapping, however, because the state chose to indict him in McIntosh County and the prosecutors believed that venue for the kidnapping charge was proper only in Thomas County. Finally, the kidnapping and murder charges were "within the jurisdiction of a single court," specifically the Superior Court of Thomas County. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source22" href="#note22">22</a></span> Therefore, the state waived the kidnapping charge when it chose to prosecute Griffin for murder in McIntosh County.</div><div class="casepar">In reaching its conclusion that Griffin can now be prosecuted for kidnapping, the the majority ignores precedent, plain statutory language, and the purpose of  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b). In Potts v. State, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source23" href="#note23">23</a></span> we addressed whether  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) barred Pott's prosecution for murder in Forsyth County when he had been prosecuted for kidnapping the same victim in Cobb County. We held that</div><div class="casepar">it is undisputed that the murder of Michael Priest took place in Forsyth County and that the kidnapping with bodily injury took place in Cobb County. As a matter of law, the two offenses were not within a single court's jurisdiction, and could not have been tried together. Therefore, we find no procedural bar to the appellant's subsequent prosecution for the murder of Michael Priest in Forsyth County. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source24" href="#note24">24</a></span></div><div class="casepar">This holding was predicated on the fact that the crimes could not have been tried within a single court's jurisdiction. Conversely, if the kidnapping and murder could have been tried within a single court's jurisdiction, the second prosecution would have been barred. This case presents that logical extension of Potts. Before indicting Griffin, the state was aware that it could prosecute him for murder and kidnapping in Thomas County, but the state elected not to do so, instead proceeding with the murder charge alone in Mcintosh County. Under the rationale of Potts, the state may not now try Griffin for the kidnapping in Thomas County.</div><div class="casepar">Further, the statutory language completely refutes the majority's interpretation of  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) as creating "a 'single venue' rule . . . bar[ring] multiple prosecutions only within the same jurisdiction." <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source25" href="#note25">25</a></span> In a linguistic sleight of hand, the majority has transformed the third phrase, "within the jurisdiction of a single court," to the phrase "within a single venue." But, as we recognized in Potts, the phrase, "are within the jurisdiction of a single court," includes crimes that occur within different counties or venues so long as those crimes can be tried in a single court of one of those counties or venues. This plain language is consistent with the fundamental notion, which goes unaddressed in the majority opinion, that each county in the state is not a separate sovereign. The state cannot be carved into separate jurisdictions in evaluating a double jeopardy claim for it is the state, as a single sovereign, that the statute prohibits from seeking successive prosecutions. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source26" href="#note26">26</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Finally, this case illustrates the situation that  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) was designed to prevent. As the majority acknowledges,  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span> (b) prevents an accused from being unduly harassed or threatened by successive criminal prosecutions. Although Griffin could have been tried for murder and kidnapping in Thomas County in a single prosecution, the state first tried him for murder in McIntosh County. Because both crimes could have been disposed of in one prosecution, the second prosecution is fundamentally unfair, unnecessary, and "unduly harasses" Griffin. The majority fails to recognize that a defendant suffers the same harassment from unnecessary successive prosecutions whether they are in one venue or in multiple jurisdictions. The majority opinion, instead, treats similarly situated defendants disparately, granting protection to a defendant who fortuitously happens to be charged with committing crimes in one county, and denying it to a defendant charged with committing his crimes in multiple counties.</div><div class="casepar">I am authorized to state that Justice Sears joins in this dissent.</div><div class="casepar">SEARS, Justice, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">Presiding Justice Fletcher presents compelling reasons why the state is barred from trying Griffin for the death penalty and for kidnapping. I, therefore, join his dissent. I write separately to explain an additional reason why the majority errs in holding that the state may now seek the death penalty against Griffin after the state has already tried Griffin for murder.</div><div class="casepar">For the reasons given by Presiding Justice Fletcher, due process bars the state from seeking the death penalty against Griffin. I also conclude that double jeopardy bars the state from seeking the death penalty. In holding that double jeopardy bars a state from seeking the death penalty on a retrial when the first jury had "acquitted" the defendant of the grounds necessary to impose the death penalty, the United States Supreme Court found that the same double jeopardy principles that applied to successive prosecutions for an offense applied to successive prosecutions for the death penalty.</div><div class="casepar">The "embarrassment, expense and ordeal" and the "anxiety and insecurity" faced by a defendant at the penalty phase of a . . . capital murder trial are at least equivalent to that faced by any defendant at the guilt phase of a criminal trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source27" href="#note27">27</a></span></div><div class="casepar">The United States Supreme Court in Bullington was thus effectively equating the death penalty with an offense for double jeopardy purposes.
