He was unable to make bond for 33 days, losing his job as a result. On August 6, 1987, he applied for appointed counsel and the Cobb circuit defender's office determined that he met the eligibility standards and appointed an attorney for him. Defendant never met or talked with this attorney.</div><div class="casepar">When he was released on bond, defendant returned to work, but only part-time work was available. While defendant was incarcerated, he was evicted from his residence and all his belongings placed on the curb, from which most disappeared. He therefore had to expend most of his part-time income for essentials.</div><div class="casepar">Because he now had income, the circuit defender's office determined he no longer met the eligibility standards for appointed counsel, and the attorney assigned was removed by court order of October 27, 1987.</div><div class="casepar">After he was denied an attorney, he went to an attorney listed on the defender's qualified list. He was told a $5,000 retainer was necessary, which he was unable to pay.</div><div class="casepar">At the motions hearing on December 10, 1987, defendant appeared pro se and was asked if he had an attorney. He responded that he was unable to afford one but had gotten a job and could "maybe" afford one later.</div><div class="casepar">At the calendar call on January 18, 1988, defendant advised the court that he had been told he was not eligible for appointed counsel and that he had tried to retain counsel but was financially unable to do so. The court suggested he speak with the prosecutor, after which the case was taken off the calendar to give him an opportunity to get an attorney. On March 1, 1988, defendant again applied for appointed counsel, but was found ineligible by the defender's office. No inquiry was made of him regarding his efforts to retain an attorney and his inability to pay the required retainer.</div><div class="casepar">Defendant appeared at the April calendar call, again without an attorney, although this was not addressed by either defendant or the court.</div><div class="casepar">At the trial of the case on November 1, 1988, defendant appeared without counsel and the issue was not further addressed. He conducted the voir dire himself, asking only minimal questions of a few potential jurors.</div><div class="casepar">After the jury was empaneled and excused for lunch, defendant returned to court with an attorney who advised the court he represented defendant. He had been observing trials and had watched defendant conduct voir dire. At the lunch break, he approached defendant and told him he needed an attorney and he would represent defendant if he gave him a retainer. Defendant gave him a quarter as a retainer, which he then borrowed to make a phone call. The attorney, a member of the bar since 1981, had never tried a criminal case or assisted in trying one. His only civil experience was representing himself when he sued the bar examiners, contending the exam was unfair. Although he had applied to be placed on the circuit defender's list of qualified attorneys, he had not been accepted.</div><div class="casepar">After conviction, trial counsel withdrew on December 30, 1988. On January 20, 1989, an order was entered adjudging defendant an indigent and counsel representing him on appeal was appointed.</div><div class="casepar">New counsel filed a motion for new trial, asserting the general grounds, Stinson v.

This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record.'

Consideration of the remaining enumerations is not necessary in light of the holding in Division 1.</div><div class="casepar">POPE, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">1. I cannot agree with the conclusion that the trial court failed to comply with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/12/4/index.html">17-12-4</a></span> and the implementing rules. Said statute requires all trial courts of the state to provide a procedure for determining a defendant's eligibility for appointed counsel and to ap point counsel in cases where a defendant is determined to be indigent. The record shows the Superior Court of Cobb County does have such a procedure. Rule 29.5 of the Uniform Superior Court Rules requires each superior court to determine income level for eligibility for appointed counsel. The record shows the Superior Court of Cobb County had established such an eligibility scale and that defendant in this case was reviewed on several occasions by the appropriate administrative officer to determine if he met the requirements for appointed counsel. Repeatedly it was determined that defendant's income exceeded the standard.</div><div class="casepar">Rule 29.5 provides the court "may," in special circumstances, appoint counsel even for one who does not otherwise meet the eligibility standard where, inter alia, there is "documented refusal of the case by members of the bar because of financial inability to pay for counsel." The record shows the eligibility rules adopted by Cobb County also provide the public defender "may" accept a client for representation due to "refusal of the case by three members of the private bar." I find no requirement in the statutes or applicable rules that a defendant be advised of this rule permitting, though not requiring, appointment of counsel when the defendant is refused representation by the private bar. Therefore, I cannot concur with the majority opinion that a failure so to advise the defendant that he might otherwise qualify for appointed counsel even if he exceeded the income guidelines constitutes a failure to comply with the applicable statutes or rules.</div><div class="casepar">Nor can I agree that the trial court in this case erred in failing to appoint counsel for defendant under the special circumstances provisions. In this case, at the preliminary motions hearing on December 10, 1987, four months after he was released from jail, defendant reported to the judge he had been rehired to his job and "now I can maybe afford an attorney." The trial judge declined to rule on defendant's motion for a continuance but informed defendant he could have until the scheduled trial date, January 18, 1988, to obtain an attorney and prepare for trial. When the case was called in January defendant explained to the judge that he had not obtained counsel because he first had to purchase new clothes and personal belongings to replace those stolen when he was evicted from his apartment while in jail and had talked to several attorneys who required payment of between $2,500 and $5,000 to take his case, which defendant could not afford. Although the State announced ready, the record shows the case was again continued. Again defendant applied to the public defender's office for counsel and again he was found to be ineligible. The case was not reached for trial until November 1, 1988, over one year from defendant's release from jail during which time defendant was employed and earning income in excess of the indigent defense guidelines for the county. Defendant announced ready to commence the trial.</div><div class="casepar">At the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial defendant admitted he was granted several continuances to afford him the opportunity to obtain counsel but defendant held to the belief that the case might be dismissed for lack of evidence. The record shows the trial court heard the evidence which arguably supports defendant's claim for appointed counsel under the special circumstances provision of the rules and nevertheless, in its discretion, denied defendant's request for appointed counsel. Thus, I cannot agree with the conclusion of the majority that defendant's "special circumstances" were not appropriately considered. In my opinion, neither the evidence presented prior to trial nor the evidence presented at the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial requires the trial court, as a matter of law, to appoint counsel to defendant under the "special circumstances" provision of the rules for determining eligibility for appointed counsel. Both Rule 29.5 and the guidelines adopted by Cobb County leave the decision to appoint counsel under special circumstances to the discretion of the trial court. A decision left to the discretion of the trial court will not be overturned on appellate review unless the record shows an abuse of discretion. I find no such abuse in this case and therefore believe we should hold the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for appointed counsel.</div><div class="casepar">2. Neither do I believe the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial on the ground defendant's attorney failed to provide effective assistance of counsel. Defendant points to three alleged errors to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel: his attorney's lack of adequate opportunity to prepare for trial, the attorney's failure to object to certain testimony and the attorney's mistake in raising the issue of defendant's prior criminal record, thus opening the door to the introduction of harmful character evidence by the prosecutor. Because, as I conclude, the defendant was not entitled to appointed counsel, the attorney's lack of an adequate opportunity to prepare for trial is due to defendant's own failure to retain counsel prior to the commencement of trial. Defendant's second argument for showing ineffective assistance of counsel is also meritless. The testimony of certain witnesses concerning statements made to them by the victim is admissible pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/16/index.html">24-3-16</a></span> and the attorney's failure to object on the ground such testimony impermissibly bolstered the victim's testimony does not show attorney error. Finally, the testimony of defendant's trial attorney at the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial shows the attorney's decision to question defendant about his prior criminal record was not based solely on a lack of understanding that such testimony would permit the prosecution to present prejudicial character evidence but also on defendant's own misrepresentation to the attorney that he had no prior criminal record as an adult. Error which is induced by the defendant provides no basis for appeal. See Edwards v.
