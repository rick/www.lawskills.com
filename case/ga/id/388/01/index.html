Before Judge Knox.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">As a result of an automobile collision involving Ms. Ernestine Dupree's car, she and three of her passengers were killed and four of her passengers were severely injured. Plaintiffs, who are the surviving passengers, the guardians of the surviving minor passengers, and the administrator of the estates of the deceased passengers, brought suit against defendant Georgia Mutual Insurance Company. Alleging that defendant had issued an automobile insurance policy to Ms. Dupree, plaintiffs sought to recover no-fault benefits under that policy and, in addition, damages pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b) and (c). Defendant answered, raising as a defense the cancellation of Ms. Dupree's policy prior to the collision.</div><div class="casepar">The case proceeded to trial before a jury. At the close of the evidence, defendant moved for a directed verdict as to its compliance with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/44/index.html">33-24-44</a></span> in notifying Ms. Dupree of her policy's cancellation. See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/45/index.html">33-24-45</a></span> (d). The trial court granted defendant's motion as to this issue. Cross-motions for a directed verdict were then made as to defendant's compliance with former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) in notifying the Department of Public Safety of the cancellation of Ms. Dupree's policy. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for a directed verdict as to this issue and held that, as the result of defendant's failure to comply with former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1), there was no effective cancellation of Ms. Dupree's policy. Defendant then moved for a directed verdict as to its liability for damages pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b) and (c). The trial court granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict as to this issue. As the result of these rulings, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, but only for contractual no-fault benefits under the insurance policy.</div><div class="casepar">In Case No. 76595, plaintiffs appeal from the grant of defendant's motion for a directed verdict pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b) and (c), and from the grant of directed verdict on the issue of notifying Ms. Dupree of the cancellation of the policy. In Case No. 76596, defendant cross-appeals from the grant of plaintiffs' motion for a directed verdict with regard to construction of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a). We will address the cross-appeal first.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. 76596</div><div class="casepar">1. In this case, the insurance policy was issued on October 18, 1984, to be effective through April 18, 1985. On January 3, 1985, the insurer mailed the insured a notice of cancellation, effective January 14, 1985. The insurer, however, did not notify the Georgia Department of Public Safety of the cancellation until February 1, 1985. In doing so, the insurer did not strictly comply with former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1), which provided, in pertinent part, that "[t]he insurer, within five days after the effective date of a permitted cancellation of [no-fault] coverage, shall notify the Department of Public Safety in writing of the cancellation."</div><div class="casepar">Former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) did require "insurers to notify the Department of Public Safety before cancellation of no-fault automobile coverage can be effective. . . ." Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Phillips, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/4/index.html">251 Ga. 244 (304 SE2d 725) (1983)</a></span>. However, an insurer's failure to notify the Department of Public Safety within 5 days of the effective date of the cancellation would only result in the cancellation not being effective until such notification actually was made; it would not result in the total nullification of the insurer's attempt to cancel the policy. The requirement of notifying the Department of Public Safety of a cancellation of an insurance policy obviously had no purpose of protecting the insured, but rather was intended to further the Department of Public Safety's enforcement of the vehicle insurance laws. Accordingly, no persuasive reason exists for insisting upon strict compliance with the five-day notification requirement of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1).</div><div class="casepar">The automobile collision underlying this action occurred on April 10, 1985. Because the cancellation of the insurance policy was effective upon the insurer's notification to the Department of Public Safety on February 1, 1985, there was no coverage for the collision and the insurer was entitled to the directed verdict it sought.</div><div class="casepar">Case No. 76595</div><div class="casepar">2. Plaintiffs' enumeration of error concerning the trial court's grant of the insurer's motion for a directed verdict as to its liability for statutory penalties, attorney fees, and punitive damages pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b) and (c) is rendered moot by our holding in Division 1.</div><div class="casepar">3. Plaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred in its ruling that the insurer had complied with OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/44/index.html">33-24-44</a></span> in notifying Ms. Dupree of the cancellation of the insurance policy. In this case, the insurer's bulk mail clerk testified that she prepared a certificate of mailing for 370 notices of cancellation, one of which was addressed to Ms. Dupree. She then personally delivered to the postmaster the 370 pieces of mail along with the certificate of mailing and the P.O.R.S. list, and the post office certified receipt of the 370 pieces for bulk mailing. Under these uncontroverted circumstances, the notice of cancellation provisions of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/44/index.html">33-24-44</a></span> were satisfied, and the trial court properly directed verdict for the insurer on the issue. See Hill v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../524/27/index.html">151 Ga. App. 542 (260 SE2d 370) (1979)</a></span>; State Farm &amp;c. Ins. Co. v. Harris, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../426/05/index.html">177 Ga. App. 826 (341 SE2d 472) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">CARLEY, Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</div><div class="casepar">I believe that the trial court correctly entered a judgment in favor of the insureds as to their recovery of no-fault benefits under the policy issued to Ms. Dupree by the insurer. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent from the majority's reversal of the judgment in Case No. 76596.</div><div class="casepar">1. Pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/45/index.html">33-24-45</a></span> (d), the giving of notice to an insured is made a condition precedent to the cancellation of his automobile policy. There is no question that the insurer must strictly comply with that condition precedent. In addition, former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) provided, in relevant part, that "[t]he insurer, within five days after the effective date of a permitted cancellation of [no-fault] coverage, shall notify the Department of Public Safety in writing of the cancellation." Nothing in former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) specified that the giving of notice to the Department of Public Safety was an additional condition precedent to the insurer's effectuation of a successful cancellation of an insured's automobile policy. Accordingly, if consideration is limited solely to the language of the applicable statutory provisions, it might be possible to accept the majority's conclusion that an insurer's lack of strict compliance with the notice provision of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> "would not result in the total nullification of the insurer's attempt to cancel the policy." It is my opinion, however, that, notwithstanding the ostensible feasibility of the majority's conclusion, the interpretation heretofore given to former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> by the Supreme Court requires a contrary holding.</div><div class="casepar">Former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) "require[d] insurers to notify the Department of Public Safety before cancellation of no-fault automobile coverage [could] be effective. . . ." (Emphasis supplied.) Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Phillips, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/4/index.html">251 Ga. 244 (304 SE2d 725) (1983)</a></span>. See also Sentry Indem. Co. v. Sharif, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../734/6/index.html">248 Ga. 395</a></span>, 397 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../734/6/index.html">282 SE2d 907</a></span>) (1981); Pearce v. Southern Guaranty Ins. Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../784/3/index.html">246 Ga. 33 (268 SE2d 623) (1980)</a></span>. Thus, the Supreme Court has apparently construed an insurer's compliance with the provisions of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) as the satisfaction of a condition precedent to the effective cancellation of an automobile policy. " '[A] provision relating to the essence of the thing to be done, that is to matters of substance, is mandatory, and when a fair interpretation of a statute, which directs acts or proceedings to be done in a certain way, shows that the legislature intended a compliance with such provision to be essential to the validity of the Act or proceeding, or when some antecedent or prerequisite conditions must exist prior to the exercise of power or must be performed before certain other powers can be exercised, the statute must be regarded as mandatory.' " Barton v. Atkinson, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/01/index.html">228 Ga. 733</a></span>, 740 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../136/01/index.html">187 SE2d 835</a></span>) (1972). The majority cites no authority for holding that anything short of an insurer's strict compliance with former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span>, as a condition precedent to the effective cancellation of a policy of automobile insurance, would be sufficient. " 'The notice requirements of the statutes regarding cancellation of insurance policies are mandatory and require strict compliance and failure to adhere to the requirements results in noncancellation of the policy. [Cits.]' [Cit.]" (Emphasis supplied.) Perry &amp; Co. v. New South Ins. Brokers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/87/index.html">182 Ga. App. 84</a></span>, 86 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../405/87/index.html">354 SE2d 852</a></span>) (1987).</div><div class="casepar">If the majority were correct, then, notwithstanding the terms of the notice provided to the insured pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/45/index.html">33-24-45</a></span> (d), the date of effective cancellation of an automobile policy will remain uncertain until the insurer makes its own unilateral determination to provide the notice required by former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1). According to the majority, the cancellation would simply become effective at whatever point in time the insurer might subsequently provide notification to the Department of Public Safety. In my opinion, neither the uncertainty as to the date of cancellation nor the insurer's unilateral power to determine the effectiveness of the cancellation is warranted. As I construe the statutes, the date of proposed cancellation of an automobile policy must necessarily be established by the terms of the original written notice required to be provided to the insured pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/45/index.html">33-24-45</a></span> (d) and the effectiveness of that cancellation must necessarily be dependent upon the insurer's strict compliance with the mandatory notice requirements of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1). The insurer notified Ms. Dupree that it was electing to cancel her policy effective January 14, 1985. Within five days of that date, the insurer did not provide the additional notice required by former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1). Accordingly, the insurer's attempt to cancel Ms. Dupree's policy on the date that it had proposed was ineffective. If the insurer thereafter wished to effectuate a cancellation of Ms. Dupree's policy to be effective at a later date, it should be required to send her another notice of proposed cancellation pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/24/45/index.html">33-24-45</a></span> (d) and the insurer should not be permitted to urge that the effective date of its original cancellation attempt was merely suspended until such time as it might subsequently undertake to provide notice to the Department of Public Safety. The effectiveness of the cancellation of an automobile policy is, in my opinion, controlled by the insurer's strict compliance with all of the applicable statutory provisions regarding cancellation, and not by the insurer's unilateral compliance with its own less objective standards. See generally Perry &amp; Co. v. New South Ins. Brokers, supra at 86 (2).</div><div class="casepar">I believe that the trial court correctly construed the five-day time period of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1) as mandatory, and that the insurer's failure to comply therewith resulted in the noncancellation of Ms. Dupree's policy. Therefore, I dissent from the majority's reversal of the trial court's grant of the insured's motion for a directed verdict as to the existence of coverage under the policy.</div><div class="casepar">2. I concur in the affirmance of the judgment in Case No. 76595, but for different reasons than those given by the majority.</div><div class="casepar">It is my opinion that error, if any, in the grant of the insurer's motion for a directed verdict as to its compliance with the notice requirements of OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/45/index.html">33-34-45</a></span> (d) is moot. As previously discussed, regardless of the insurer's compliance with that statutory provision, the insureds were nevertheless entitled to recover no-fault benefits because the trial court correctly held that there was a noncancellation of Ms. Dupree's automobile policy as the result of the insurer's failure to comply strictly with the additional notice provision of former OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/10/index.html">33-34-10</a></span> (a) (1).</div><div class="casepar">I also agree that the trial court correctly granted the insurer's motion for a directed verdict as to its liability for statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and punitive damages pursuant to OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/33/34/6/index.html">33-34-6</a></span> (b) and (c).
