Stephens Superior Court. Before Judge Gunter.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Stephens County Tax Commissioner Elizabeth Williams was murdered at her home early in the morning of July 31, 1980. After Investigation, authorities suspected that former Tax Commissioner Donald Addison and Raymond McJunkin had hired John Michael Jones and the defendant in this case, James Everett Castell, to kill Mrs. Williams. The four of them were jointly indicted but tried separately. Castell was tried first, convicted, and sentenced to death. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> Jones was convicted and given a life sentence. His conviction was affirmed in Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../671/5/index.html">250 Ga. 11 (295 SE2d 71) (1982)</a></span>. Addison and McJunkin were acquitted.</div><div class="casepar">Jones was the state's key witness against Castell. He testified as follows. Castell and Jones were residents of South Carolina. At Castell's request, Jones drove him to Roger Dean's garage in Toccoa, Georgia, the Sunday before Mrs. Williams was killed. They returned Monday. Donald Addison was at the garage Monday, and after introducing him to Jones, Castell took Addison out of Jones' hearing and talked to him for several minutes. Later, Castell retrieved an envelope, containing $1,000 in $100 bills, from Raymond McJunkin's wrecker. Castell gave Jones $100. They returned Tuesday and Castell picked up an additional $500. At Castell's request, Jones again drove Castell to Toccoa early Thursday morning. When they arrived in Toccoa, they stopped and Castell made a call from a public telephone. Then he directed Jones to Mrs. Williams' residence. Jones parked in the driveway. Castell went to the front door and Mrs. Williams let him in. Jones heard a scream and then two shots. Castell exited the house, used his shirt to wipe off the doorknob, and came back to the car. They drove back to South Carolina, but returned to Toccoa the same day; Castell said he needed to pick up more money. On the way in, Castell threw his pistol into Lake Hartwell. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> Jones dropped Castell off at Roger Dean's garage, returned later, and the two drove back to South Carolina. Castell gave Jones an additional $200 for getting him involved.</div><div class="casepar">Jones' testimony as to Castell's participation was corroborated primarily by Burris Holbrooks, who testified as follows. Holbrooks worked in July and part of August, 1980, at Roger Dean's garage. Sometime during the third week in July, Addison, whom Holbrooks had known for 12 to 15 years, approached Holbrooks and asked him if he would break into the tax office and destroy records. Addison said that when the books were audited, he wanted it to look as though Mrs. Williams was trying to hide something. Holbrooks told Addison that he wouldn't do it. Later, Addison, who was running for tax commissioner, said the only way he could get elected was to get rid of Mrs. Williams. He asked Holbrooks if he would kill her for $1,500.</div><div class="casepar">Holbrooks again refused. Holbrooks later observed Addison talking to McJunkin and Castell. A day or two later, Addison told Holbrooks that Castell was his man and the job would be done before Friday. At lunchtime on Thursday, the day of the murder, Holbrooks observed the arrival of Jones and Castell at Roger Dean's garage. Castell made a telephone call. Ten or 15 minutes later, Addison arrived and talked with Castell, out of Holbrooks' hearing. When Holbrooks heard that Mrs. Williams had indeed been murdered, he went to the authorities with the foregoing information.</div><div class="casepar">In addition to the foregoing, the state offered evidence that on July 28, 1980, the Bank of Toccoa had loaned Addison $1,500; that during July and early August, 1980, a number of long distance telephone calls had been placed from the residence of T. R. McJunkin to that of Joan Chapman (Castell's ex-wife, with whom he was living at the time), and vice versa; and that when Castell was arrested on August 12, he had seven $100 bills in his back pocket.</div><div class="casepar">Castell testified that he did not kill Mrs. Williams; that he and Jones came to Georgia on the afternoon of July 31 because Jones wanted to see McJunkin about getting his job back; that the $700 in his pocket was part of $1,100 he had borrowed from his sister in the latter part of July to purchase a truck; and that, because his credit was no good, McJunkin was going to co-sign the note on the truck.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. James Williams testified that she observed one of the defendant's sisters lend him $1,100, in $100 and $20 bills. Vicki Castell (the defendant's sister-in-law) testified that, in July of 1980, she was living with Dale Upton and Michael Jones. Jones and Upton left the house together at 6:00 a.m. on the 31st and returned about dinner time. Mary Watkins (defendant's sister, but not the one who allegedly loaned him $1,100) testified that Jones had a reputation for violence and dishonesty.</div><div class="casepar">1. We address, first, the defendant's contentions that the declarations of alleged co-conspirator Addison were erroneously admitted, that the state failed to sufficiently corroborate the testimony of co-defendant Jones, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">(a) If a prima facie case of conspiracy is shown on the whole evidence, exclusive of declarations by an alleged co-conspirator, it is not error to admit such declarations over an objection that they are inadmissible hearsay. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/5/index.html">24-3-5</a></span> (Code Ann.  38-306); Knight v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../101/21/index.html">239 Ga. 594 (2) (238 SE2d 390) (1977)</a></span>; FaIlings v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../123/23/index.html">232 Ga. 798 (1) (209 SE2d 151) (1974)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">We do not agree with the defendant that, aside from the declarations, the only evidence of a conspiracy was "Jones witnessing the appellant and Addison conversing together, and the Addison bank loan." The circumstances, considered in their entirety, include: (a) several trips by Castell to Roger Dean's garage, where he obtained at least $1,500 in $100 bills from McJunkin's truck; (b) conversations between Addison and Castell, one of which occurred immediately prior to Castell's receipt of $1,000 and another of which occurred on the afternoon of the murder after Castell had made a special trip back to Toccoa; (c) payment of $300 by Castell to Jones; (d) the loan of $1,500 by the Bank of Toccoa to Addison, three days before the murder; (e) a number of long-distance telephone calls between McJunkin and Castell shortly before and after the murder; and (f) the seven $100 bills in Castell's back pocket when he was arrested.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence of conspiracy was sufficient to allow the introduction of declarations of the alleged co-conspirator Addison under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/5/index.html">24-3-5</a></span> (Code Ann.  38-306).</div><div class="casepar">(b) The defendant contends that if the admission of these declarations did not violate OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/5/index.html">24-3-5</a></span> (Code Ann.  38-306), it violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. See Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74 (91 SC 210, 27 LE2d 213) (1970).</div><div class="casepar">We note, first, that the defendant's right of confrontation was not abridged by Holbrooks' testimony that Addison had requested Holbrooks' assistance in committing a burglary and had offered him $1,500 to murder Mrs. Williams. The importance of these statements lies in the fact that they were made; it does not depend upon the veracity of the out-of-court declarant, Addison. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> "Neither a hearsay nor a confrontation question would arise [from use of testimony- to prove merely that the statement had been made. The hearsay rule does not prevent a witness from testifying to what he has heard; it is rather a restriction on the proof of fact through extrajudicial statements. From the viewpoint of the Confrontation Clause, a witness under oath, subject to cross-examination, and whose demeanor can be observed by the trier of fact, is a reliable informant not only to what he has seen but also to what he has heard." Dutton v. Evans, supra, 400 U. S. at p. 88 (footnote omitted).</div><div class="casepar">The confrontation issue arises in this case because the jury was invited to infer that Addison had implicitly identified Castell as the murderer when he told Holbrooks that Castell was his man and the job would be done before Friday. The thrust of Dutton v. Evans, supra, is that in cases involving a co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, the admission of the statement of a co-conspirator does not violate the confrontation clause if the statement and the circumstances surrounding it contain sufficient "indicia of reliability." Mooney v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../893/1/index.html">243 Ga. 373 (3) (254 SE2d 337) (1979)</a></span>. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Dutton v. Evans identified at least four factors indicative of reliability: " '(1) [T]he declaration contained no assertion of a past fact, and consequently carried a warning to the jury against giving it undue weight; (2) the declarant had personal knowledge of the identity and role of participants in the crime; (3) the possibility that the declarant was relying upon faulty recollection was remote; and (4) the circumstances under which the statements were made did not provide reason to believe that the declarant had misrepresented the defendant's involvement in the crime.' " United States v. Fielding, 630 F2d 1357, 1368 (9th Cir. 1980).</div><div class="casepar">All of these factors are present in this case. We conclude that the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by introduction of Addison's declarations.</div><div class="casepar">(c) In Georgia, a defendant may not be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/4/8/index.html">24-4-8</a></span> (Code Ann.  38-121). The corroboration must be independent of the accomplice's testimony and it must connect the defendant to the crime or lead to the inference that he is guilty. Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/68/index.html">215 Ga. 455 (111 SE2d 70) (1959)</a></span>. "However, the corroborating evidence need not of itself be sufficient to warrant a conviction of the crime charged. [Cit.] Slight evidence from an extraneous source identifying the accused as a participant in the criminal act is sufficient corroboration of the accomplice to support a verdict. [Cit.]" Reaves v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../931/0/index.html">242 Ga. 542</a></span>, 543 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../931/0/index.html">250 SE2d 376</a></span>) (1978).</div><div class="casepar">The corroborating evidence in this case included telephone records, the presence of $700 in Castell's back pocket when he was arrested, and Addison's statements identifying Castell as "my man." This was sufficient to corroborate Jones' testimony as to Castell's involvement in the murder of Mrs. Williams.</div><div class="casepar">(d) The evidence, reviewed in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to support the verdict. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">2. Next, we examine the defendant's contention that his rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (83 SC 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963), were violated.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant filed a five-page, pre-trial "motion for discovery, disclosure, inspection, and information necessary to receive a fair trial," purportedly "made under the authority of Brady v. Maryland" and other cited cases, containing broad requests to disclose information and produce documents. His final request was for all information that might be exculpatory, that might lead to exculpatory evidence, or that might benefit the defendant's preparation for trial. See Wilson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../785/8/index.html">246 Ga. 62</a></span>, 63, n. 2 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../785/8/index.html">268 SE2d 895</a></span>) (1980).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court conducted an in-camera inspection of the state's file. The court ordered that Jones' inconsistent statements be furnished to the defendant. Otherwise, the trial court found nothing exculpatory in the state's file.</div><div class="casepar">(a) We have independently reviewed the state's file, a copy of which was sealed and included in the record on appeal. We agree with the trial court that, aside from inconsistencies in Jones' statements, there was nothing exculpatory in the state's file.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The prosecutor, of course, may not suppress material evidence favorable to the accused, whether or not a request for such information is made or an in-camera inspection conducted. United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97 (96 SC 2392, 49 LE2d 342) (1976). Cf., Tribble v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../730/4/index.html">248 Ga. 274 (280 SE2d 352) (1981)</a></span>. The defendant contends that the record contains two instances of improper suppression.</div><div class="casepar">First, the defendant notes that Jones stated for the first time during trial that, after the murder, Castell asked Dale Upton to burn his trousers. The defendant contends that, since this fact was not mentioned in his previous statements, it would have been useful for impeachment purposes. Whether or not this is true (the statement is inculpatory, standing alone, and it is doubtful that the defendant would have introduced it if the state had not), we find no violation of the constitutional duty to disclose, for the simple reason that the statement was not suppressed.</div><div class="casepar">". . . Brady is not violated when the Brady material is available to defendants during trial. [Cits.]" United States v. Behrens, 689 F2d 154, 158 (10th Cir. 1982). "Brady does not require pre-trial disclosure of the materials." United States v. Sweeney, 688 F2d 1131, 1141 (7th Cir. 1982). Jones was extensively cross-examined about Inconsistencies in his earlier statements (Jones originally denied any involvement in the crime) and was further cross-examined about his failure to make earlier mention of the clothes-burning (because, Jones said, he wasn't asked). Earlier disclosure would not have benefited the defense, and the delayed disclosure did not deprive him of a fair trial. Waflin v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../722/4/index.html">248 Ga. 29 (6) (279 SE2d 687) (1981)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Second, the defendant contends that certain information divulged by a Toccoa police officer to Addison's investigator in August of 1980 was never presented to the defendant. For the gist of this information, we are referred to an affidavit by Addison's investigator, offered during the defendant's motion for new trial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span></div><div class="casepar">"There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not create one . . ." Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559 (97 SC 837, 51 LE2d 30) (1977). Brady cannot be read as requiring that "as a matter of constitutional law everything must be disclosed which might influence a jury." United States v. Orzechowski, 547 F2d 978, 985 (7th Cir. 1977). If that were the case, "the only way a prosecutor could discharge his constitutional duty would be to allow complete discovery of his files as a matter of routine practice." United States v. Agurs, supra, 427 U. S. at p. 109. Clearly, then, not every nondisclosure of exculpatory information is error. Rather, where the omitted evidence was not specifically requested, nondisclosure is error only "if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist." Id. at p. 112.</div><div class="casepar">3. The defendant makes two additional contentions regarding discovery:</div><div class="casepar">(a) He contends that his rights under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/210/index.html">17-7-210</a></span> (Code Ann.  27-1302) were violated by the failure of the state to provide him, at least 10 days prior to the trial, with statements made by Addison. We find no error. The law relied upon by the defendant plainly states that "the defendant shall be entitled to have a copy of any statement given by him while in police custody." (Emphasis supplied.) See Walraven v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../682/0/index.html">250 Ga. 401 (2) (297 SE2d 278) (1982)</a></span>. Addison's statements were not made in police custody and the defendant was, moreover, not entitled, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/210/index.html">17-7-210</a></span> (Code Ann.  27-1302), to statements made by a co-defendant.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The defendant filed a post-trial motion to inspect the state's files on the cases of Donald Addison and Raymond McJunkin. By the time this motion was made, Addison and McJunkin had been acquitted. The defendant contended that these files were therefore reviewable by him, pursuant to OCGA Title 50, Ch. 18, Art. 4 (Inspection of Public Records,  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/50/18/70/index.html">50-18-70</a></span> et seq. (Code Ann.  40-2701 et seq.)). The state responded that, assuming its files were "public records" within the meaning of the law, these cases were still under investigation for possible federal prosecutions. On this basis, the trial court denied the defendant's motion. We find no error. Houston v. Rutledge, <span class="casemissing">237 Ga. 764 (229 SE2d 624) (1976)</span>.</div><div class="casepar">4. The defendant filed pre-trial motions for funds to hire an expert to examine fingerprint and ballistics evidence, and for funds to hire an investigator. These motions were denied. The defendant concedes that the general rule is that the grant or denial of a motion for assistance of expert witnesses and other investigative services lies within the sound discretion of the trial court (see, e.g., High v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../763/8/index.html">247 Ga. 289 (2) (276 SE2d 5) (1981)</a></span>), but contends that in this case, the trial court refused to exercise its discretion.</div><div class="casepar">During the hearing on the motions, the court stated, in essence, that it was not going to grant the defendant's motions unless the defendant could provide the court with a case holding that such motions must be granted. The defendant was, of course, unable to do so.</div><div class="casepar">We are not persuaded that the court's comments should be interpreted as a refusal to exercise discretion. The defendant cited to the court a number of cases holding that the grant of such assistance was within the discretion of the court. The state offered no suggestion to the contrary. In view of this and also considering that the defendant failed to demonstrate any need for state-provided expert or investigative assistance, we are of the opinion that the trial court was merely stating its intention to exercise its discretion against the defendant unless the defendant presented the court with a case holding that the court could not so exercise its discretion. Thus, we find no error in the court's ruling.</div><div class="casepar">5. The defendant complains that the trial court overly restricted his voir dire and erroneously denied three of his challenges for cause.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The trial court did not err in refusing to allow the defendant to ask prospective jurors about their prior jury service, Frazier v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../572/44/index.html">138 Ga.

State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../515/19/index.html">153 Ga. App. 21 (3) (264 SE2d 516) (1980)</a></span>; to ask prospective jurors their understanding of matters of law (such as the presumption of innocence, death penalty procedure, or the necessity for unanimity of verdicts), Lundy v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../595/78/index.html">130 Ga. App. 171 (2) (202 SE2d 536) (1973)</a></span>; or to ask prospective jurors questions which might require them to prejudge the case, Waters v.

Ibid. No abuse of discretion has been demonstrated in this case.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The trial court did not err in refusing to grant the defendant's challenges for cause where none of the challenged prospective jurors had seen the crime committed, had heard testimony under oath, or had an opinion "so fixed and definite that it would not be changed by the evidence or charge of the court upon the trial of the case."

Regarding the defendant's motion for change of venue:</div><div class="casepar">(a) The defendant contends that the court erred by failing "to allow the defense to subpoena out-of-state documents and witnesses necessary to validate [the defendant's] need for change of venue." This contention is not supported by argument or citation of authority and must be deemed abandoned. Supreme Court Rule 45.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for change of venue. We find no error. Of the 89 prospective jurors who underwent voir dire, 17 were excused for bias and prejudice. Three others were excused because they had participated in the establishment of or had contributed to a reward fund with respect to this case. These 20 jurors constituted only 22% of the entire panel. This percentage corroborates the absence of such prejudicial publicity as would require the grant of a motion for change of venue. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source8" href="#note8">8</a></span> Messer v.

Allen v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../744/2/index.html">248 Ga. 676 (286 SE2d 3) (1982)</a></span>. These two prospective jurors were Mrs. Prather and Mrs. Mouchet.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The voir dire of Mrs. Prather transpired as follows:</div><div class="casepar">BY THE COURT:</div><div class="casepar">"Q.

We find no error. Mrs. Prather clearly stated that she would vote against the death penalty no matter what the trial might reveal. The defendant thereafter attempted to rehabilitate her by ascertaining whether or not under some circumstances the juror could "consider" the death penalty, not "impose" it. "It is not sufficient that the juror be willing to 'consider' the death penalty if he or she is committed to automatically vote against the death penalty after having considered' it." Cofield v.

The state contends that the defendant's failure to object amounts to a procedural default precluding appellate determination of the Witherspoon issue on its merits. See, e.g., Rivers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../680/2/index.html">250 Ga. 303 (7) (298 SE2d 1) (1982)</a></span>; Gober v.

See Morris v. State, <span class="casemissing">200 Ga. 471 (1) (37 SE2d 345) (1946)</span>." State v.

Nonetheless, we have been less stringent in our enforcement of a strict contemporaneous objection rule as to error that may affect a sentence of death because we must, under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/35/index.html">17-10-35</a></span> (c) (1) (Code Ann.  27-2537), determine whether the sentence was imposed as a result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. Gilreath v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../783/3/index.html">247 Ga. 814 (15) (279 SE2d 650) (1981)</a></span>. For example, we have held that although "it is [normally] the obligation of the party who asserts error to show it affirmatively by the record [cit.] . . . failure to record the Witherspoon voir dire in a case in which the sentence of death is imposed, is reversible error." Owens v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../120/29/index.html">233 Ga. 869</a></span>, 871, 873 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../120/29/index.html">214 SE2d 173</a></span>) (1975). And in Davis v. State, <span class="casemissing">236 Ga. 804 (1) (225 SE2d 241) (1976)</span>, we considered an alleged Witherspoon error on its merits despite the lack of a proper objection. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source9" href="#note9">9</a></span> Thus, in this case, we must consider the defendant's belated objection to the dismissal of Mrs. Mouchet on its merits.</div><div class="casepar">We conclude that the trial court did not err by dismissing Mrs. Mouchet. Use of phrases such as "I think so" or "I don't think so" do not, when considered in the context of the entire voir dire of the juror, necessarily indicate an equivocation with regard to an unwillingness to impose a death penalty. The answers of Mrs. Mouchet, considered together, unambiguously reveal an intent to vote against the death penalty no matter what the evidence showed, and she was properly excused. Krier v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../699/0/index.html">249 Ga. 80 (287 SE2d 531) (1982)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">8. The defendant contends that the trial court erred by overruling his three motions for mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">(a) The first motion was made near the onset of the state's examination of Jones:</div><div class="casepar">"Q. [By the state] At that time [the week before the trial] . . . I instructed you, there was no deals of any kind?</div><div class="casepar">"A. Yes, sir."</div><div class="casepar">"Q. And you are fully aware you are also charged with murder?</div><div class="casepar">"A. Yes, sir.</div><div class="casepar">"Q. I ask you whether or not that I personally instructed you also that under the laws of Georgia, under conspiracy, and under parties [to] a crime regardless of your participation, you was as guilty as the rest of them?</div><div class="casepar">"A. Yes, sir."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant objected to the last question and moved for a mistrial, on the ground that the district attorney had stated a personal belief in the defendant's guilt. The state contends that, since the allegedly improper comment was a question and not a comment, it was not objectionable.</div><div class="casepar">OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/75/index.html">17-8-75</a></span> (Code Ann.  81-1009) states: "Where counsel in the hearing of the jury make statements of prejudicial matters which are not in evidence, it is the duty of the court to interpose and prevent the same. On objection made, the court shall also rebuke the counsel and by all needful and proper instructions to the jury endeavor to remove the improper impression from their minds; or, in his discretion, he may order a mistrial if the prosecuting attorney is the offender." "This Code section has been applied not only in situations where counsel have made improper statements or prejudicial remarks in the presence of the jury during a trial, but it also has been applied where [the] same is made 'in the form of a question.' [Cits.]" Hamilton v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../510/65/index.html">155 Ga. App. 799</a></span>, 800 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../510/65/index.html">272 SE2d 763</a></span>) (1980). Thus, we cannot agree with the state that the comment was not objectionable simply because it came in the form of a question.</div><div class="casepar">It has long been the rule that a district attorney may not state to the jury his personal belief in the defendant's guilt. See, e.g., Wells v. State, <span class="casemissing">194 Ga. 70 (5) (20 SE2d 580) (1942)</span>. The question to which the defendant objected did imply a belief in the defendant's guilt and the trial court erred by overruling the defendant's objection and by failing to take the corrective action contemplated by OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/75/index.html">17-8-75</a></span> (Code Ann.  81-1009). Nevertheless, we find no blatant misconduct in this case; the state's question did not mention the defendant by name, and it is apparent that the state was trying, not to state a belief that the defendant was guilty, but to establish that Jones was aware of the charges against him and of the seriousness of those charges, that no deals had been made for his testimony, and that he was nonetheless willing to testify. Because we find that it is highly probable that this error did not contribute to the verdict, we find no reversible error. Johnson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../102/43/index.html">238 Ga. 59 (230 SE2d 869) (1976)</a></span>; Bentley v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../593/72/index.html">131 Ga. App. 425 (205 SE2d 904) (1974)</a></span>. For the same reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The second motion for mistrial came at the end of the defendant's cross-examination of Jones. After securing Jones' admission that his first statement was a lie and that not all of his second statement was true, the defendant's attorney sought, by use of suggestive questions, to secure Jones' admission that he was still lying; that Castell had not been with Jones on the morning of the murder and that Jones, not the defendant, had walked into the house and shot Mrs. Williams. Jones responded to these questions with vigorous denials. When the defendant's attorney finished, the district attorney stated, "Your Honor, if Mr. Harvey does not offer witnesses to substantiate everything that he has been telling this man that he did, he is totally wrong in the examination of this man." The defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that the district attorney's objection was an improper comment on his right not to testify.</div><div class="casepar">We cannot agree with the district attorney's suggestion that the questioning by the defendant's attorney violated DR 7-106 (C). A party has the right to a thorough and sifting cross-examination of the witnesses called against him and, usually, to conduct that examination by use of leading questions. OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/63/index.html">24-9-63</a></span>, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/9/64/index.html">24-9-64</a></span> (Code Ann.  38-1706, 38-1705). Leading questions are suggestive. Ealey v. State, <span class="casemissing">139 Ga. App. 110 (227 SE2d 902) (1976)</span>. In view of the evidence connecting Jones with the crime and his prior inconsistent statements, the defendant properly inquired into Jones' veracity and the extent of his actual participation. We do not believe, however, that the state's objection, if such it was, amounted to improper comment on the defendant's right not to testify, see Bryant v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../540/71/index.html">146 Ga. App. 43 (1) (245 SE2d 333) (1978)</a></span>, or that the trial court erred by denying the defendant's motion for mistrial.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The third motion for mistrial occurred during the state's cross-examination of the defendant, when the district attorney asked, "Then I ask you whether or not when you went in and she screamed, was she on her knees or was she standing up?" The defendant objected and moved for a mistrial. For reasons stated above, the question was proper, and the trial court did not err by refusing to grant a mistrial. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source10" href="#note10">10</a></span></div><div class="casepar">9. After the defendant rested, he was allowed to re-open the evidence so that he could testify in his own behalf. He again rested. The next day, the defendant sought to re-open a second time so that he could present the testimony of Donald Addison, who previously had indicated that he would not be willing to testify. The defendant's attorney told the court that only after he had rested a second time did he learn that Addison had changed his mind and would now testify. The state objected, contending that all of the state's witnesses, some of whom could have rebutted portions of Addison's testimony, had been dismissed and it would take days to get them back.</div><div class="casepar">The court refused to allow the defendant to re-open a second time. The defendant contends that this refusal was error. We cannot agree. It is well established that the matter of re-opening the evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Roberts, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../768/6/index.html">247 Ga. 456</a></span>, 457 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../768/6/index.html">277 SE2d 644</a></span>) (1981).

We address the defendant's contention that the trial court's charge was deficient in several particulars:</div><div class="casepar">(a) The court's charge on malice was not error. Franklin v.

The trial court properly admitted the declarations of the co-conspirator, and the jury was entitled to consider all of the evidence in its consideration of the existence of the conspiracy.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court properly refused to give the defendant's request to charge that, in determining whether a conspiracy existed, the jury could not consider the declarations of the alleged accomplice.</div><div class="casepar">(c) The court did not err by charging that an accessory after the fact is not an accomplice. Moore v.

Evidence existed which would have supported a finding that the alleged accomplice acted under duress or coercion and was therefore not an accomplice (even though she may have been guilty of murder, because coercion is no defense to murder). The court, however, erroneously gave a charge to the jury which would have allowed the jury to find that the testimony of the alleged accomplice had been corroborated, when there was no evidence in the case from which the jury could have found such corroboration. Although, under one theory (the witness was not an accomplice) a conviction would have been proper, under another theory, erroneously presented to the jury (the witness was an accomplice, but her testimony was corroborated), the conviction would have been improper.</div><div class="casepar">In this case, there was evidence from which the jury could have found corroboration, and the court's charge on accomplices and the requirement of corroboration was not erroneous.</div><div class="casepar">(e) Finally, the trial court did not err by refusing to give the defendant's requests to charge concerning the testimony of an informer who provides evidence for personal advantage, or the testimony of any person induced by promises of immunity from further punishment. There was no evidence to support either charge. Treadwell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../600/14/index.html">129 Ga.

The defendant contends that the trial court erred by refusing to give his requests to charge during the sentencing phase of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">The following statutory aggravating circumstances were presented to the jury: (1) the defendant "committed the offense of murder for another, to-wit: Donald Addison and Raymond McJunkin, for the purpose of receiving money and other thing of monetary value" (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (4) (Code Ann.  27-2534.1)); and (2) the defendant "committed murder as an agent and employee of Donald Addison and Raymond McJunkin" (OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (6) (Code Ann.  27-2534.1)).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err by refusing to give the defendant's requested charge pertaining to the  (b) (4) aggravating circumstance. "The failure to give requested instructions in the exact language requested, where the charge given substantially covers the same principles, is not grounds for reversal." Kelly v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../946/9/index.html">241 Ga. 190 (4) (243 SE2d 857) (1978)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Nor did the trial court err by refusing to give the defendant's charge pertaining to the  (b) (6) aggravating circumstance. The defendant contends that the terms "agent" and "employee" in  (b) (6) should be given the same meanings as they are given in the context of agency or tort law. For example, the defendant contends that a person would not be an "employee" under  (b) (6) unless his employer" had the right to control the performance of the employee and to direct the manner in which the work shall be done.</div><div class="casepar">The terms "agent" and "employee" are words of art in other contexts, with meanings pertinent to and shaped by those contexts. We do not think that these meanings should be transposed to our death penalty statute. This conclusion is bolstered by our examination of  (b) (6) in its entirety, which states: "The offender caused or directed another to commit murder or committed murder as an agent or employee of another person." It is clear that the legislature intended that  (b) (6) be applicable to murders for hire and that it be applicable to both the hirer and the one hired. One would expect, therefore, a reciprocity of liability with respect to the two halves of  (b) (6); i.e., one should be an "agent" or" employee" of another if one were "caused or directed" to commit murder by the other. This would not necessarily be the case if the terms "agent" and "employee" were given the meanings offered by the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">We hold that the terms "agent" and "employee," as used in OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/10/30/index.html">17-10-30</a></span> (b) (6) (Code Ann.  27-2534.1), should be given their common, everyday meanings: An employee is one who is hired by another and an agent is one who acts for another. The defendant's request to charge was an inaccurate statement of the law, and the trial court properly refused to give it.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant makes no argument with respect to his other requests to charge. We have nonetheless examined them and find that they are either inappropriate or essentially covered by the court's charge.</div><div class="casepar">16. We are not required by Enmund v. Florida, ---- U. S. ---- (102 SC 3368, 73 LE2d 1140) (1982), to declare unconstitutional any aggravating circumstance which, on its face, might allow a jury to impose a death sentence on someone who had no intent to kill. The defendant's contention to the contrary is meritless.</div><div class="casepar">17. Aggravating circumstances, such as  (b) (4) and  (b) (6), are not invalid because they might overlap to some extent. Nor is  (b) (6) unconstitutionally vague.</div><div class="casepar">18.

Although defendants who were hired to commit murder have been given life sentences, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source12" href="#note12">12</a></span> cases cited in the appendix show that juries find the death penalty to be appropriate punishment in contract murder cases.</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, the jury in this case had before it evidence of the defendant's prior record. The defendant had a 1963 conviction for housebreaking and larceny, for which he was given a six-year sentence; a 1965 conviction for larceny, for which he was given an eight-year sentence; an additional 1965 conviction for housebreaking and larceny, for which he was given a nine-year sentence; a 1971 conviction for armed robbery, grand larceny and receiving stolen goods, for which he was given an 18-year sentence; an additional 1971 conviction for armed robbery, grand larceny and receiving stolen goods, for which he was also given an 18-year sentence; and a 1979 conviction for escape, for which he was given a 15-month sentence (these were all South Carolina convictions). The defendant had only been released from custody a few weeks before he murdered Mrs. Williams. Our cases show that a defendant's prior record is a factor taken into consideration by juries. The serious and extensive prior record of this defendant provides additional support for the imposition of the death penalty in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The cases listed in the appendix support the death penalty in this case.</div><div class="casepar"> Horton v.

      This affidavit states: 'On August 21, 1980, Affiant interviewed Lt. Mack Thomason of the Toccoa Police Department who told Affiant that the original call reporting this incident came into the Toccoa Police Department to Dispatcher Marion Smith. Ptl. Green and Ptl. Jimmy Carpenter were first to the crime scene."Officer Thomas on advised that he put out a general lookout for an automobile because Mr. O. N. Williams gave a very general description."Officer Thomason advised that he arrived on the scene at approximately 7:30 A.M. and proceeded to canvass the neighbors. Officer Thomason advised that Mr. O. N. Williams had gone to three houses before finding the Hunts, where he (Mr. Williams) said 'Come see Mrs. Williams.'"Officer Thomason advised that no measurements of [sic] sketches were made of the scene at that time."Further, Affiant was advised that Officer Thomason received a phone call from a confidential informant, which information eventually helped to lead to the arrest of the above defendant."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;

      There was trial testimony that: (a) O. N. Williams returned to his house at approximately 7:30 a.m. and saw a 1973 or 1975 gray Chrysler-product car with a red or maroon top leaving his driveway; (b) After he discovered the body, Mr. Williams went to at least two houses seeking help; (c) No crime-scene measurements were made until Charles Moss arrived from the state crime lab several hours later.

      Addison did not subsequently testify at the sentencing phase. The defendant originally contended on appeal that the failure to call Addison then amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, by letter to this court dated February 7, 1983, counsel for the defendant abandoned this contention; after refreshing his memory by conferring with co-counsel, he remembered that Addison was not called at the sentencing phase because, 'after the trial court refused to allow Mr. Addison's testimony at the guilt/innocence phase, Mr. Addison once again advised the defense that he would refuse to testify."</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note12" href="#source12">12</a></span>&nbsp;
