November 1, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, Presiding Judge.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">There is sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court.</div><div class="casepar">"5. Petitioners show that Earl L. Culpepper and House, Inc. were named as defendants in said cases, and both filed answers in each of said cases.</div><div class="casepar">"6. Petitioners show that thereafter on January 22, 1957, a jury in Fulton Superior Court tried both of said cases together, rendering the following judgments: In the Mrs. J. B. Stevens case, a verdict and judgment was rendered in her behalf for $750 plus costs against Earl L. Culpepper, one of the petitioners herein; and in the J. B. Stevens case, a verdict and judgment was on the same day rendered in his behalf for $1,500 plus costs against Earl L. Culpepper.</div><div class="casepar">"7. Petitioners show that on or about the 30th day of March, 1955, Earl L. Culpepper, one of the petitioners herein, was operating a certain 1954 Chevrolet automobile, which said automobile was registered in the name of House, Inc., and generally used by Raymond R. House, president of House, Inc.</div><div class="casepar">"8. Petitioners show that the said 1954 Chevrolet automobile, which was being used by petitioner Earl L. Culpepper on said occasion, was insured by an automobile liability fleet policy issued by General Insurance Company of America to the defendant House, Inc., which said policy was at the time of said collision in full force and effect, and which said policy contained an omnibus clause, which simply means that the coverage afforded by said policy was extended to the named assured, House, Inc., as well as to anyone using said vehicle with consent. A copy of said policy, with endorsements, is here to attached, marked Exhibit A and by reference made a part hereof.</div><div class="casepar">"10. Petitioners allege that on the date of the said accident the said Earl L. Culpepper, one of the petitioners herein, was operating the said 1954 Chevrolet automobile by and with the permission of House, Inc., through Raymond R. House, its president.</div><div class="casepar">"11. It is therefore contended by petitioners that the coverage afforded under the policy issued by General Insurance Company of America was the primary coverage on the said 1954 Chevrolet automobile at the time of said collision and also that the coverage afforded under the said policy issued by Georgia Casualty &amp; Surety Company, one of the petitioners herein, became under the terms of said policy excess coverage; that the amounts of the judgments rendered in said cases come within the limitation of said policy issued by General Insurance Company of America.</div><div class="casepar">"12. It is conceded by petitioners that if petitioner Earl L. Culpepper did not have permission to use said 1954 Chevrolet automobile at the time of the said collision, on March 30, 1955, the coverage afforded by the policy issued by the Georgia Casualty &amp; Surety Company would become primary rather than excess coverage.</div><div class="casepar">"13. Petitioners show that on June 10, 1955, petitioners and defendants entered into a contract by the terms of which both of said named insurance companies undertook to defend the said actions under the reservations contained in said contract, a copy of which is hereto attached, marked Exhibit C and by reference made a part hereof.</div><div class="casepar">"14. Petitioners allege that the controversy involved is which of said insurance companies should pay the said judgments rendered in said cases against Earl L. Culpepper.</div><div class="casepar">"15. Petitioners allege that the principal issue of fact is whether or not said Earl L. Culpepper was at the time, on March 30, 1955, operating said 1954 Chevrolet automobile with permission. Although this question of fact is raised by the petitioners, the determination of the same by a jury is expressly waived by the petitioners."</div><div class="casepar">The defendants answered as follows: "1. Defendants admit the allegations of paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13 and 14. 2. Paragraphs 2, 3, 12 and 16 require no answer of these defendants. 3. Defendants deny as alleged paragraph 8. 4. Defendants deny the allegations of paragraphs 10 and 11. 5. Defendants deny as alleged paragraph 15. These defendants do not waive jury trial of the question of fact raised by petitioners."</div><div class="casepar">By agreement between counsel the case was tried before Judge Andrews of the Superior Court of Fulton County without a jury, which resulted in a judgment declaring the defendants not liable. A motion for a new trial was filed on the general grounds only, which motion was denied. It is on this judgment that the case is here for review.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence is substantially as follows: Earl L. Culpepper testified that he is an employee of House, Inc., and that he shares an apartment with Mr. Raymond House, president of the corporation; that although the witness has his own car which he uses for business purposes with expenses paid by House, Inc., it was his habit at times to use Mr. House's 1954 Chevrolet on business with general permission and for personal use with direct permission; that on March 30, 1955, shortly after midnight he went to his apartment and awoke Mr. House to ask permission to borrow his car; that his own car was giving him trouble and he needed Mr. House's car to take his companion's date to her home in Doraville; that Mr. House told him he could borrow the car for that purpose reminding him that "it was necessary for him to pick up someone around 7 o'clock that morning." He stated that reference was made to 7 o'clock because "well, I just woke him up and he might not have known exactly what time it was. He knew it was early in the morning." The witness further testified that he drove the pair to Doraville, let the girl out and brought the boy back to the apartment; that it was about 3:30 a.m.; that he let the boy use witness's car to drive himself home; that he then entered his apartment and went into the downstairs kitchen for a drink of water, then he got back in Mr. House's Chevrolet and drove back to Doraville to the same place; that he left Doraville about 6 a.m. to return to the apartment and was involved in an accident on Tilly Mill Road; that he required emergency treatment and did not get in touch with Mr. House until approximately 7:30 or 7:45.</div><div class="casepar">Raymond House testified that he was not quite sure what time it was when Culpepper woke him up to borrow the car; that he loaned Culpepper the car for the purpose of taking the boy and girl home and nothing more was said about the use of the car; that he did not give Culpepper permission to make a second trip to Doraville that morning; that he mentioned the 7 a.m. time, not because he was giving him the car until 7 a.m. but because he needed the car to go to work at that time.</div><div class="casepar">The same witness testified on cross-examination that he permitted Culpepper to use his Chevrolet on business and for personal use; that on March 30, 1955, around midnight Culpepper came into his bedroom and woke him up asking to borrow the car. He further testified as follows: "Q. Do you remember on that occasion [when witness loaned Mr. Culpepper the car] whether you said anything about it specifically or not, whether or not he was to be back by 7? A. Yes, sir, I had to go to Austell. He knew that. Q. You told him to be back by 7 o'clock? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now, Mr. House, I will ask you didn't you give Mr. Culpepper permission to use your car on his own business from whatever time it was? A. It was around--whenever he first came there it was around midnight, woke me up. I don't know exactly what time, around 12. Q. You gave him permission when you let him have the keys to use it for his own purpose just so he got it back by 7 o'clock the next morning, is that right? A. That's right. Q. Now, did it make any difference to you whether or not he took Kirbo home or let him go home in his car, did that make any difference to you? A. No, not concerned about it. Q. You wasn't concerned about it? A. Wasn't concerned. Q. The only concern was that he get it back by the next morning by the time you needed it? A, Yes. Q. And if he had gotten it back the next morning to you by 7 o'clock, the fact that he had been to Doraville twice or three times or had been some other place would be of no consequence as far as you were concerned, isn't that right? A. That's right." On recross-examination the same witness testified that he just loaned Culpepper the Chevrolet for his own purpose until witness needed it the next morning.</div><div class="casepar"> In support of the contention for reversal, counsel for the petitioner cite Hodges v. Ocean Acci- dent &amp;c. Corp., <span class="casemissing">66 Ga. App. 431</span> (18 S. E. 2d 28). In that case the policy provided that any person was insured who used the car for "pleasure and business" or "commercial" with the permission of the insured. The court defined the difference between "permission" and "first instance permission." The evidence there showed that the car was being used for a purpose not authorized by the insured and therefore the insurance company was not liable. Drake v. General Accident, Fire &amp;c. Assurance Corp., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../710/57/index.html">88 Ga. App. 408</a></span> (77 S. E. 2d 71), cited by counsel for the petitioner, showed implied permission on the part of the owner for the driver to use the car. The holding in that case is not contrary to what we are holding in the instant case.</div><div class="casepar">The judge of the trial court did not err in the ruling.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
