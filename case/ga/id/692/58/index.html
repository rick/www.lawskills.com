Craig filed a claim for workmen's compensation against Riegel Textile Corporation, The single deputy director found against the claimant. On appeal, the full board also found against the claimant. On appeal to the superior court, that court reversed the award of the full board and the employer excepts.</div><div class="casepar">The claimant testified in part as follows: that on January 9, 1956, she was employed by the defendant as a sweeper; that in the performance of her employment duties her feet slipped out from under her and she fell across a doff box; that at that time she experienced a sharp pain in her back and hip; that immediately after her fall she reported the incident to her overseer who asked her questions and made a report thereon; that she did not consult a doctor immediately but did consult a doctor on May 21, 1956; that she continued working up until the time of her operation in October of 1956; that she took pain tablets during that time in order to work; that a short time after her fall her back started "bothering" her continually; that the pain in her back and hips became so severe that she went to see a doctor on May 21, 1956; that she later consulted another doctor and a chiropractor concerning her back and hips; that she finally consulted Dr. Little who referred her to Dr. Warren Kimsey, a specialist who operated on her; that during World War II she had hurt her back in lifting a cut of cloth while working for the defendant; that she did not tell anyone connected with the defendant that she wanted any medical attention for her back but that they knew she had consulted a doctor in May; that the doctors she consulted were doctors of her own choice; that she had had some back pains for a period of twenty years but "not all the time for years, I have had a little trouble with my back back yonder but it didn't bother me continually all these years"; that when she was "nearly grown" she had suffered a fall; that in addition to the operation performed by Dr. Kimsey on her back she had had only two previous operations and they were "female" operations; that a little more than three years previously she had had trouble with her back after an operation and had consulted a doctor about it; that at that time her back pains had been worse than usual for about two months, that she had had no difficulty on the job in reaching to the floor to get something until after the fall in January of 1956; that in the period of twenty to thirty years before the fall when she was having back pains, she did not experience any pain in her legs; that the back pains she suffered during such twenty or thirty year period were not similar to those suffered after the fall in January, 1956.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Warren Kimsey testified in part as follows: "Q. Dr. Kimsey, do you know Mrs. Roxie G. Craig, Route 2, Lyerly, Georgia? A. Yes, sir. Q. What was the first occasion you had to see her, in your professional capacity? A. On 16 October, 1956. Q. When you talked with her on the date, did she give you a history? A. Yes, sir, she did. Q. What was that history, Doctor? A. She stated to me that she had been to see Dr. R. N. Little and she complained of pains in her back and right hip and right leg for nine months. Q. Did she tell you about any accident she had had at the Riegel Textile Mill? A. The patient stated that she stepped in water or oil at the Riegel Textile Mill on 9 January 1956 and fell. Her right shoulder and arm went down in a doff box and she was twisted. She had mild back pain and reported to her supervisor. In March her back pain became worse and she had some hip pains. She saw Dr. Norton and he treated her until last month with shots and capsules. Then in June, the pain went out of her left hip and became worse on the right. This pain gradually became worse and began to radiate all the way down her right leg. Her leg began to get numb and coughing and exertion increased her pain. Q. I believe you say that she reported this to Dr. R. N. Little, a medical doctor in Summerville, Georgia, is that right, Doctor? A. Yes, sir, she stated that Dr. Little had examined her recently and I guess it was in October, 1956, and he told her that she had a ruptured disc. That is in quotes, 'ruptured disc'. Q. On the 16th of October, 1956, did you perform a neurological examination on Mrs. Craig? A. Yes, sir, I did. . . Q. Was there anything about those tests that showed anything wrong with her disc? A. Well, across her back it was obvious, you could see that she had a protruding disc even before her clothes had been removed. Q. Did you notice any hyperalgesia? A. Yes, sir, the initial examination showed that there was very mild hyperalgesia in the L-5 dermatomes on the right, and that was across the fourth inter-space. . . Q. Did you perform any operation on Mrs. Craig the day after the myelogram was done? A. Yes, sir, I did, it was the next day, on 23 October, 1956, under a local anesthetic. Q. And what did you find at that time, did you find a ruptured disc in the spinal canal? A. Yes, sir, a local operation was done for removal of a completely extruded disc. The entire disc was found to be ruptured into the spinal canal and the removal was most difficult. I went up under the dura nerve route and I finally got it out. Q. Let me ask you this, Doctor, was this disc protruding and if it was, to what degree was it protruding? A. Yes, sir, it was quite large and I had to operate on the left side on the spinal canal, it was quite large and I couldn't reach across from underneath on this side, and it is my opinion that she will have to have more work done later on, on the other side. Q. I will ask you, Doctor, whether or not that disc was caused by any traumatic injury she may have received? A. Well, with a complete injury like that, I would probably think so, yes, sir. Q. And was her condition or the condition that she was in, was it caused by the injury she received on the 9th day of January, 1956? A. Well, I think so, she said she twisted her body, I believe she stated that she fell to one side and her body twisted in such a way as when you play golf, I don't know if you know how to play golf or not, but that is the position her body twisted in and this is important to an injured disc, for a person to twist their body sharply in this position as she did and I certainly attached some importance to it. Q. The fact that she might have had this back trouble before this time, do you attach any great impor-</div><div class="casepar">tance to that, concerning this particular disc trouble? A. Well, assuming that she was getting older, and everybody's discs degenerate during the years and they rupture sometimes, and they will rupture after there has been some injury to the back or a sharp twisting of the body. Q. Assuming that she had been injured on the 9th day of January, 1956, and assuming that her right shoulder and arm went down into a doff box and she twisted her body and that she had back pains and reported this fact to her supervisor and that the pains became worse until the day she saw you, would you say in your opinion that this accident she had caused the disc to protrude or greatly aggravated it? A. Well, assuming all of that, and assuming that this disc was so soft that it could be pulled out through the right side, and that it did not have any calcium in it, why then I would say that probably the injury caused it, that is the one in January, because she said she had had a lot of trouble since that time. Q. She had had a lot of trouble with her back since that time? A. Yes, sir, she started having pains almost immediately down her right leg or rather her left leg, she said she had very severe pains in her hip and right leg. Q. I believe you stated that she reported to you that she had had a previous back injury back during World War No. Two? A. In the past history she stated that her ovaries and tubes had been removed fifteen years ago. And she had a hysterectomy four years ago, she had no children and has never been pregnant, she stated that she strained her back in the dye plant at Riegel during World War No. Two and was off from work for a month. . . (Cross-examination) . . . Q. Now then, could you tell from the examination you gave Mrs. Craig, disregarding anything she may have told you, when her difficulty first occurred, could you be sure as to when her trouble first occurred? A. Well, you can tell on certain patients if you had an injury and a disc slipped beyond the spinal canal, if you had had this protruding disc for three years, it is very hard and firm, and you would wonder why they were not operated on three years ago. Q. Let me ask you this, did Roxie Craig tell you that she had had back pains for a period of twenty years? A. She stated that she strained her back, I believe about 1945, she said during World War Two. Q. Did she tell you about having back pains for a period of twenty years? A. No, sir. Q. Did she tell you that about four years ago, or a little over three years ago her back pains became worse and she had medical and chiropractic treatment for it at that time? A. No, sir, Q. Did she tell you that she had fallen about thirty years ago? A. No, sir. Q. Now then, Doctor, if her accident had occurred on January 9, as you mentioned and she described to you, if this injury had happened to her back, do you believe she would not have suffered, and she could not have worked for eight straight months without any time lost on account of it? A. Well, I wouldn't think--I don't know when this injury occurred than she complained about and her disability and she couldn't move and was numb in both legs and she had pain in both legs, I feel like this tremendous injury or rupture may have occurred sometime in a month before I saw her in January, by it switching from her right side to the left. Q. Would the history of twenty years of back pains and it becoming worse four years ago and this combined with the fall and the hurting of her back during World War Two, wouldn't that indicate to you that Mrs. Craig had had some trouble with her disc several years ago? A. It is possible that she may have had a mild disc dislocation, but I wouldn't think it could have gone along that long, what I stated when I saw her, that was a completely impossible situation and it was almost an emergency. Q. Isn't it true, Doctor, that disc could occur rather mild and then over a period of years become worse, in fact isn't that the usual thing? A. In many patients it is the usual thing, yes, sir. Q. Yes, sir. A. It is possible, entirely possible, and then on the other hand it is not entirely possible for one to go with a complication like that for very long without seeking some kind of relief or treatment, but that is not like the situation she had on the 16th of October, 1956. Q. If she had that same situation on January 9, 1956, do you not believe that she would have sought medical treatment and would have lost some time from work sooner than eight months after it happened. A. She saw Dr. Norton in March. Q. That was three months later. A. Two months later. Q. Two months later? A. Yes, sir, according to this report. Q. Two months later then, according to your records? A. Yes, sir, and she also reported it to her supervisor. Q. Doctor, let me ask you this, as to her con-</div><div class="casepar">dition at the time you first saw her in October do you think she could have worked in that condition for eight months without any loss of time? A. I think it got worse. Q. Yes, sir. A. I think her condition continued to get worse over the months after the accident, because the pain she had switched in her legs, it was in her left leg and then in June it went to her right leg, it slipped around, and I feel that it slipped to one side and then to the other in the canal and when it turned back, it went into the spinal canal. Q. Isn't it true, Doctor, to say this, that where a person had back trouble back for a period of twenty years and at times it was bad and at other times not so bad and later turned up with a ruptured disc like this, is it impossible to say when she had the trouble, or I mean when the trouble began? A. Yes, sir, well--that is true, you have to go on the patient's history of their injury and I go into their previous injuries, if any and I try to go over this very carefully and try to get it down right the first time. Q. Would it make any difference in your opinion about when this occurred that she had this prior back pain for twenty years in her body and that it became worse four years ago? A. Assuming that she had trouble five years ago, I knew that much, some people have aches in their backs all their lives, and they don't have ruptured discs, yes, sir, I think it would make some difference when she had other back trouble, whether it was five years before or one year previous to this time, yes, sir, I would take that into account. Q. You don't know about her previous fifteen years of back trouble then? A. No, sir, when she came in and told me about these leg pains and numbness, I tried to go into it very carefully with her. Q. At the time you talked with her, did you ask her if she had been having any back pains before that time? A. I always ask everybody about that, yes, sir. Q. She didn't tell you about the incident where her back became worse three or four years before she came to see you? A. No, sir. . . (Direct examination) . . . Q. I believe you stated, when Mr. Smith talked about it might have happened twenty-five years ago, and I believe you said that when you performed this operation on her, for this protruding disc, did you find any calcified matter? A. Yes, sir, and I would like to clarify this, on an operation like this, it ordinarily takes thirty-five to fifty minutes, and on this particular one, it took over two hours, that is actual working time on the disc, and for that reason, I didn't go into the whole entire left side as on both sides, one which can be done, in many cases, but she was not in condition, she was in poor physical condition, and I did not think she could stand both sides, at one time, but I believe she will have to be operated on her left side at a later time, but that can be done later. (Cross-examination) Q. In answer to his question, I understood you to say that you could not be certain when this disc first ruptured, you didn't mean to change that statement, did you Doctor? A. No, sir, I just felt that this injury occurred in the recent past. Q. And by that, do you mean within the last few months, or in the last three or four months, or last two or three months? A. It occurred, it is hard to tell when the disc slipped to one side, it did not catch a nerve and did not cause any leg pain at the time, it did not get under a nerve route and did not get under a central disc, I believe that central disc causes more back pain and stiffness than anything else, you see, it is in the middle lane and the nerve route is off to each side. And it is in a tunnel really."</div><div class="casepar">Dr. Augustus McCravey, who examined the claimant after her operation and at the instance of the defendant, testified that from his examination and from the history of the claimant given by her and the history brought out at the hearing, he was of the opinion that the claimant's fall on January 9, 1956, greatly aggravated a pre-existing condition.</div><div class="casepar"> J. The single deputy director and the full board found that the claimant had failed to prove that the fall she suffered on January 9, 1956, caused or contributed to the herniated disc which was corrected by surgery. We think that the evidence demanded a finding that the claimant's fall on January 9, 1956, at least aggravated the herniated disc which was corrected by Dr. Kimsey. Irrespective of the claimant's testimony that she had over a period of years suffered from back pains and that she had had two previous falls which injured her back, she testified that she experienced pain at the time of her fall; that her pain had been greater since her fall; that she had experienced since the fall a pain in the legs which she had not experienced previously and that she did not experience any difficulty prior to her fall in reaching to the floor but had experienced such difficulty since the fall.</div><div class="casepar">The testimony of the claimant, and the testimony of Dr. McCravey to the effect that the claimant's fall greatly contributed to a pre-existing back condition, demanded a finding that the claimant's fall on January 9, 1956, at least aggravated her condition which was partially corrected by Dr. Kimsey in October of 1956 and for which compensation is sought.</div><div class="casepar">The fact that the claimant sought medical attention from doctors of her own choice and did not consult with the defendant concerning her operation would not bar her from recovering compensation.
