Before Judge Davis. LaGrange City Court. July 31, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">FELTON, C.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">The petition stated a cause of action against the defendant partners for the tortious misconduct or mistreatment of the plaintiff, an invitee on the defendant's premises, by one of the defendants acting on behalf of himself and as agent of the other two defendants and within the scope of the partnership business; therefore, the court did not err in overruling the general and special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">Mrs. Mattie Ruth Mobley sued Alfred Mansour, George Mansour and Nasor Mansour, Jr., for damages for an alleged tort. The plaintiff alleged the following: "2. That at all times hereinafter mentioned, the defendants were and still are engaged in operating as a partnership, a department store at #25-26 West Court Square, in the City of LaGrange, Troup County, Georgia, under the name and style of 'Mansour's Department Store,' a retail establishment wherein the general public is invited to come for the purpose of buying and doing business with defendants, to defendants' profit.</div><div class="casepar">3. That, on the 8th day of February, 1957, between the hours of 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., plaintiff, accompanied by a friend, Mrs. Bonnie McCollough, was lawfully in said Mansour's Department Store, as an invitee and customer, plaintiff going into said store for the purpose of making purchases. 4. That, on the said date, the defendants, operating as Mansour's Department Store, were having a sale, advertised as a 'remodeling sale.' 5. That, plaintiff and Mrs. McCollough entered Mansour's Department Store at the rear entrance, from the parking lot provided for patrons of the store, and went into the 'basement store', a department of Mansour's Department Store, where Mrs. McCollough made certain purchases. They then proceeded up the stairway to the main or street floor, and to the women's dress department of said department store, where they examined some merchandise plaintiff intended buying. 6. That George Mansour, one of the defendants herein, followed your plaintiff and Mrs. McCollough upstairs to the main floor. 7. That while plaintiff was choosing the merchandise in the women's dress department she wished to buy, the said George Mansour, called out at the petitioner in a loud, angry and accusing voice, 'Hey, you Come back here a minute' The defendant, George Mansour, was pointing his finger at plaintiff as he spoke. Said remarks humiliated, startled and embarrassed petitioner. 8. That defendant, George Mansour, spoke to your plaintiff, as alleged in paragraph seven above, with the deliberate intent to intimidate, humiliate and embarrass the plaintiff, speaking in a loud, angry and hostile voice, so that all persons in the store could hear and did hear him, and attracted their attention to your plaintiff. 9. That February 8th, 1957, was a Friday, and as a result of the 'remodeling sale,' Mansour's Department Store was crowded with people. 10. That defendant, George Mansour, then called to J. B. Bowles, an employee of defendants, who came hurriedly, and the said J. B. Bowles and George Mansour, led plaintiff in clear view of all persons in the store, from the women's dress department, through the shoe department, and into a stock room, in the extreme rear portion of the building. 11. That such conduct on the part of the defendant, George Mansour, made a public spectacle of plaintiff and caused her to suffer extreme embarrassment and humiliation. 12. That said stock room is partitioned off and separated from the sales area of said store. 13. That there was no exit to the said stock room, except for one door, and the said J. B. Bowles, acting under the orders of defendant, George Mansour, stood in said only exit, blocking and guarding said exit with his body, so as to prevent plaintiff from leaving. 14. That George Mansour, unlawfully detained and restrained plaintiff, against her will, and held her in his custody while he questioned her. 15. That, while plaintiff was so unlawfully detained, defendant, George Mansour, insisted that plaintiff had some articles in her possession that had not been paid for, and by innuendo, defendant, George Mansour, called plaintiff a common thief, a shoplifter and accused her of committing the criminal offense of larceny. Defendant, George Mansour, demanded of plaintiff: 'Don't you have something you want to pay for?' Plaintiff answered: 'What?' Defendant, George Mansour then stated: 'You know</div><div class="casepar">what it is You have it there' pointing to plaintiff's bag (pocketbook). Plaintiff replied: 'Here is my bag. Look in it.' Plaintiff then opened the pocketbook and defendant, George Mansour, looked in it and found nothing belonging to the store, or to the defendants. 16. Plaintiff shows that while she was illegally detained, the defendants' employee, J. B. Bowles, was in their immediate presence, guarding; and blocking the only exit from the stock room where plaintiff was confined, and where the inquisition took place; and that said J. B. Bowles heard all of the defamatory remarks made by the defendant, George Mansour, which are slanderous per se. 17. Plaintiff shows that as a result of said inquisition she was in a state of shock, and was dazed and frightened; that upon her release from said stock room, she was extremely excited, became sick and faint; that plaintiff went all to pieces and feared that she would have a heart attack; that plaintiff, being dazed to unsteadiness on her feet, started towards the front entrance of the main floor, when she was rejoined by her companion, Mrs. McCollough. Mrs. McCollough helped plaintiff to the stairway leading to the rear basement exit and parking lot, where they had parked the car. 18. Plaintiff shows that said slanderous and defamatory accusations made by defendant, George Mansour, were utterly false and untrue, and that plaintiff has in no way been guilty of the acts charged and imputed to her; that defendant Mansour's said conduct as set forth above was recklessly, wilfully and wantonly done. 19. Plaintiff shows that said acts were committed by defendant, George Mansour, one of the partners, as agent of said partnership, while acting within the scope of the partnership business and in furtherance of said partnership business, and for the common interest of all said partners, who are named defendants herein . . . 24. Plaintiff shows that defendants were bound by ordinary care not to wilfully and wantonly injure plaintiff while she was lawfully in their store, as an invitee. But because of said wrongful, tortious and wilful and wanton acts, done, plaintiff did and will continue to suffer the loss of peace and happiness and caused her to suffer great embarrassment and wounded severely her feelings. 25. That as a result of the wilful violation of the rights of plaintiff as an invitee in defendants' store, plaintiff claims general damages in the sum of $25,000. 26. Plaintiff claims punitive damages, by reason of aggravation in the acts and intentions of the defendants as hereinbefore set out, in the sum of $100,000 to deter the defendants from repeating the said wrongful and malicious tort against your plaintiff. 27. That, as a result of the bad faith of the defendants, plaintiff is entitled to recover expenses of litigation in the sum of $11,000 against defendants; that said $11,000 alleged as expense of litigation covers attorneys fees in the sum of $10,000 for the purpose of prosecuting this suit, which plaintiff alleges is reasonable, and expenses of taking depositions in the amount of $1,000, which petitioner alleges is reasonable."</div><div class="casepar">The defendants filed separate general and special demurrers which were overruled and they except.</div><div class="casepar">(b) The contention of the defendants Alfred Mansour and Nasor Mansour, Jr., that they were not liable for the acts of their partners is without merit. "A partnership in the conduct of its business is a legal entity both as to its rights and in the performance of its duties to the public and to its employees, and is a legal entity as to its obligations. Partners are, in respect to the business in which they are engaged, agents of each other, and therefore one partner might be liable for the tortious acts of another done in the usual course of business of the firm." Zakas Bakery v. Lipes, <span class="casemissing">27 Ga. App. 712</span>, 715 (109 S. E. 537). "We think the proper construction of section 75-308 is that partners are not responsible for the torts of each other merely by reason of their relation as partners, and that in order for such liability to exist the wrong must have been committed within the legitimate scope of the partnership business." Rogers v. Carmichael, <span class="casemissing">184 Ga. 496</span>, 504 (192 S. E. 39).</div><div class="casepar">Even if the court had stricken, on special demurrer, the allegations relating to the unlawful detention, which we will consider below, the petition would still have stated a good cause of action based on the acts of slanderous accusations.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special demurrers 3, 4, 5, and 6 are clearly without merit.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special demurrer 7 attacks that part of paragraph 11 of the petition which alleges "that such conduct on the part of the defendant, George Mansour, made a public spectacle of the plaintiff, upon the ground that the allegation constitutes a conclusion of the pleader and is prejudicial." This demurrer is without merit. Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d ed., defines "Spectacle" as being a "show, sight, exhibition"; something "unusual and notable." We think that from the facts and circumstances alleged, the word "spectacle" describes the position in which the plaintiff was placed.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special demurrer 13 to that portion of paragraph 15 which alleged "by innuendo, defendant, George Mansour, called plaintiff a common thief, a shoplifter and accused her of committing the criminal offense of larceny" upon the ground that such allegation constituted a conclusion of the pleader and was prejudicial is without merit. The conclusion is inescapable that the statements made by George Mansour to the plaintiff as alleged in paragraph 15 amounted to an accusation that the plaintiff was a thief and guilty of the offense of larceny. For the same reason, special demurrers 18 and 20 are without merit. Colonial Stores, Inc. v. Coker, <span class="casemissing">74 Ga. App. 264</span> (1a) supra.</div><div class="casepar">5. Special demurrer 17 attacks the use of the word "Inquisition" in paragraphs 16 and 17. The demurrer is without merit. Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, defines "Inquisition" as being "an act or instance of inquiring." The word is further defined as meaning "inquiry; search; examination; investigation."</div><div class="casepar">6. Special demurrer 21, which attacks that portion of paragraph 18 which alleges "plaintiff has in no way been guilty of the acts charged and imputed to her," on the ground that the plaintiff fails to allege what acts were charged and imputed to her, is without merit as it is quite clear that she was charged by George Mansour with being guilty of the act of larceny.</div><div class="casepar">7. Special demurrer 22 is without merit. The allegation in paragraph 19 "that said acts were committed by defendant George Mansour, one of the partners, as agent of said partnership, while acting within the scope of the partnership business and in furtherance of said partnership business, and for the common interest of all said partners" is a sufficient allegation as to scope of employment or agency. Southern Grocery Stores v. Keys, <span class="casemissing">70 Ga. App. 473</span>, supra.</div><div class="casepar">8. The writer does not agree with the majority opinion of the court as to the disposition of grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of the special demurrer to the petition. The majority opinion contained in the succeeding divisions is in the language of Quillian, J.</div><div class="casepar">9. Special ground 8 attacks the allegation that the servant of the defendant partnership did a particular act while "acting under the orders of a member of the partnership." The objection to the allegation was that the terms and context of the orders were not set forth. The petition fully related the circumstances under which the orders were given the servant. It was not necessary to set forth the exact language in which the orders were couched. In Atlantic Company v. Taylor, <span class="casemissing">80 Ga. App. 25</span>, 30 (54 S. E. 2d 910) it is held: "The court did not err in overruling the general or special demurrers to the first count of the petition. The allegations are sufficient to allege that the plaintiff was an invitee on the truck, engaged in an undertaking of mutual benefit to him and the defendant. The allegation, that 'said Anderson had authority to permit and allow plaintiff to assist in the operation of the truck,' is not a conclusion but is an allegation of an ultimate fact. It was not necessary to allege the evidence by which the allegation would be proved. The same ruling applies to the allegation that Anderson 'was acting within the scope of his employment in inviting, permitting, and allowing the plaintiff to assist in the operation of the truck, and in the loading and unloading of the truck,' " would be sought to be proved. That the allegation was sufficiently explicit appears from the holdings in Kiser Co. v. Podrick, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 642</span>, 645 (118 S. E. 791). 10. Grounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of the special demurrer attack allegations of the petition that the plaintiff was deprived of her liberty, because there was no averment that she made any physical effort to escape from a stock room into which she was led by a member of the defendant partnership and an employee of the defendant under the partner's directions.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleges that one of the partners of the defendant partnership, and an employee of the partnership, summoned by the partner led the plaintiff from the part of the store she had voluntarily entered, through another department and into a stock room at the end of the building; that "a door was" the only exit from the stock room; that the employee acting under orders given him by the partner "stood in the exit, blocking and guarding said exit with his body, so as to prevent plaintiff from leaving." Upon these averments was predicated the further averment that the plaintiff was restrained of her liberty.</div><div class="casepar">In Sinclair Refining Co. v. Meek, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. App. 850</span>, 854 (10 S. E. 2d 76) it is held: "We now come to the question raised in the main bill of exceptions by the defendant corporation, whether the judge erred in overruling the general demurrer to count 1 of the petition. The action in this count is for 'malicious trespass and false imprisonment.' 25 C. J. 545,  11, declares that 'The restraint constituting a false imprisonment may arise out of words, acts, gestures or the like, which induce a reasonable apprehension that force will be used if plaintiff does not submit; and it is sufficient if they operate upon the will of the person threatened, and result in a reasonable fear of personal difficulty or personal injuries.' Our Supreme Court in Westberry v. Clanton, <span class="casemissing">136 Ga. 795</span> (72 S. E. 238) held: 'False imprisonment at common law, and elsewhere, consists in the unlawful detention of the person of another, for any length of time, whereby he is deprived of his personal liberty (3 Bl. Com. 127; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 721; 19 Cyc. 319; Civil Code (1910),  4447, which is a codification of the common law), and furnishes a right of action for damages to the person so detained." The grounds of demurrer referred to are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in overruling the general demurrer and special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">FELTON, C. J., dissenting. I concur in all of the rulings except that I dissent from the judgment of affirmance and in the rulings on special demurrers 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 19 which demurrers are as follows: "8. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 13 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges . . . and the said J. B. Bowles acting under the orders of defendant, George Mansour . . . upon the grounds that plaintiff fails to set forth the terms or context of such orders, if any, and when the same were given by said defendant to the said J. B. Bowles. 9. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 13 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges that said exit was blocked so as to prevent plaintiff from leaving upon the grounds that plaintiff fails to allege that she, at any time pertinent hereto, tried, attempted or sought to leave and was prevented by the actions of this defendant from so doing. 10. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 14 of said petition upon the ground that said paragraph fails to allege how and in what manner she was detained and restrained. 11. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 14 of said petition upon the ground that plaintiff in said paragraph fails to allege how the defendant, George Mansour, held plaintiff in his custody. 12. Defendant demurs specially to paragraphs 14 and 15 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleged that she was unlawfully detained upon the ground that such allegation constitutes a conclusion of the pleader and is prejudicial to this defendant and should be stricken from the petition. 14. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 16 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges that 'she was illegally detained' upon the ground that the same constitutes a conclusion of the pleader and should be stricken from the petition. 15. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 16 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges that 'the defendant's employee, J. B. Bowles, was in their immediate presence guarding and blocking the only exit from the stock room' in that plaintiff fails to allege how near or how far said employee was from the plaintiff and in what manner said employee was guarding and blocking said exit and how said employee manifested such guarding and blocking to plaintiff. 16. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 16 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges 'where plaintiff was confined' upon the ground that plaintiff fails to allege how and in what manner she was confined, whether she ever at any time attempted to leave and was prevented from so doing and if so, by whom and in what manner she was prevented from leaving. 19. Defendant demurs specially to paragraph 17 of said petition wherein plaintiff alleges 'that upon her release from said stock room' upon the ground that plaintiff fails to allege that she was being held against her will, by whom she was being held, in what manner she was being held, that she attempted to leave and was prevented from doing so and by whom and in what manner she was prevented from leaving and by whom and in what manner she was released."</div><div class="casepar">The defendant is entitled to the information called for in each of these special demurrers, without which the allegations attacked are conclusions of the pleader. None of the authorities cited by the majority in support of its rulings on these demurrers supports the rulings, in my opinion.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Thomasson &amp; Thomasson, Houston White, J.
