Before Judge Whitman. Fulton Superior Court. July 22, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">QUILLIAN, J.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">1. A collecting agency empowered by a patron to collect a claim is authorized to employ an attorney to institute suit on the claim in behalf of the client. The patron becomes the attorney's client, and for his conduct the patron is as much responsible as if he had employed the attorney in the first instance instead of engaging the services of the collecting agency.</div><div class="casepar">2. The holdings in all of the divisions of the opinion except the first being brief, there is no need of headnotes corresponding in number to them.</div><div class="casepar">The Chamberlin Company engaged a Detroit collecting agency to collect a debt due it by E. L. Mays of Stockbridge, Georgia. The contract of employment authorized the agency to file suit on the claim, to employ an Atlanta agency to assist in making the collection, and to transmit to the latter agency all authority conferred upon the former. The Atlanta agency employed a lawyer. The lawyer filed suit, obtained a judgment against E. L. Mays, and had an execution issued against him. He obtained some information that E. L. Mays lived in an apartment at 430 Pool Creek Road, visited the apartment and conversed with the maid. While at the apartment he espied certain articles of furniture, but made no inquiry or investigation to learn to whom they belonged. While his version of the conversation quoted the maid as saying Mr. Mays would be home at a given hour, the maid stoutly maintained that she told the lawyer that Mrs. Mays would return at that hour. Assuming that Mays was the head of the household in the apartment, he acted upon the presumption that Mays owned the articles of furniture. Though the tax records and other sources of information were available to him he sought no correct information from any source.</div><div class="casepar">In these circumstances he ordered the furniture of the plaintiff, Mrs. Flo Mays, levied on; It was seized and publicly removed from her premises in the presence of neighbors and strangers. The next day Mrs. Mays' attorney informed him that E. L. Mays did not live in the apartment at 430 Pool Creek Road, that Mrs. Mays owned the furniture; that it had been purchased on the instalment plan and that a named store held a conditional-sale contract to the furniture by which the balance due on its purchase price was secured. The attorney refused to dismiss the levy, forced Mrs. Mays to file a claim and give bond in order to obtain possession of her chattels and compelled her to litigate the claim until her claim of title was vindicated by a judgment rendered in the claim case. The public seizure and litigation caused Mrs. Mays shock that resulted in detriment to her health and caused her physical pain. Whereupon the plaintiff, Mrs. Flo Mays, sued Chamberlin Company of America for damages in the Superior Court of Fulton County. Her cause was the abuse of legal process. The petition prayed for actual damages caused by the levy, damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages. The defendant demurred to the petition, and excepted to a judgment overruling the demurrer. On the appearance of the case here the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Chamberlin Company of America v. Mays, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../700/79/index.html">92 Ga. App. 173</a></span> (88 S. E. 2d 176). The case came on for trial and the facts related in reference to the levy and its consequences were shown by the evidence. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial on the general grounds and added special grounds by amendment. The defendant also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Both motions were denied, the defendant excepted, and the case is here for review.</div><div class="casepar"> We shall refer to the plaintiff in error as the defendant and the defendant in error as the plaintiff.</div><div class="casepar">1. Grounds 4 and 5 of the motion for new trial complain that the judge charged the jury: "The court does not intend to intimate or express to you, by anything stated in the charge any opinion as to any disputed facts in the case, nor as to who should recover in the case; these questions being exclusively for you gentlemen to determine, except that the court charges you that the alleged levy of the execution, as shown by the evidence in the case, was illegal and the seizure of these items of personal property under levy and their removal from the place at which the levy was made was illegal, and acts which, in law, were wrongful insofar as the plaintiff is concerned, and that the defendant in this case is responsible and liable to the plaintiff in respect of such wrongful levy, seizure and removal of these three items of personal property thereunder."</div><div class="casepar">The exception taken to the charge is that it in effect instructed the jury that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for procuring and prosecuting a levy on her property without probable cause, when the issues should have been submitted to the jury as to whether the attorney who ordered and litigated the levy was authorized to represent the defendant in the proceedings, and as to whether the levy was in good faith and upon probable cause.</div><div class="casepar">The Atlanta agency was vested with authority to retain a lawyer to handle the litigation necessary to collect the debt. This is true because the collecting agency could not institute a suit on behalf of the defendant. Actions in the courts must be brought by the plaintiff in person or through an attorney at law. Necessary for the purpose of bringing the suit was the employment of a lawyer. Applicable is the provision of Code  4-301.</div><div class="casepar">But it is immaterial whether the Atlanta agency was authorized to sue the claim, since it is conceded that it was empowered to collect it. "Where an agency is created for the performance of an act beneficial to the principal, all the usual modes and means of accomplishing the objects of the agency are included in its creation, unless the contrary clearly appears. Accordingly, where one holding a promissory note against another, with a claim on certain land as security, sends the note and papers evidencing her claim to a collecting agency, a power is created in the latter to procure the services of an attorney, if necessary, to collect the note and enforce the security." Strong v. West, <span class="casemissing">110 Ga. 382 (1)</span> (35 S. E. 693).</div><div class="casepar">The attorney who procured and prosecuted the levy and the owner of the Atlanta collecting agency both protested that he was retained merely as counsel for the agency. The assertion is not tenable. When a collecting agency employs a lawyer to handle the claim of a patron, the patron becomes the lawyer's client.</div><div class="casepar">The attorney testified that he was given no directions when the collecting agency turned the debt due by Mays to the defendant for collection. When a lawyer is employed to collect a demand of his client, the employment involves authority to effect the collection through appropriate litigation of the claim. The evidence demanded the conclusion that the attorney who ordered and prosecuted the levy was fully authorized to represent the defendant. Having determined that the charge correctly instructed the jury that the defendant was liable for the acts of the attorney, we must now decide whether what he did was as a matter of law actionable. It is held in Orr v. Floyd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../694/11/index.html">95 Ga. App. 401</a></span>, 405 (97 S. E. 2d 920): "Where one causes a levy to be made on the property in the possession of and belonging to a person not the defendant in fi. fa. without probable cause, he is a trespasser even though the levy was directed by his attorney (Atlantic Co. v. Farris, <span class="casemissing">62 Ga. App. 212</span>, 215 (1), 8 S. E. 2d 665), and if the attorney causes such levy to be made without probable cause, he is a joint trespasser with his client. Williams v. Inman, <span class="casemissing">1 Ga. App. 321</span> (1c) (57 S. E. 1009)."</div><div class="casepar">The ingredients of a cause for malicious abuse of process is the procurement and prosecution of the process maliciously and without probable cause to the hurt of another. Both lack of probable cause and malice are essential elements. Atlanta Hub Co. v. Bussey, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../698/14/index.html">93 Ga. App. 171</a></span>, 177 (91 S. E. 2d 66); Georgia Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Johnston, <span class="casemissing">116 Ga. 628</span> (43 S. E. 27). But it is held in Orr v. Floyd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../694/11/index.html">95 Ga. App. 401 (3)</a></span>, supra: "Malice may be inferred from the want of probable cause or from a seizure made in a manner to indicate a wanton disregard of the rights of the true owner."</div><div class="casepar">The uncontradicted evidence showed that the defendant's debtor, E. L. Mays, did not reside at the same address and in the apartment occupied by the plaintiff. The defendant's attorney went to the apartment and according to his testimony was advised by the maid that E. L. Mays would return in the evening. While there he espied certain articles of furniture in the apartment. The attorney made no further inquiry or investigation as to whom the articles belonged. There was available to him sources of information from which he could have ascertained who in fact owned the articles. However, he elected to rely upon his own assumption that E. L. Mays, his client's debtor, was the head of a household dwelling in the apartment he had visited, and the legal presumption that chattels found in a home are owned by the head of the household. The levy was ordered and made on the articles, which were not owned by E. L. Mays who did not reside in the apartment, but were the property of the plaintiff who lived in the apartment. On the next day the defendant's attorney was advised by the plaintiff's attorney of her ownership, and informed him that the chattels had been purchased by her from a local store; that the purchase had been made on credit and that the balance due the store was secured by a conditional-sale contract. The defendant's attorney refused to dismiss the levy, forced the plaintiff to file a claim, and give bond in order to repossess the chattels, and continued to prosecute the levy until the plaintiff vindicated her title on the trial of the claim case.</div><div class="casepar">Under the facts disclosed by the record it must be held that the finding was demanded that the levy was without probable cause, malicious and oppressive. The grounds show no error.</div><div class="casepar">2. Ground 6 complains that the court charged the jury that the answer neither admitted nor denied certain allegations of the petition, when the allegations were in fact denied in the answer as amended. The judge instructed the jury that the averments referred to were denied by the amendment to the answer. The ground shows no inaccuracy or error in the charge.</div><div class="casepar">3. Ground 7 complains that the court submitted the issue as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for pain and suffering.</div><div class="casepar">The exceptions to the charge were: (a) that the cause was not of a nature in which there could be a recovery for pain and suffering; (b) because there was no evidence that the plaintiff was caused physical pain by the act of the defendant or one for whose acts the defendant was liable.</div><div class="casepar">The first exception is disposed of adversely to the defendant by the ruling made by this court on the previous appearance of the case here. Chamberlin Company of America v. Mays, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../700/79/index.html">92 Ga. App. 173</a></span> (88 S. E. 2d 176).</div><div class="casepar">The second exception is not well taken because there was ample proof that the plaintiff's health was impaired and she was caused physical pain by the wrong committed by the defendant.</div><div class="casepar">4. Ground 8 asserts that for various reasons the court erred in submitting to the jury the issue as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages. The specific criticisms made were: (a) that there was no evidence to warrant the charge; (b) that the charge was not authorized by the pleadings; (c) that the charge was confused and inappropriate; (d) that the charge failed to instruct the jury as to the burden of proof respecting the recovery of punitive damages; (e) that the charge as to the method of arriving at the amount or measuring punitive damages was incorrect.</div><div class="casepar">The pleadings, according to the opinion of this court on the former appearance of the case here, set forth a cause for recovery of punitive damages. The evidence authorized the finding that the defendant acted maliciously, oppressively, and without probable cause in ordering and prosecuting the wrongful levy on the plaintiff's chattels.</div><div class="casepar">Subheads (a) and (b) show no error.</div><div class="casepar">The charge was not inappropriate or confused, but was applicable to the issues of the case and a model of clarity. Subhead exception (c) shows no error.</div><div class="casepar">There was no request to charge on the burden of proof, and, in the absence of a written request, it is not error for the court not to instruct the jury concerning the proof, or the preponderance of the evidence. Southern Ry. Co. v. Wright, <span class="casemissing">6 Ga. App. 172 (2)</span> (64 S. E. 703); Southern Ry. Co. v. Wilcox, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. App. 785</span> (2 S. E. 2d 225); Jackson v. Sanders, <span class="casemissing">199 Ga. 222</span>, 228 (33 S. E. 2d 711, 159 A. L. R. 638); Palmer v. Hinson, <span class="casemissing">201 Ga. 654</span>, 658 (40 S. E. 2d 526). Subhead exception (d) shows no error.</div><div class="casepar">While the charge explicitly instructed the jury as to the manner of arriving at whether and in what amount punitive damages should be awarded, if it had failed to do so that imperfection would not have been properly reached by subhead exception (e) which failed to set out literally or in substance what the court should have charged. Spence v. Morrow, <span class="casemissing">128 Ga. 722 (1)</span> (58 S. E. 356). Subhead (e) shows no error.</div><div class="casepar">Grounds 9 and 10 object to the admission of documents vital to the issues of the case because they were irrelevant and not sufficiently identified. The evidence centered around the documents, they were relevant and definitely identified. Neither ground shows error.</div><div class="casepar">5. Under the ruling made in the preceding divisions of the opinion there was no error in denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
