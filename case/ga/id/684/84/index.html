Plaintiff further alleged than the defendant Clyde Owen, through his agent, had advised plaintiff that he was procuring a loan for him and that plaintiff relied upon the false statements and representations made by the defendants; that in fact the instrument that he signed in blank was not a loan instrument but was a conditional-sale contract and that through said fraud he was damaged in the sum of $203.19.</div><div class="casepar">The petition further alleged that the plaintiff paid to the defendant Sterling Discount Corporation the sum of $207.67 for the use of $715.85 for a period of one month and six days, but that "had he been allowed" to procure his loan from the First National Bank of Atlanta, the interest for said period would have amounted to $4.48, and he was therefore defrauded of the sum of $203.19.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff also sought to recover $2,000 as attorneys' fees and $150,000 as punitive damages.</div><div class="casepar">After further discussion, the salesman, having been told by the plaintiff that he would not want to pay more than $50 per month, and after referring to a rate book, stated that the monthly payments, including insurance and after allowance of $1,100 for the Chevrolet, would be $46.76 for twenty-four months, which was understood and agreed to by the plaintiff. The salesman then asked numerous questions for credit purposes and filled in a purchaser's statement which was signed by the plaintiff. Thereafter, the plaintiff signed in blank a purchase money note, conditional-sale contract, recording certificate and insurance authorization, whereupon he left the used car lot.</div><div class="casepar">Within a week the plaintiff received from Sterling Discount Corporation a payment schedule book calling for twenty-four monthly payments of $46.76 and some insurance policies on the automobile. Thereafter, he made two monthly payments totaling $93.52 to Sterling Discount Corporation prior to the time said instalments became due. On September 25, 1957, the plaintiff, desirous of selling the Oldsmobile, paid Sterling Discount Corporation $830 in satisfaction of all obligations due.</div><div class="casepar">The original "time price balance" under the conditional-sale contract was $1,122.24, including premiums of $169 for insurance coverages. The balance due on September 25, 1957, was $1,028.72, against which was credited a rebate of insurance premiums in the amount of $150.52 and a "voluntary discount" of $48.20 by Sterling Discount Corporation, leaving the $830 balance, which plaintiff paid off.</div><div class="casepar">At the close of the plaintiff's evidence, the judge granted a motion for nonsuit by each of the defendants, to which ruling exception is taken.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff alleges that he was defrauded by the defendants of $203.19, being the difference between $207.67, allegedly paid to defendant Sterling Discount Corporation for the use of $715.85 for a period of one month and six days, and $4.48 alleged interest charge at "bank rates" for the same period. At the outset, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the plaintiff paid $207.67 or any other amount for the use of $715.85, as alleged in his petition. The evidence simply shows that the plaintiff could have purchased the 1955 Oldsmobile for a cash price of $715.85, plus trade-in allowance, but chose instead to finance the purchase on a time-price basis, thereby agreeing to pay a "time-price balance" of $1,122.24, plus trade-in allowance. Construing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff, it does indicate that this balance included a charge of $169 for insurance premiums, but there is nothing to show that any portion of the time-price balance represented a charge for the use of the cash-price amount.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff testified that he agreed to pay twenty-four monthly instalments of $46.76 each (total $1,122.24); that this agreement was entered into "voluntarily"; he was "satisfied with it"; the conditional-sale contract signed by him in blank was later completed in accordance with the terms of the previous agreement; he knew it was a "title-retention contract" and understood that Clyde Owen or his transferee "would hold legal title to that automobile" while any instalments remained unpaid. The evidence is plainly insufficient to support the plaintiff's allegations that he never intended to purchase a car for a time-price but understood that the balance was $715.85, particularly since the conditional-sale contract signed by him shows on its face that it is "on a time-price basis" and makes several other references to the time-price feature.</div><div class="casepar">Assuming the plaintiff's contention that he could have obtained a loan of $715.85 from the First National Bank of Atlanta in August, 1957, there is no evidence to indicate what the total charges on such a loan would have been for the time in question. Mr. Overton, the only witness connected with the bank, testified that various sorts of insurance coverage were generally required in automobile loan transactions, but there is no evidence as to the amount of premiums involved and whether such premiums were required to be paid by instalments to the bank together with principal and interest. Moreover, there is no evidence as to whether the notes used by the bank in loans of this type contained any prepayment privilege. Assuming that the plaintiff might have availed himself of some customary method of prepayment, there is nothing to show the manner of computation of any rebate due upon prepayment, since the "seven-eighths method of rebating interest on loans" is not explained by the evidence.</div><div class="casepar">In the final analysis, there is no evidence from which the jury could determine the alleged charges by the defendant Sterling Discount Corporation or the difference between these alleged charges and any possible charges by the First National Bank of Atlanta or other banking institution. It is unnecessary to consider the sufficiency of evidence relating to the alleged conspiracy or to any other matters, since, for the reasons stated, the evidence was insufficient to support the material and necessary allegations of loss to the plaintiff.
