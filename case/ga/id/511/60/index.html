Floyd Superior Court. Before Judge Royal.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">On March 14, 1979, Georgia Power Company initiated an in rem condemnation proceeding against certain real property owned by Camille Hardy Harwell. In this condemnation before a special master pursuant to Code Ann. Chapter 36-6A (Ga. L. 1957, pp. 387, 388; as amended), Georgia Power Company sought "to acquire the unencumbered fee simple title" to 71. 768 acres of land for use in the Rocky Mountain Project, a pump storage project located in Floyd County. The condemnor prayed that "the Court decree and adjudge the absolute fee simple title in and to said property . . . free of lien and encumbrance, to vest in Petitioner."</div><div class="casepar">The project involved in this condemnation proceeding is of a rather unique nature as will be seen from the following findings of fact by the special master:</div><div class="casepar">"The project is located in the northwestern portion of Floyd County, Georgia, and its purpose is to generate electricity which, upon completion of the project, will be sold to customers of Georgia Power Company. The anticipated completion date is in 1982.</div><div class="casepar">"The granting of a license by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is necessary for the construction of such a project. In its application for such license, the applicant is required to show a need for the power and to show what the applicant proposes to do by way of project construction. The company has been granted a license for the construction of the Rocky Mountain Pump Storage Project.</div><div class="casepar">"It is to be a hydroelectric project which will generate electricity by the passing of water through turbine generating machinery. This differs from the conventional project where a dam is constructed on a river and power generation is dependent upon the water flow. A pump storage project depends upon a volume of water which is pumped from a lower reservoir into a higher reservoir during times of low demand, and in times of peak demand the water is released to flow back down to generate electricity. In the Rocky Mountain Pump Storage Project, Heath Creek has a relatively low flow, but will be dammed up to provide a volume of water. The lower reservoir will be divided into three different impoundments: a lower operating pool to cover approximately 400 acres; auxiliary pool No. 1 to cover approximately 387 acres; and auxiliary pool No. 2 to cover approximately 120 acres. The upper operating pool is to be constructed on top of a mountain and will cover approximately 441 acres. The lower operating pool will be located along the base of the mountain, and its normal daily level will fluctuate approximately 29 feet as water is pumped from it and then permitted to flow back into it. Auxiliary pools No. 1 and No. 2 will provide reserve volume which may be released over spillways into the lower operating pool when needed. The levels of the auxiliary pools will remain relatively constant. The waters of Heath Creek will be needed to replace that lost through evaporation and to maintain some flow below the dam. A transmission line will be located at the base of the mountain adjacent to the lower operating pool. It will be the only link between the power house which lies approximately 6000 feet northeasterly of the Harwell property and the switching station which lies approximately 6700 feet southerly of the Harwell property. The transmission line is necessary for the operation of the project. It will lie within 900 feet to the east side of the Harwell property.</div><div class="casepar">"According to the testimony of the power company's hydraulics engineer, the stripping of vegetation off the Harwell property would result in erosion off the steep slopes, this resulting in silt flowing into the lower operating pool and into auxiliary pool No. 2. The silt would reduce the volume available in the reservoir for water and would reduce the generating capacity of the project. He further testified that the property sought to be condemned is needed as a buffer zone to protect project structures from sabotage, that a zone will be a more effective barrier for this purpose than a fence; and that plans call for the power company to be able to exclude all visitors from various areas in order to protect project structures. He further testified that in his opinion the property sought to be condemned is necessary to the power company for security purposes in view of its location with respect to the lower operating pool, the spillway on auxiliary pool No. 1, and the transmission line to be located at the base of the mountain in a position vulnerable to damage from saboteurs who might be located on the Harwell property. He further testified that an access road over the Harwell property is necessary for access from the Fouche Gap Road to the north abutment of the spillway; that the acquisition of air rights is necessary in order that vegetation growth may be permitted so as to provide ground cover; and that the acquisition of mineral rights is necessary in order to prevent access of anyone attempting to remove them. A necessity for the property for security purposes is said to exist during the construction period as well as for access to the spillway during construction. After construction is completed, the property will be allowed to re-vegetate and to return to its natural state in order to minimize erosion.</div><div class="casepar">"Various exhibits introduced into evidence at the hearing reflect various proposed recreational uses over the project area including a visitor's center, picnic areas, boat rentals, concession centers, camping areas, trailer park areas, fishing areas, hiking trails and overlook areas. Under present plans, the power company reserves the right to completely restrict all recreational uses as it might determine to do in cases of strike or civil disobedience. Under the amendment to Exhibit . . ., no recreational facilities are presently planned to be located on the Harwell property. Amendment to Exhibit . . . shows the areas of the Harwell property as the 'area best suited for development.'</div><div class="casepar">"The development of the Harwell property for recreational uses such as camping trailer sites with associated buildings such as a general store and crafts shop is a feasible use of the property according to testimony of a civil engineer and land planner who has prepared a lay out for such development for the Harwells."</div><div class="casepar">Georgia Power Company, as condemnor, set forth in its petition that the acquisition by condemnation of the unencumbered fee simple title to the tract of land described in its petition, together with all appurtenances and improvements located thereon, was required in order to construct, operate and maintain an electric generating plant and other necessary facilities which will become a component part of condemnor's network of generating, transmission and distribution systems for the public purpose of generating, transmitting and distributing electric current to the public generally.</div><div class="casepar">By her responsive pleadings and again at the hearing before the special master Mrs. Harwell, as condemnee, challenged the authority of Georgia Power Company to condemn the fee simple title, the necessity of the taking of the entire tract of land, and the necessity of using the special master procedure. The special master ruled against Mrs. Harwell on these issues, and they along with additional issues were again raised in Mrs. Harwell's exceptions to the return of the special master. The superior court denied each and every exception to the return of the special master and entered judgment awarding Georgia Power Company an unencumbered fee simple title in the tract of land. In its judgment the superior court decreed, ordered, and adjudged "that the unencumbered fee simple title to that certain tract of land . . . 71.768 acres, more or less . . . is hereby condemned in fee simple . . . and . . . [condemnor], and its successors and assigns, are hereby vested with full, complete, and unencumbered fee simple title to all the land, improvements, and appurtenances thereon." (Emphasis supplied.) In the case sub judice the condemnor is not seeking merely a right of way or easement, of a specified width, over condemnee's lands for construction and maintenance of a transmission line or lines but rather is seeking to acquire by condemnation the unencumbered fee simple title to 71.768 acres for the construction, operation and maintenance of a hydroelectric project which will generate electricity for transmission and distribution to the public.</div><div class="casepar">An appeal as to valuation remains pending therefore final judgment has not been entered in this case. See in this regard Hardy v. Ga. Power Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../525/41/index.html">151 Ga. App. 803 (261 SE2d 749)</a></span>. However, this case is properly before this court on interlocutory appeal, permission having been granted after proper application pursuant to Code Ann.  6-701 (a) 2 (Ga. L. 1975, pp. 757, 758). Held:</div><div class="casepar">1. Appellate review of the question of what property interest has been taken is not barred by the last sentence of Code Ann.  36-610a (Ga. L. 1957, pp. 387, 392; 1966, p. 388) which presents the issue by stating: ". . . it being the purpose of this Chapter to, so far as is reasonably possible, protect the rights of all parties to be heard at the time of the hearing before the special master, but that, so far as the right to take or damage the property, or any interest therein, by the condemning body, upon the payment of the amount of the award by the special master into the registry of the court, is concerned, the award of the special master and the judgment of the court condemning the property to the use of the condemning body shall be conclusive." (Emphasis supplied.) Johnson v. Fulton County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../676/56/index.html">103 Ga. App. 873 (121 SE2d 54)</a></span> and Brown v. Ga. Power Co., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../585/72/index.html">134 Ga. App. 784 (216 SE2d 613)</a></span> cited by condemnor are inapposite on the facts. In both cases (Johnson and Brown) the condemnee failed to raise or preserve for appeal the question of what property interest was taken.</div><div class="casepar">That appellate review of the question of what property interest is taken in a condemnation under the special master procedure is allowed when properly raised and preserved has been decided by implication where this question has been considered and decided on appeal. One such case is Heirs of Champion v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../531/24/index.html">149 Ga. App. 470 (254 SE2d 706)</a></span>, reversed on other grounds in City of Atlanta v. Heirs of Champion, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../869/9/index.html">244 Ga. 620 (261 SE2d 343)</a></span>. Note that both appellate courts ruled on the issue of what property interest was taken.</div><div class="casepar">2. The power of eminent domain is inherent in the sovereign state, but lies dormant until granted by act of the legislature. Under the provisions of Code  36-801 corporate utilities supplying electric power to the public, such as Georgia Power Company, have been granted the power of eminent domain.</div><div class="casepar">The Special Master Act (Code Ann. Chapter 36-6A (Ga. L. 1957, pp. 387, 388; 1962, pp. 461, 462; 1967, p. 825)) and more particularly Code Ann.  36-601a (Ga. L. 1957, pp. 387, 388; 1967, p. 825) provides "[a]s used in this Chapter, 'condemning body' shall mean the State of Georgia, or any branch of the Government of the State of Georgia or any county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the State of Georgia or any housing Authority now or hereafter established which is vested with the power of eminent domain, and all other persons, firms and corporations possessing the right or power of eminent domain, or which shall hereafter be given said right or power of eminent domain." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">As held by the Supreme Court in Sadtler v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/85/index.html">236 Ga. 396</a></span>, 398 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../109/85/index.html">223 SE2d 819</a></span>), "the Special Master Act [Code Ann. Ch. 36-6A, supra.] enacted in 1957 provides that a condemning body may petition the superior court of the county having jurisdiction 'for a judgment in rem against said property, or any easement or other interest in said property, condemning the same in fee simple to the use of the petitioner upon payment of just and adequate compensation therefor.' Code Ann.  36-603a." (Emphasis supplied.)</div><div class="casepar">3. A party having the right to condemn is vested with a large discretion in the selection of the particular property to be condemned. Therefore, in the absence of bad faith, the determination by the condemnor, in the case sub judice, of reasonable necessity for acquiring the condemnee's land cannot be disturbed by this court. Piedmont Cotton Mills v. Ga. R. &amp; Electric Co., <span class="casemissing">131 Ga. 129 (2)</span>, 134 (<span class="casemissing">62 SE 52</span>). See also King v. City of McCaysville, <span class="casemissing">198 Ga. 829 (2) (33 SE2d 99)</span>; Kellett v. Fulton County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/94/index.html">215 Ga. 551</a></span>, 555 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../171/94/index.html">111 SE2d 364</a></span>); Zuber Lumber Co. v. City of Atlanta, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../106/63/index.html">237 Ga. 358</a></span>, 360 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../106/63/index.html">227 SE2d 362</a></span>); City of Atlanta v. Heirs of Champion, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../869/9/index.html">244 Ga. 620</a></span>, supra; Pye v. State Hwy. Dept., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../140/69/index.html">226 Ga. 389 (6)</a></span>, 406 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../140/69/index.html">175 SE2d 510</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">Condemnee has presented evidence as to recreational facilities planned by the condemnor for the security buffer zone. The application by condemnor to the Federal Power Commission (and later to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) for a license to operate the facility contained detailed plans for the construction of boat ramps, campgrounds, baseball diamonds, hiking trails and other recreational facilities. Based on this evidence the condemnee contends that a large portion of her land is being taken for recreational uses unrelated to the purpose of generating electricity.</div><div class="casepar">Condemnor's evidence is that such recreational use is merely incidental to the preservation of the buffer zone for security purposes, that there was no present plan for the erection of the proposed facilities and that if they were constructed they would not interfere with the primary security purpose. Although issues of bad faith and capricious conduct may have been raised by condemnee's evidence, there was conflicting evidence so that the determination of the factual issue was for the superior court and will not be disturbed on appeal. Barrett v. State Hwy. Dept., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../184/90/index.html">211 Ga. 876</a></span>, 877 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../184/90/index.html">89 SE2d 652</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">5. "So long as the procedure used to take the condemnee's property is in accordance with the law, he has no ground of complaint because another procedure, also authorized by law, was not used." State Hwy. Dept. v. Respess, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/63/index.html">111 Ga. App. 421</a></span>, 423 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../654/63/index.html">142 SE2d 73</a></span>). There is no merit in condemnee's contention that the special master proceeding should have been dismissed for failure of Georgia Power Company to prove the necessity of a quick taking. See also Johnson v. Fulton County, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../676/56/index.html">103 Ga. App. 873</a></span>, 876 (1), supra.</div><div class="casepar">6. Relying upon the language of Code  36-811, condemnee contends that Georgia Power Company is required to make a showing that it had attempted to negotiate the purchase of condemnee's land as a prerequisite to its right to maintain the condemnation procedure. This contention overlooks the fact that the provisions of Code  36-811 contemplate only condemnation proceedings pursuant to Code Chapters 36-2 through 36-6. The special master procedure is an in rem proceeding which contains no requirement of negotiation. Compare St. Clair v. State Hwy. Bd., <span class="casemissing">45 Ga.
