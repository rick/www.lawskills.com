Dawson Superior Court. Before Judge Girardeau.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Tommy Lee Waldrip was convicted of the malice murder of Keith Lloyd Evans as well as two counts of felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated battery, five counts of aggravated assault, theft by taking a motor vehicle, arson in the second degree, influencing a witness, concealing a death, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and two counts of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> The jury recommended the death penalty, finding as aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of kidnapping with bodily injury or aggravated battery; and that the murder was outrageously wanton, vile, horrible and inhuman in that it involved aggravated battery to the victim. Waldrip appeals his convictions and death sentence. We affirm.</div><div class="casepar">The jury was authorized to find that appellant murdered Keith Evans to prevent Evans from testifying against his son, John Mark Waldrip, at his armed robbery retrial in Forsyth County. Evans, who worked as a clerk in the store at the time of the robbery, testified as the State's sole eyewitness at John Mark's first trial in 1990. Although John Mark was convicted in the 1990 trial, the trial court granted his motion for new trial, and he was released on bond pending the retrial. At the time of his death, Evans was scheduled to testify at the retrial.</div><div class="casepar">On Saturday afternoon, two days before the retrial was scheduled to begin, the appellant and his co-indictees, John Mark and appellant's brother-in-law, Howard Livingston, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> drove to Cleveland, Georgia and bought a used station wagon for $150, which they returned a half hour later because it was overheating. That evening, John Mark called Robert Garner, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source3" href="#note3">3</a></span> who was also scheduled to testify against him at the retrial, and threatened to harm Garner if he testified. At approximately 9:30 p.m. appellant and John Mark left appellant's apartment in appellant's wife's Ford Tempo. Sometime between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, the co-indictees met Evans at a highway crossing in Dawson County. After running Evans' truck off the road, they shot at him through the windshield. He was hit with birdshot from a shotgun in the face and neck. Since Evans was still alive, the co-indictees drove his truck, with Evans in the passenger seat, to Hugh Stowers Road in Dawson County, where they beat him to death</div><div class="casepar">to count 12; count 14, concealing a death, to twelve months to run concurrent with count 3; count 16, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, to five years to run concurrent with count 3; count 19, possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, to five years, to run consecutive to count 13; count 20, possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, to five years to run concurrent with count 19. The felony murder convictions stand vacated by operation of law under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/1/7/index.html">16-1-7</a></span>. Appellant filed a motion for new trial on November 16, 1994, and an amended motion for new trial on September 1, 1995, which was denied on November 28, 1995. Appellant filed a notice of appeal on December 4, 1995. The case was docketed in this Court on July 30, 1996 and was orally argued on October 22, 1996.</div><div class="casepar">with a blackjack. They buried Evans' body in a shallow grave in Gilmer County and set his truck on fire.</div><div class="casepar">The fire was reported at approximately 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning. A current insurance card for the Ford Tempo, belonging to appellant's wife, Linda Waldrip, was found near the burned truck. Appellant was interviewed on Sunday afternoon and denied any involvement in Evans' disappearance. During the interview, Linda Waldrip was asked for her insurance card for the Ford Tempo, and she produced an expired card.</div><div class="casepar">John Mark's retrial for armed robbery did not take place. On Monday morning, Keith Evans was missing and Garner refused to testify against John Mark. Garner subsequently informed the district attorney of the threats made against him, and John Mark was arrested and charged with influencing a witness.</div><div class="casepar">Appellant was arrested on Tuesday, and on Thursday, confessed to shooting and beating the victim and burning his truck. He then led authorities to the victim's body, and later, to the shotgun used in the crimes. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source4" href="#note4">4</a></span> The following day, appellant gave a conflicting statement, in which he contended that John Mark and Livingston murdered the victim and burned his truck, and that he was merely a bystander. Appellant gave a third statement in which he related that all three of the co-indictees participated in the crimes.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find appellant guilty of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).</div><div class="casepar">Competency Trial</div><div class="casepar">Appellant raises seven claims of error relating to his competency trial.</div><div class="casepar">1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's second motion for change of venue in the competency trial, based on appellant's contention that the change of venue from Dawson County to Hall County was insufficient to avoid excessive pretrial publicity. Appellant has not attempted to show there is a substantial likelihood the competency trial was rendered unfair due to pretrial publicity, nor has he established prejudice by individual jurors. Jones v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../379/4/index.html">261 Ga. 665 (409 SE2d 642) (1991)</a></span>. As support for this ground, appellant states only that two jurors on the trial jury had read newspaper articles about the trial, and cites to five on the jury panel who were familiar with the case without any further explanation. Our review of the record reveals that neither of the jurors on the trial jury had any clear recollection of what they had read, and both jurors stated they did not have any fixed opinion regarding appellant's competency, and appellant has failed to show a high excusal rate in general as a result of publicity. See, e.g., Chancey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../544/7/index.html">256 Ga. 415</a></span>, 429 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../544/7/index.html">349 SE2d 717</a></span>) (1986). The fact that the parties originally stipulated to venue in a county other than Hall <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source5" href="#note5">5</a></span>does not relieve appellant from showing he was prejudiced by the trial court's denial of his motion. This claim is without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. The trial Court did not abuse its broad discretion in limiting the scope of the voir dire at the competency trial by prohibiting questions of a technical or legal nature, or questions which required the jurors to prejudge the case. McGinnis v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../488/5/index.html">258 Ga. 673</a></span>, 674-675 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../488/5/index.html">372 SE2d 804</a></span>) (1988).</div><div class="casepar">3. Appellant's contention that the State improperly placed his character in issue during the competency trial by referring to his prior criminal history is without merit. "[T]he issue at a competency trial is whether the defendant at the time of the trial is capable of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings against him and his own condition in reference to such proceedings, and is capable of rendering assistance to his attorney in the defense of his case." Black v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../383/9/index.html">261 Ga. 791</a></span>, 794 (2) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../383/9/index.html">410 SE2d 740</a></span>) (1991). Since a competency trial isin the nature of a civil proceeding, evidence that may place appellant's character in issue is admissible, if it is relevant to the issues to be decided. Id.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence of prior crimes committed by appellant was offered to counter expert testimony that appellant harbored the delusional belief he was being monitored by law enforcement officers, and also to show appellant's familiarity with the criminal justice system. There was no reference to the facts of these prior offenses, and no testimony by the victims or witnesses of these crimes. We have found such evidence to be admissible to show whether a defendant understood the charges against him. Brown v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../543/3/index.html">256 Ga. 387</a></span>, 389 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../543/3/index.html">349 SE2d 452</a></span>) (1986). <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source6" href="#note6">6</a></span>Compare Crawford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/1/index.html">240 Ga. 321</a></span>, 326 (2) (<span class="casemissing">240 SE2d 824</span>) (1977). Given the limitations imposed by the trial court and the purpose for which the convictions were offered, we find no error.</div><div class="casepar">4. Appellant's contention that the prosecutor misled the jury at the competency trial by asking appellant's former attorney why she delayed notifying the trial court that appellant required psychiatric treatment has not been preserved for appellate review because appellant failed to renew his motion for mistrial after the trial court issued a curative instruction. Woodham v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/5/index.html">263 Ga. 580 (1)</a></span> (b), (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../307/5/index.html">439 SE2d 471</a></span>) (1993).</div><div class="casepar">5. Appellant's contention that the trial court should have sua sponte rebuked the prosecutor and issued a curative instruction under OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/8/75/index.html">17-8-75</a></span>, when the psychologist who conducted the court-ordered examination referred to himself as the "judge's witness" during the competency trial, is without merit. Even assuming appellant's failure to object did not constitute waiver of this issue, the witness explained that under this Court's opinion in Tolbert v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../410/7/index.html">260 Ga. 527</a></span>, 528 (1) (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../410/7/index.html">397 SE2d 439</a></span>)(1990), he was required to be independent and impartial.</div><div class="casepar">6. Appellant contends that the trial court erred by repeatedly allowing the State to refer to the pending charges against him at the competency trial. See Division 3, supra. Whether appellant understood the nature and gravity of the charges against him was highly relevant to the competency proceeding. Black v. State, 261 Ga. at 794. The prosecutor's questions were focused on appellant's understanding of the charges, not his guilt or innocence, or the facts of these or any prior crimes, and the jury was properly charged on its duty on the special plea of incompetency. See Brown v. State, 256 Ga. at 388-389; Chambers v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../695/6/index.html">250 Ga. 856</a></span>, 858-859 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../695/6/index.html">302 SE2d 86</a></span>) (1983). We find no error.</div><div class="casepar">7. Appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly commented on his exercise of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights during the competency trial is procedurally defaulted, based on his failure to object to these comments. Earnest v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../338/8/index.html">262 Ga. 494 (422 SE2d 188) (1992)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">Voir Dire</div><div class="casepar">8. Appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to excuse prospective jurors Larue Davis, Perry Gant, and Margaret Lynch because of bias.</div><div class="casepar">(a) Appellant argues that Davis should have been excused under Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 424-426 (105 SC 844, 83 LE2d 841) (1985), because she stated repeatedly that she considered the death penalty to be appropriate punishment for a defendant convicted of murder and could not think of any mitigating circumstances which would change her mind. In fact, the prosecutor objected to appellant's question asking Davis whether she could think of mitigating circumstances, and the objection, which was valid, was sustained by the trial court. A prospective juror's inability to recite circumstances which might lead her to vote for a life sentence is not dispositive of her qualifications to serve as a juror. See Crowe v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../244/6/index.html">265 Ga. 582</a></span>, 588 (9) (a) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../244/6/index.html">458 SE2d 799</a></span>) (1995). Although Davis initially stated that she would vote for death under certain circumstances, she stated that she would put her own feelings aside and follow the court's instructions. Davis stated that she felt "confident" she would not arbitrarily vote to impose the death penalty and would consider the evidence presented in accordance with the trial court's instructions. She consistently responded that she would weigh evidence in mitigation and consider seriously the option of a life sentence. See Hittson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../279/6/index.html">264 Ga. 682</a></span>, 687-688 (6) (h) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../279/6/index.html">449 SE2d 586</a></span>) (1994).</div><div class="casepar">It is the "final distillation" of the prospective juror's thoughts, and not isolated responses, which determine whether the juror meets the Witt standard. Taylor v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../364/3/index.html">261 Ga. 287</a></span>, 291-292 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../364/3/index.html">404 SE2d 255</a></span>) (1991); Spivey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../611/1/index.html">253 Ga. 187</a></span>, 197, n. 3 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../611/1/index.html">319 SE2d 420</a></span>) (1984). Davis' voir dire responses, reviewed in their entirety, support the trial court's finding that Davis was qualified to serve as a juror and failure to excuse her was not an abuse of discretion. Ledford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/7/index.html">264 Ga. 60</a></span>, 64 (6) (b) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../257/7/index.html">439 SE2d 917</a></span>) (1994).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Appellant contends that Davis' misunderstanding of his parole eligibility <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source7" href="#note7">7</a></span> impaired her ability to serve as a juror, thus mandating her disqualification. See, e.g., Burgess v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/9/index.html">264 Ga. 777</a></span>, 780 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../281/9/index.html">450 SE2d 680</a></span>) (1994). Davis' responses to repeated questioning on this issue by both the trial court and appellant, indicated that the possibility of parole was not an overriding concern which would lead her to automatically vote for death upon conviction. In fact, Davis acknowledged that a defendant might be rehabilitated, and she consistently stated that she could set aside her views and follow the trial court's instructions. Ledford, supra.</div><div class="casepar">State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../507/6/index.html">257 Ga. 243</a></span>, 250 (8) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../507/6/index.html">357 SE2d 48</a></span>) (1987). The trial court's finding that Gant was qualified is consistent with the general rule that a juror who merely leans one way or another, before hearing any evidence, is not subject to disqualification. Jarrell v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/0/index.html">261 Ga. 880</a></span>, 881-882 (1) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../389/0/index.html">413 SE2d 710</a></span>) (1992). Although Gant initially stated that he would not makea very good juror, a juror's doubt as to his own impartiality does not demand as a matter of law that he be excused for cause. Greenway v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/09/index.html">207 Ga. App. 511</a></span>, 513 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../321/09/index.html">428 SE2d 415</a></span>) (1993). In finding Gant qualified to serve, the trial court relied in large part on Gant's demeanor, noting that Gant's assurances of his ability to follow the court's instructions and decide the case solely on the evidence were immediate and unequivocal. The trial court's finding in this regard should be accorded deference by this Court, and, after reviewing his voir dire as a whole, we find no abuse of discretion in qualifying Gant. Ledford v.

Appellant contends that the trial court improperly restricted voir dire because he was not permitted to ask prospective jurors about their understanding of the meaning of a life sentence. Voir dire on this issue is generally not permitted, since a prospective juror's views on this subject are extraneous to the ability to serve. Burgess v. State, 264 Ga. at 780. Even if appellant had been permitted to identify jurors like Davis, who were concerned about the possibility of parole, disqualification would not be automatic, since it would still have to be shown that the jurors' views would not permit them to consider evidence in mitigation or the option of a life sentence.

Id. However, John Mark's statements were made during the pendency of the conspiracy, not during the concealment phase. Compare Copeland v. State, 266 Ga. at 665. Therefore, his statements are admissible both under Georgia law and under the common-law rule, and the statements are presumed to be sufficiently reliable to satisfy the Confrontation Clause's requirement of trustworthiness. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 183 (107 SC 2775, 97 LE2d 144) (1987). There is no need to make an independent inquiry into the reliability of a statement "when the evidence 'falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.' " Id., quoting Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.

Under the circumstances of this case, the hearsay at issue did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</div><div class="casepar">(d) Appellant's contention that testimony by a law enforcement officer, regarding a jailhouse conversation he overheard between appellant and John Mark, was inadmissible as the statement of a co-conspirator, because the conspiracy was terminated after appellant led police to the victim's body, has not been preserved for review. Appellant expressly waived objection to this testimony at trial. See, e.g., Waldrip v. State, 266 Ga. at 879-880. Moreover, a conspiracy does not necessarily end simply because one of the conspirators has been arrested and confesses, if the conspiracy to conceal the identity of one of the perpetrators is ongoing.

Appellant argues that the State improperly placed his character in issue by eliciting testimony from Officer Steve Hawkes that appellant was arrested two days after the victim's disappearance for violating his probation on a prior unrelated offense.

Hawkes' testimony was relevant for two reasons: to show that appellant made an admission during the ride to the jail, by asking Hawkes whether his arrest was related toJohn Mark's arrest in Dawson County, and also, to explain the reason for appellant's arrest, in as much as appellant was never released prior to being charged with the crimes against the victim. Testimony explaining the reason for appellant's arrest need not be excluded simply because it incidentally shows the commission of another crime. Id. The arresting officer did not mention the nature of the previous offense, and even if he had, the jury was already aware of appellant's prior burglary conviction, which served as the basis for the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Appellant contends that venue in Dawson County was improper for the crime of concealing the death of another, since the victim was buried in Gilmer County. According to appellant's statement, the victim died in Dawson County as a result of the beating inflicted by the co-indictees and was then transported in his truck to Gilmer County for burial. The place of burial is not dispositive of venue, since the crime of concealing Evans' body could also have occurred in the vehicle traveling from Dawson County to Gilmer County. See, e.g., Addison v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../246/1/index.html">265 Ga. 657 (461 SE2d 227)</a></span>(1995).

In accordance with his unopposed motion for change of venue, appellant was tried before a jury in Gwinnett County, and sentenced to death for malice murder on October 26, 1994. The trial court also sentenced appellant on count 3, kidnapping with bodily injury, to life imprisonment; count 5, aggravated assault, to twenty years to run concurrent with count 3; count 10, theft by taking a motor vehicle, to twenty years to run concurrent with count 3; count 12, arson in the second degree, to ten years to run consecutive to count 3; count 13, influencing a witness, to five years to run consecutive </div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Following appellant's convictions, John Mark and Livingston were convicted in separate trials. John Mark's conviction and life sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. See Waldrip v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../222/4/index.html">266 Ga. 874</a></span>, 880 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../222/4/index.html">471 SE2d 857</a></span>) (1996). Livingston also received a life sentence. His appeal is pending in this Court.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note3" href="#source3">3</a></span>&nbsp;
      Garner, who drove the car during the armed robbery, did not testify at John Mark's 1990 armed robbery trial. Shortly before the retrial was scheduled to begin, Garner gave a statement to police implicating himself and John Mark in the armed robbery and agreed to testify against John Mark.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note4" href="#source4">4</a></span>&nbsp;
      According to this statement, appellant was responsible for all of the crimes against the victim, John Mark was let out of the car and left prior to the shooting, and Livingston, although present, was merely a bystander.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note5" href="#source5">5</a></span>&nbsp;
      The original motion was made in 1991. Appellant's competency trial was held in 1995.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note6" href="#source6">6</a></span>&nbsp;
      Appellant relies on Brown v. State for his contention that evidence of prior crimes committed by the defendant is per se inadmissible during a competency trial. In Brown, the trial court permitted the victims of prior crimes to testify in order to show that the defendant understood the charges against him. 256 Ga. at 388-389. In affirming the trial court's ruling, we distinguished the case from Crawford v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../973/1/index.html">240 Ga. 321 (240 SE2d 824) (1977)</a></span>, noting that in Brown, evidence of the prior crimes was relevant to the issues at the competency trial, and there was no evidence presented regarding the crimes for which the defendant was presently charged. Id.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note7" href="#source7">7</a></span>&nbsp;
      In response to the trial court's question asking whether she could impose the death penalty, Davis stated that if a defendant was "guilty without a shadow of a doubt" and bad no remorse, she could vote for death, because she did not think that the victim's family should have to worry about him being released on parole after serving part of his life sentence.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note8" href="#source8">8</a></span>&nbsp;
      Garner, who was incarcerated elsewhere, had been brought to the Forsyth County jail to await testifying at John Mark's retrial.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note9" href="#source9">9</a></span>&nbsp;
      OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/24/3/5/index.html">24-3-5</a></span> provides: "After the fact of conspiracy is proved, the declarations by one of the conspirators during the pendency of the criminal project shall be admissible against all."Ga. 739) JANUARY TERM, 1997. 747Garner, since it was John Mark who was charged with the crime of attempting to influence Garner. It is unnecessary to prove an express agreement between the parties in order to find the existence of a conspiracy. Duffy v. State, 262 Ga. at 250; Drane v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../232/8/index.html">265 Ga. 255</a></span>, 257-258 (4) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../232/8/index.html">455 SE2d 27</a></span>) (1995). The essence of conspiracy is a common design, and conduct which discloses a common design may give rise to an inference of conspiracy. Drane at 257-258. Evidence of a violation of a different statute does not create separate conspiracies, since the character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing separate parts but by looking at it as a whole. Thus, even if one conspirator acts separately from the others to achieve a common goal, his acts will be imputed to the others, without a new agreement directed to that particular act. See, e.g., Bruce v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../296/9/index.html">263 Ga. 273</a></span>, 274-275 (5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../296/9/index.html">430 SE2d 745</a></span>) (1993).The jury could have inferred, from the evidence adduced at trial, that the common design of the co-indictees was to prevent John Mark from being convicted for armed robbery by eliminating material witnesses who would testify against him. Since this would not be accomplished by eliminating only Evans, the conspiracy encompassed John Mark's threats against Garner.</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note10" href="#source10">10</a></span>&nbsp;

      The State initially sought the death penalty against both John Mark Waldrip and Howard Livingston.
