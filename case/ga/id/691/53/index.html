Before Judge Stephens. Laurens Superior Court. May 16, 1957.</div><div class="casepresiding">GARDNER, P.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">Guy Scarborough filed suit for property damages and personal injury against Edgar Talley and Willene Jane Talley. The defendants filed separate answers and cross-actions. A verdict for the defendants was returned, and their counter-claim was dismissed. The plaintiff filed a motion for new trial on the general grounds and later amended by adding 5 special grounds. The motion for new trial was denied and it is on this judgment that the case is here for review.</div><div class="casepar">The evidence shows substantially as follows: Dudley C. Harvey, Jr., witness for the plaintiff, testified that he made estimates on repair of plaintiff's 1950 Chevrolet truck in the amount of $533.20.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff, Guy Scarborough, testified that on April 3, 1954, he was driving his 1950 Chevrolet truck south on Mimosa Street in the City of Dublin, Georgia, and as he started to cross the intersection of Mimosa Street and Highland Avenue, he saw a car approaching the intersection on Highland Avenue on his right; that the car was 75 to 100 feet from the intersection; that he figured he had time to get across the intersection; that, the driver of the car picked up speed; that he, the plaintiff, stepped on the gas trying to get out of the way and that the defendant's car struck his truck as the car came into the intersection, the plaintiff's truck having passed the center of the street; that the defendants' car hit the plaintiff's truck at the door and back end, turning his truck against a big tree and completely wrecking it; that he received injuries to his shoulder, head and leg for which he claims damages in the amount of $400, in addition to damages for the truck and the hospital and doctor bills; that he sold the wrecked truck for $160 although it was worth between nine hundred and a thousand dollars before the collision.</div><div class="casepar">On cross-examination the plaintiff testified that he believed the defendants' car was 300 feet from the intersection when he first saw it; that he, the plaintiff, was driving about 15 miles per hour.</div><div class="casepar">Dr. J. F. O'Daniel testified that he treated the plaintiff for his injuries to his shoulder and head after the accident and recalled that he did not appear seriously injured or in any shock, and that he saw the plaintiff several times later at his office and gave him symptomatic treatment.</div><div class="casepar">Murray A. Chappell testified that he heard the noise of the collision and went directly to the scene and helped Mr. Scarborough out of the truck; that the plaintiff seemed excited and his glasses were broken and he had a bump on his head.</div><div class="casepar">Guy Scarborough, called as the opposite party for the purpose of cross-examination, testified substantially that he had been driving for 45 years and was well aware of the rule about the party on the right having the right of way; that he saw the defendants' car in plenty of time to stop but he was nearer the intersection and had time to get across and was actually across the intersection when the car hit his truck. The plaintiff further testified that he did not know the details of the counter-suits for damages which had been filed against him and settled on behalf of two of the defendants, but he had no objections to their being settled.</div><div class="casepar">Tillman Jones, chief of police, testified that he investigated the accident; that there were no stop signs at the said intersection at the time and that there was no violation on the part of either of the parties involved so far as the city ordinance was concerned; that it appeared they both entered the intersection and collided, the defendants' car striking the plaintiff's truck.</div><div class="casepar">The driver of the defendants' car, Willene Talley, testified that the plaintiff's truck appeared to slow down at the intersection and she assumed he would stop, since she had the right of way, so she proceeded to cross the intersection, at which time the plaintiff speeded across in front of her; that she applied her brakes but was unable to stop whereupon she struck the back side of the truck from the door where the body hooked on the truck. She further testified that the plaintiff told her it was not her fault, that he was trying to beat her across.</div><div class="casepar">Three other passengers of the defendants' car, including the driver's mother and two male friends, testified substantially the same as the driver. The mother, in her testimony, stated that the plaintiff said to her after the accident, "Mrs. Talley, I sure tried to beat you all across there but I didn't make it."</div><div class="casepar">Edgar Talley, owner of the defendants' car but not a passenger at the time of the accident, testified that although his daughter, Edwina, was one of the passengers and a witness to the accident, she did not appear to testify because he did not think they would need her testimony and he did not wish to cause her to miss two or three days from school; that the two cross-actions on behalf of Mrs. Talley and Willene Talley had been settled satisfactorily. On cross-examination he testified that neither the plaintiff nor the plaintiff's attorney in the case at bar was present when the cross-actions of his daughter and his wife were settled.</div><div class="casepar"> J. 1. The evidence is amply sufficient to support the verdict.</div><div class="casepar">2. Special ground 1 contends that the court did not completely and fully instruct the jury on the law of the case. Special ground 3 is very similar. Both of these grounds are intermingled with the general grounds and show no cause for reversal.</div><div class="casepar">3. Special ground 2 contends that a new trial should be granted because the court in instructing the jury unduly stressed the fact that the plaintiff could not recover if the plaintiff did not exercise ordinary care to avoid injury to himself and property. Special ground 4 contends that a new trial should be granted because the court did not give sufficient instructions to the jury as to what facts would constitute negligence on the part of the defendants. When we consider the charge of the court as a whole on these points, which are closely interrelated, we find that special grounds 2 and 4 are not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">4. Special ground 5 contends that a new trial should be granted because Edgar Talley, one of the defendants, had testified that he employed Carl K. Nelson, who was representing him in this case and was then examining Talley as a witness, to bring suit for him against Mr. Scarborough for his wife, Mrs. Talley and minor daughter, Willene. This witness then testified: "And when this suit was filed, he filed a cross-action for Mrs. Talley and Willene. These claims have been settled. He signed releases to the attorney for Mr. Scarborough's insurance company. The cross-actions have been settled satisfactory. I do not recall the exact date that they were paid off. I could go back and get my deposits and clarify that if it's necessary." The plaintiff contends that "neither the plaintiff nor anyone representing him had anything to do with the settlement and paying off of the counter-claim or even had any knowledge of the settlement. The pleadings showed that the counter-claim was dismissed. The plaintiff moved to rule out all of this testimony. The court made this ruling: 'I think it would be admissible on this idea. They file a cross-action against Mr. Scarborough and they abandoned that and consequently the jury won't have to consider it at all. I think it would be admissible to show why they abandoned that cross-action.' Movant contends that this ruling was error and the admission of this testimony was harmful and that the court in effect held that this testimony was admissible over any objection. Movant contends that it was improper and harmful to the plaintiff for the defendant to show why the defendants abandoned the cross-action and the record showed the fact that the cross-action was abandoned. Further, it was harmful and improper to prove to the jury that the insurance company insuring the liability of Scarborough had paid the claim against him; that this was an admission of liability on their part and amounted to evidence from a third person as to negligence on the part of Scarborough. It was not an issue as to why the defendants abandoned the cross-action. It was sufficient that they did, yet the court was holding that the evidence was admissible to show why the cross-action was abandoned. This testimony swayed the jury against Scarborough and away from the true issues in the case when it was shown that the insurance company paid off and the cross-action was settled 'satisfactory' to Talley."</div><div class="casepar">The court approved special ground 5 with provisions, using the following language: "The recital of facts contained in the foregoing amendment for a new trial is approved as true and correct contentions and all of the grounds of the amendment are approved as contentions of movant, under the following provisions: None of the testimony or contentions complained of in ground 5 were objected to on direct examination as disclosed by the record. After direct examination Mr. Crockett asked the witness, Mr. Talley, the following questions and then made his objection: Q. Mr. Talley, did Mr. Scarborough have an attorney when that was settled? A. I have no knowledge of who had anything to do with it except that I met with this attorney, who I think was the third attorney that they had had for this case; he came down from Macon the second time. Q. Was Mr. Scarborough or I there? A. No, you were not present, and neither was Mr. Scarborough. By Mr. Crockett: 'I move to rule it all out.' At this stage the court made the ruling complained of in ground 5 of the amended motion." We have considered the exclusion provisions of the court and the motion as it originally stood. Under the pleadings and the facts this special ground is not meritorious.</div><div class="casepar">The court did not err in denying the motion for new trial for any reason assigned.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed.
