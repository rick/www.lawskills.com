Where, as here, an execution is levied on real estate as property of a defendant in fi. fa. and the same is purchased at a judicial sale and the proceeds thereof disbursed by the sheriff, who, after paying the execution in his hands and costs of the sale, turns over the surplus remaining in his hands to the defendant, and where thereafter the sale is by a decree in equity canceled and set aside for the reason that the defendant in fi. fa. had no title or leviable interest because of the existence of an outstanding loan deed, such defendant has no legal or equitable right to the surplus proceeds of the void sale. The levy and sale being void, the doctrine of caveat emptor is inapplicable. Corley v. Jarrell, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 225</span> (136 S. E. 177). Accordingly, the purchaser at such void sale is entitled, in an action as for money had and received, to recover the part of the proceeds in the hands of the defendant in fi. fa.</div><div class="casepar">2. Such an action should proceed in the name of the sheriff who erroneously disbursed said fund, suing for the use of the person entitled thereto.</div><div class="casepar">3. A petition may properly allege a conclusion of law where the facts validating such conclusion clearly appear.</div><div class="casepar">The petition alleges that Joe Adams as Sheriff of Floyd County and J. L. Todd, as purchaser at a sheriff's sale conducted by Adams levied on certain real estate as property of the defendant under and by virtue of a certain fi. fa.; that Todd paid Adams $2,025 for said property; that Adams paid out $1,210 of this sum to the plaintiff in fi. fa. and remitted the excess of $738.75 to Milam; that thereafter the Supreme Court (Todd v. Morgan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../170/98/index.html">215 Ga. 220</a></span>, 109 S. E. 2d 803) ruled the aforementioned levy null and void because title to the realty was not in the defendant and because of said ruling the deed is a nullity; that Todd has recovered the $1,210 disbursed by the sheriff to the plaintiff in fi. fa., but Milam refuses to repay to either plaintiff the money so disbursed to him.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff in error by bill of exceptions assigns error on the overruling of certain general and special demurrers to the petition. The defendant in error by cross-bill assigns error on the sustaining of one of the special demurrers.</div><div class="casepar">1. Properly construed, this petition sets out an action for money had and received, which lies in every instance where another has come into possession of money to which the plaintiff is entitled in equity and good conscience, and which the defendant is not otherwise entitled to retain. Zapf Realty Co. v. Brown, <span class="casemissing">26 Ga. App. 443</span> (106 S. E. 748); A. D. Adair &amp; McCarty Bros. v. Central Bank &amp; Trust Corp., <span class="casemissing">20 Ga. App. 811</span> (93 S. E. 542). Even though paid out under a mistake of fact it is recoverable if the recipient by retaining it would be unjustly enriched. Atlanta Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Fain, <span class="casemissing">16 Ga. App. 475</span> (85 S. E. 791); Stern v. Howell, <span class="casemissing">33 Ga. App. 693</span> (127 S. E. 775). And even if paid out because of a negligent mistake, this will not prevent recovery if the plaintiff's negligence violates no positive legal duty which he owes the defendant. Dobbs v. Perlman, <span class="casemissing">59 Ga. App. 770</span> (2 S. E. 2d 109).</div><div class="casepar">The property in question was illegally sold as the property of the defendant Milam for the reason that there was an outstanding security deed in favor of one Morgan and hence there was no leviable interest in the land in Milam. Morgan v. Todd, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../174/54/index.html">214 Ga. 497</a></span> (106 S. E. 2d 37). However, in doing so both the plaintiff in fi. fa. and the purchaser were proceeding under a mistake of law, in that they relied on certain acts of the legislature (Code, Ann.,  67-1308) as having caused title to revert to the defendant. In Todd v. Morgan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../170/98/index.html">215 Ga. 220</a></span>, supra, the acts comprising this Code section were held unconstitutional in so far as they applied to the property in question. The effect of the decision was to affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the true owner who sought cancellation of the sheriff's deed in favor of the plaintiff Todd, constituting an adjudication that the sale was void and that Todd received nothing thereunder. It is also an adjudication that the defendant Milam had no legal title to the property and no interest therein which could have been affected by the void sale.</div><div class="casepar">The distribution of the funds arising from the sale in the hands of the sheriff proceeds on equitable principles, taking account of the priorities of the various creditors. Code  39-201; 24-211. Where the parties to a judicial sale conduct the same, and a bid is made, under a mistake of law, the purchaser is not bound absolutely thereby, but may plead the mistake of law as a defense against an action to enforce his first bid. See Collier v. Perkerson, <span class="casemissing">31 Ga. 117</span>, citing as authority Culbreath v. Culbreath, <span class="casemissing">7 Ga. 64</span>, which latter case was an action for money had and received. The defendant in fi. fa. is not entitled to the surplus resulting from a levy and sale simply by virtue of that position, but the surplus is to be paid over to the true owner thereof under equitable principles. Fulcher v. Felker, <span class="casemissing">28 Ga. 252</span>.</div><div class="casepar">This case closely resembles Holbrook v. Stewart, <span class="casemissing">55 Ga. App. 720</span> (191 S. E. 165) where it was held: "Before an execution can be levied legally on land given as security the lender must reconvey the land to the borrower, and have the deed of reconveyance recorded. A sale made under a levy without such deed of reconveyance is void, and will be set aside at the instance of the borrower. The effect of cancellation of the deed to the purchaser at the sheriff's sale, by a court of equity on this ground, is to nullify the proceedings had under the judgment from the time of the illegal levy."</div><div class="casepar">The doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply where the sale is void and the purchaser, by reason of the invalidity of the sale, on the ground of a void levy, or otherwise, acquires no title. 23 C. J. 655,  623; 30A Am. Jur. 1009, Judicial Sales,  181. The case of Methvin v. Bexley, <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. 551</span>, stands for the doctrine that where an execution sale is valid, the purchaser obtains whatever the defendant in fi. fa. had, and under the doctrine of caveat emptor is bound to the contract and cannot recover the purchase money which he paid to the sheriff. The only thing complained of in that case was that the defendant in fi. fa. had no title to the property sold under the fi. fas. There was no contention that the levy or sale was otherwise invalid. The dissent by Judge Stephens, in Brady v. Smotherman, <span class="casemissing">51 Ga. App. 480</span>, 489, supra, states the true law as to the facts in this case. That case decided that where a levy was excessive the purchaser could not recover from the officer making the sale after the officer had paid the purchase money over to the plaintiff in execution. The ruling by the majority in that case is not controlling in this case because this is not a case of an excessive levy. If the doctrine of caveat emptor applies to the sale in this case the Supreme Court could not have ruled as it did in McCord v. McGinty, <span class="casemissing">99 Ga. 307</span> (25 S. E. 667). There the court ruled that the sale was void because a deed was not filed and recorded conveying the land to the vendee and that the one who bid off the land could not be compelled to pay the amount of his bid and to accept the sheriff's deed to the property. The court in that case cited four older cases to the same effect. If the rule of caveat emptor applied in such a case, then the purchaser should have been held to be bound by this bid. See Corley v. Jarrell, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 225</span> (136 S. E. 177). Without further quoting from Judge Stephens' dissent in the Brady case it should read in toto in connection with the decision of this case. See also, Powell on Actions for Land, Revised Edition by Powers &amp; Mitchell, Chapter 10.</div><div class="casepar">It follows that here, the defendant having no legal, moral, or equitable right to the surplus fund in question, after the judicial sale in question has been set aside and the deed canceled, the doctrine of caveat emptor will not preclude an action to recover it of him as for money had and received, brought by or on behalf of one better entitled to it than himself. The first three grounds of demurrer are without merit.</div><div class="casepar">2. Since the right of action to recover the fund is nominally in the sheriff who disbursed it, while the right to the fund is in Todd, the petition should properly have been brought in the name of Adams suing for the use of Todd. Ground 4 of the demurrer based on a misjoinder of parties plaintiff should have been sustained.</div><div class="casepar">4. By cross-bill of exceptions error is assigned on the sustaining of a special demurrer to a paragraph alleging that the plaintiff has recovered from the plaintiff in fi. fa. the sum of $1,210 disbursed to her by the sheriff. Since this statement is irrelevant to the cause of action sued upon, it was not error for the court to sustain the special demurrer to this paragraph of the petition.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court did not err in overruling the general demurrer and certain special demurrers to the petition, but erred in overruling special demurrer numbered 4 as pointed out in division 2 hereof.</div><div class="casepar">CARLISLE, Judge, dissenting.</div><div class="casepar">480 (180 S. E. 862). I do not think that cases exemplified by Corley v. Jarrell, <span class="casemissing">36 Ga. App. 225</span> (136 S. E. 117), holding that, where the holder of a deed to secure debt fails to reconvey to the defendant in foreclosure prior to foreclosing the same, the sale under the foreclosure is void and the buyer is not compellable to pay the amount of his bid thereon, relied upon by the defendant in error, are pertinent to the question here. Such cases are distinguishable from the instant case in that in those cases the act of foreclosure and the acceptance of the benefits thereunder are the voluntary acts of the party foreclosing on the property, and he cannot take advantage of his own failure to do the thing which the law requires of him as a condition precedent to foreclosing on and selling the property.</div><div class="casepar">There is nothing in the decision of Todd v. Morgan, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../170/98/index.html">215 Ga. 220</a></span> (109 S. E. 2d 803) which authorizes the conclusion alleged in the petition that the Supreme Court held that the levy was null and void. This allegation, therefore, being unsupported by any facts alleged is not sufficient even as against a mere general demurrer to bring into operation the principle that the rule of caveat emptor does not apply to void sales. Henderson v. Swift Fertilizer Works, <span class="casemissing">16 Ga. App. 448</span> (1a) (85 S. E. 613); Daniel v. Burson, <span class="casemissing">18 Ga. App. 25 (2)</span> (88 S. E. 745); Gibbs v. Bank of Tifton, <span class="casemissing">21 Ga. App. 653</span> (1a) (94 S. E. 827). The petition does not allege any other facts warranting the conclusion that the sale in this case was void.</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Wright, Rogers, Magruder &amp; Hoyt, Clinton J.
