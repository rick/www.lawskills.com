The allegations of the petition make out a case for an accounting and recovery of a money judgment at law.</div><div class="casepar">3. The petition sets out a request for an accounting which is not intricate or complex and comes within the scope of an accounting at law.</div><div class="casepar">This is an appeal from orders sustaining general demurrers to the petition.</div><div class="casepar">The plaintiff, LuRie Dorough, age 16, by next friend, Douglas Dorough, filed her petition in the superior court against the defendants, Mrs. Ethel Dorough Pettus and her husband, J. B. Pettus. The petition states that it is "in equity and accounting" and sets forth requests for accounting, injunctive relief, future payments of rental moneys, and other relief. The defendants each entered a general demurrer to the petition, and these general demurrers were sustained by the trial court. Exceptions were taken and the appeal was transmitted to the Supreme Court of Georgia on the ground that it had jurisdiction of the cause for the reason that the cause was in equity. The matter was considered by the Supreme Court in Dorough v. Pettus, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/24/index.html">215 Ga. 649</a></span> (112 S. E. 2d 592), and, with all Justices concurring, was transferred to the Court of Appeals for the reason that the case was not an equity case and therefore the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction.</div><div class="casepar">The petition, in substance, alleges the following facts: The plaintiff, LuRie Dorough, age 16, and her brother and sister were the minor children of Jonah T. Dorough, who divorced the mother of these children and later married Mrs. Pettus, one of the defendants in this action. Jonah T. Dorough died February 2, 1955, while married to Mrs. Pettus, the defendant, and while the plaintiff and her brother and sister were minor children. The defendant, Mrs. Pettus, as his surviving widow in her own behalf and in behalf of the plaintiff and her brother and sister, made application for a year's support under the Georgia law, and pursuant to this proceeding the appraisers and the court set apart, as necessary for the support and maintenance of the widow and children, a certain parcel of land upon which were two apartment houses. At the time of this award of year's support, the plaintiff LuRie Dorough was 13 years of age. The other minor children have since become of age and are no longer entitled to contributions from the year's support award, and so are not of further interest in this case. The plaintiff since the death of her father, has lived with her natural mother, who remarried after she was divorced from the plaintiff's father. The deceased Jonah T. Dorough's second wife, the defendant Mrs. Pettus, has also remarried and she and her husband are living on the property designated for the year's support.</div><div class="casepar">The petition further alleges that the plaintiff has received no portion from the year's support to which she is legally entitled, and the defendants fail and refuse to pay to her any amounts of the income from the property and are depriving her of support and maintenance to which she is entitled, and that at no time has defendant Mrs. Pettus furnished any support for the plaintiff as contemplated by the year's support award, although the defendants have been in full and complete possession of the property and have been living upon it and have rented out portions of it for designated rents. At the time of this petition the plaintiff is 16 years of age, is residing with her natural mother, and is entitled to the support from her father's estate as set out by the year's support award. It is alleged that the plaintiff is legally and justly entitled to an accounting and a judgment for the amounts which should be paid to her as a minor under the year's support award, and the plaintiff is in need of such support, and it is working a hardship upon her in not receiving this necessary support. The plaintiff is in high school and is alleged to be in desperate need of support and maintenance out of her father's estate as provided by the year's support granted to her.</div><div class="casepar">This is a petition by LuRie Dorough, age 16, to assert her rights under a year's support award made to her stepmother and the minor children of her deceased father, one of whom is the plaintiff. After the death of her natural father, the year's support was set apart and awarded to his widow, this plaintiff's stepmother, and his only minor children, and it is on the rights accruing to her under this award that this minor child asks relief. The petition, designated as one in equity and for an accounting, was demurred to and the general demurrers were sustained. To this order sustaining the demurrers exceptions were taken and the matter was brought as one involving a suit in equity to the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia. Dorough v. Pettus, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/24/index.html">215 Ga. 649</a></span> (112 S. E. 2d 592). The Supreme Court in considering the case held that it was not an equity matter within the meaning of Code  2-3704, and the case was then transferred to this court. Since the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia has held that this case is not an equity case within the meaning of Code  2-3704, the petition, when considered by this court, must be evaluated only from the standpoint of those allegations which are relevant to a legal cause of action, and it is incumbent upon this court in ruling on the general demurrers to determine only whether the petition states a cause of action at law.</div><div class="casepar">Stripping the petition of all purely equitable elements, we find that the year's support included in its award the defendant stepmother and the plaintiff herein. We further find the petition to show that the plaintiff has received no support from the property awarded for the year's support, and that she is in dire need of its benefits. The plaintiff has demanded her share but it has been refused her. Her stepmother, the defendant, is living with her latest husband on the premises allocated to be used for the year's support, and portions of it are rented and producing income. The plaintiff alleges that an accounting is requested and the recovery of a money judgment.</div><div class="casepar">This court and the Supreme Court of this State have from earliest times provided for an accounting in a legal action in cases where such a legal accounting would be sufficient. Fowler v. Davis, <span class="casemissing">120 Ga. 442</span>, 445 (47 S. E. 951). The allegations of the petition here clearly indicate that any accounting necessary would not be intricate or complex and would come clearly in the sphere of a paper legal accounting. The Supreme Court of the State of Georgia in this case stated in Dorough v. Pettus, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../172/24/index.html">215 Ga. 649</a></span>, supra: "It does not appear that an accounting at law will not be as complete and effective as one in equity." The Supreme Court further states in commenting upon this case, "The allegations of the petition, however, seek only to make out a case for an accounting and the recovery of a money judgment." It seems clear then that the relief requested by the plaintiff is one which is clearly within the purview of the legal remedies granted by the State of Georgia. If an accounting is required, an auditor may be appointed under Code  10-102 and an accounting had at law. See McDonough Construction Co. v. Ormewood Apts., <span class="casecite"><a href="../../180/98/index.html">212 Ga. 620</a></span> (94 S. E. 2d 733).</div><div class="casepar">Under the facts alleged the apportioning of the net income is not left to the uncontrolled will and discretion of the wife of the deceased as it is ordinarily when the widow and children reside together.</div><div class="casepar">It is clear that the petition states a cause of action at law against the defendant Mrs. Ethel Dorough Pettus, and therefore the order sustaining the general demurrer as to her is hereby reversed.</div><div class="casepar">J. B. Pettus, the husband of Mrs. Ethel Dorough Pettus, was made a party defendant to this action: He asserted his general demurrer alleging that the petition sets forth no cause of action either in law or in equity against him. The allegations of the petition little more than make this defendant, J. B. Pettus, a party to the action for the reason that he is the husband of the principal defendant. Inasmuch as he has no rights in the year's support award and no responsibility owed to the plaintiff, no cause of action is stated against this defendant and the order sustaining his general demurrer is affirmed. The order sustaining the general demurrer of the defendant Mrs. Ethel Dorough Pettus is reversed.</div><div class="casepar">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part. Felton, C.
