Peck regularly employed by Gainesville Machine Company to drive a truck, was driving one of the company trucks on a return trip from Arkansas where certain machinery had been delivered and the truck, without any obvious cause or reason, turned from the road and went up an embankment then down and stopped. A witness who was following saw it, and stopped at the truck, observing that Peck was "gasping for breath." An ambulance attendant testified that he was obviously dead when they arrived for taking Peck to a hospital, and at the hospital he was dead on arrival.</div><div class="casepar">A doctor who examined him testified that while he had some superficial injuries, he did not relate the employee's death to any accidental cause but to a heart attack, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span> and another physician testified that the most probable cause of his death was a myocardial infarction, <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source2" href="#note2">2</a></span> though no autopsy was performed and that would be the only means of making an absolute determination as to cause.</div><div class="casepar">The insurance carrier twice requested an autopsy, but the employee's widow refused to allow it.</div><div class="casepar">A hearing was held before the board for determining whether the matter was compensable. In the findings and award of the full board it is asserted that "the evidence is insufficient to show the cause of this accident and we are unable to determine whether deceased's accident was triggered by illness, falling to sleep, or some mechanical defect in the vehicle, and we conclude that his death was caused by an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment and is therefore compensable."</div><div class="casepar">abrasions on the forehead. Q. Are you stating that he did not die of an injury? A. No, I'm not stating that he did. not die of an injury. It is possible that he could have died from an maternal injury, but the nature of the injury was such that I could not determine that from the examination performed. Q. Is it your determination, then, that you cannot professionally determine his cause of death? A. That is correct . . . I made no X-Rays and performed no autopsy. Q. Doctor, in the absence of any findings of. physical injury and in a man in the late forties and early fifty age group, do you find the most likely cause of death is a heart attack or stroke? A. I will say that the most likely cause of death would be heart attack, not a stroke."</div><div class="casepar">The board then by a two-member ruling, one member dissenting, proceeded to find that the matter "was defended without reasonable grounds" and assessed attorney fees against the insurer, one member dissenting as to this.</div><div class="casepar">On appeal to the superior court the award was affirmed, but the court declined to assess further attorney fees for the appeal which were sought on the ground that the appeal was frivolous and unfounded.</div><div class="casepar">On appeal to this court the enumerations of error deal only with the attorney fees assessed by the board. Held:</div><div class="casepar">While the matter of whether the employer of the insured has defended a claim without reasonable grounds and is thus liable for attorney fees under Code Ann.  114-712 is a factual issue fUr determination by the board, Meeks v.

"Findings of fact on which the award in a workmen's compensation case is based must be supported by testimony. Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Chambers, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../719/19/index.html">84 Ga. App. 295 (66 SE2d 196)</a></span>." Aetna Ins. Co. v. Jones, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../611/46/index.html">125 Ga.

In this connection see Travelers Ins. Co. v. Maddox, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../634/21/index.html">118 Ga. App. 596 (164 SE2d 850)</a></span>; Brown Transport Co. v.

It is not necessary that the defense presented be such that the award may deny compensation.

Sheppard, <span class="casemissing">85 Ga. 751</span>, 815 (<span class="casemissing">12 SE 18</span>).</div><div class="casepar">We think the opinions of the doctors who testified disclose that reasonable grounds for defending the matter did exist and were presented. While, in view of other evidence presented by the claimant, it may very well be that the award of compensation was authorized, it was not demanded. The board did not accept the defense made and awarded compensation, but it was not an unreasonable or unfounded defense.</div><div class="casepar">Attorney fees may not be awarded where the matter was closely contested on reasonable grounds.

App. 76</a></span>, 79 (3) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../656/19/index.html">137 SE2d 749</a></span>).</div><div class="casepar">The finding of the board that the defense was made without reasonable grounds is without evidence to support it, is error, and that portion of the judgment affirming the award of attorney fees is reversed.</div><div class="casepar">This case arose out of the death of William F. Peck (employee), claimant's deceased husband, who was employed by Gainesville Machine Company (employer). Pacific Employers Insurance Company (insurer) provided the employer's workmen's compensation insurance coverage. A rather complete review of the facts surrounding the employee's death is necessary for complete understanding of the case.</div><div class="casepar">The employee was regularly employed as a truck driver. On this particular occasion, he was instructed by his immediate superior to drive a 1969 ton and a half Chevrolet flat bed, single axle truck to deliver certain poultry equipment to Decatur, Arkansas, a trip of 800 miles from the employer's place of business in Gainesville, Georgia. The trip commenced on July 8, 1971 at approximately 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon. On July 10, 1971, at 7:00 a.m., the employee delivered the poultry equipment to its destination at Peterson Industries Poultry Plant in Decatur, Arkansas. The employee did not assist in the unloading, but, after the same was accomplished, departed to return to Gainesville, Georgia at approximately 8:30 a.m. On the return trip, at approximately 3:00 p.m. on July 10, while traveling east on U. S. Highway 72 at a point over 400 miles east of Decatur, Arkansas and about 2 miles west of Iuka, Mississippi, on a "straight piece of road," the truck driven by the employee was seen leaving the road's south side (right side for eastbound traffic). The truck then traveled up an embankment, came down the embankment, and across the highway to a point 10 feet off the highway down an embankment on the north side thereof (left side for eastbound traffic). Witnesses arriving at the scene immediately thereafter found the employee lying on his right side on the seat with his feet back toward the steering wheel; and observed that he was struggling, gasping for breath, had small blue spots on the left side of his face, did not have his right color, and had a small laceration on his forehead. This condition continued for 8 to 10 minutes, then he stopped breathing. He was not breathing when the ambulance arrived and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</div><div class="casepar">The medical doctor at the hospital testified that he conducted a superficial examination of the then deceased employee and did not find any evidence of injury severe enough to have caused his death; that there were some superficial abrasions on the forehead; that he was not stating that the deceased did not die of any inquiry; that it is possible that the deceased could have died from an internal injury; that he could not determine the cause of death because no autopsy was performed (deceased was embalmed in Mississippi and returned to Gainesville for burial); that he did not determine from his examination if the deceased had a broken neck; that, in the absence of any physical findings of injury, the most likely cause of death of a man in his late forties (as was the employee) would be a heart attack; that there were no findings on his examination that the deceased may have died of a heart attack--an autopsy would be required; and that he did not examine the employee's arms and legs.</div><div class="casepar">Another medical doctor, a pathologist, on hypothetical question testified that the employee most likely died of an acute myocardial infarction if the doctor found no external causes of death; that his answer was premised on the fact that the employee died unexpectedly and for no apparent reason; that, if there was evidence of bruising to the front of the head and lacerations to the back of the neck, this would indicate that the employee could have died from injuries; that the possibility exists that excitement, fear, or excessive stimulations would and could precipitate an acute heart attack; that it is possible to have a broken neck without extensive damage to the head; that he could not say whether employee died of natural or accidental causes.</div><div class="casepar">Examination of the truck being driven by the employee, revealed that the front axle was bent under, the frame was bent, the windshield had been knocked out, the cab was warped, and there was "quite a bit" of frame damage. Repairs were estimated to cost between $2,000 and $2,500.</div><div class="casepar">Other evidence showed that the employee was 49 years of age; was a tall, thin man who had no prior history of a heart condition; that in addition to the injuries previously described, the employee's body showed bruises on the lower back of his head and the chest, a 3 to 5-inch laceration on the back of the head, abrasions of both legs, "a place on the right side of his head. . . a bruise on his arm, . . . a hole in his head." After burial, the employer/insurer requested the claimant/widow to allow an autopsy to be performed on the employee/decedent, which was refused.</div><div class="casepar">The deputy director found that "the evidence is insufficient to show the cause of this accident and I am unable to determine whether the deceased's accident was triggered by illness, felling asleep, or some mechanical defect in the vehicle, and I conclude that his death was caused by an accident and injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and is therefore compensable." The deputy director went on to find the existence of an issuable defense, but awarded compensation to the widow/claimant.</div><div class="casepar">The State Board of Workmen's Compensation approved the claimant's attorney fee contract (33 1/3% contingency).</div><div class="casepar">Employer/insurer appealed the award to the State Board of Workmen's Compensation, requesting a de novo review. The claimant thereafter petitioned the board to penalize the employer/insurer by the assessment of attorney fees and costs against them under the provisions of Code Ann.  114-712. Upon review, the full board unanimously affirmed the award of the deputy director as to compensation and found (2 to 1) that "this matter was defended without reasonable grounds" and ordered reasonable attorney fees assessed against the employer/insurer. The employer/insurer appealed to the Superior Court of Hall County, which affirmed the award in to to, but declined to assess any additional attorney fees. The appeal to this court is from the award of attorney fees only.</div><div class="casepar">In my opinion, the facts demand a finding that the employee's death was compensable and that the defense of the claim was unreasonable. It is well settled that where an employee is found dead at the place where he might be expected to be in the performance of the duties of his employment, the natural presumption arises that his death arose out of an accident in the course of his employment. For an excellent discussion of this point see New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Sumrell, <span class="casemissing">30 Ga. App. 682</span> (2a, b) (<span class="casemissing">118 SE 786</span>). See also Standard Accident Ins. Co. v. Kiker, <span class="casemissing">45 Ga. App. 706 (5) (165 SE 850)</span>; Williams v. Gartrell, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../614/15/index.html">124 Ga. App. 391 (184 SE2d 49)</a></span>. After this is shown, the burden is on the employer to show otherwise. American Surety Co. v. Castleberry, <span class="casemissing">57 Ga. App. 402</span>, 403 (<span class="casemissing">195 SE 590</span>).</div><div class="casepar">That the deceased employee met the foregoing requirement, has never been questioned in this case. What then is the basis for the defense of the claim? The employer/insurer contend that the employee died of a heart attack, yet there was no proof of this contention. At most, the two physicians that testified stated that the employee could have died of a heart attack, or, based on certain hypothetical facts, that in their opinion he probably died of a heart attack. Both doctors testified that they did not know the cause of the claimant's death. This is obviously not sufficient to even establish that the employee died of a heart attack, much less overcome the presumption that the death arose out of his employment. The facts in the instant case indisputably show that, within a 48-hour period in July, 1971, the employee had driven a 1-1/2 ton flat bed truck over 1,200 miles. This court knows from human experience that a trip of such length is tiring, particularly in July in the southern part of this country. Even if it had been conclusively proved that the employee died of a heart attack, after such a trip we most certainly could not say as a matter of law that. this did not contribute to his condition and that an award of compensation would not be authorized. The employer/insurer must take the case as it is, not as they might wish it to be. Here, there was positive proof of a violent accident immediately preceding the employee's death which had been preceded by a long, strenuous trip involving an employee who was in the performance of his employer's business at a place where he could be expected to be.</div><div class="casepar">I agree with the majority opinion that the issue of assessment of attorney fees is one of fact for determination by the board and that the finding of fact that the claim was defended without reasonable grounds, must be supported by evidence. The evidence heretofore recited in some detail, amply meets these requisites. The award is not subject to the criticism of being based on speculation. It is not sound to justify the employer/insurer's position on the mere possibility of a heart attack being the cause of the employee's death under the facts in this case, or the claimant/widow's refusal to authorize the exhuming of her husband's body for an autopsy (which she was under no compulsion to follow.

      Dr. Kelly S. Segars, who examined the deceased shortly after the fatal injury testified: "Q. Doctor, on your examination of Mr. Peck, did you find evidence that Mr. Peck died of any physical injury? A. I conducted a superficial examination and did not find any evidence of an injury severe enough to have caused his death . . . Q. What examination did you perform? A. Head, neck and chest. Q. Did you find any marks on the body in that area? A. As I recall, there is nothing in the record, there was (sic) some superficial</div><div class="casepar"><span class="casenotenum"><a name="note2" href="#source2">2</a></span>&nbsp;
      Dr. John T. Godwin, testifying as an expert, on being asked a hypothetical question as to his opinion of the cause of death, the known facts concerning the circumstances of the fatal injury being given: "Q. All right, doctor, if you have an opinion as to the most probable cause of death, would you state what that opinion is? A. Well, there are several reasons why one may die unexpectedly and suddenly as this man did, and assuming as you have indicated that the physician did not find evidence of an external injury, then the most likely cause of death would be an acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary occlusion. There are other conditions which may produce the same type of sudden unexpected death, such as pulmonary embolus, a ruptured aneurysm, either within the thorax or the brain, or cerebral hemorrhage is not her example, but generally an acute coronary occlusion would be the first consideration. Q. Is that what we laymen know as a heart attack? A. Yes . . .(After some cross examination) Q. So as a matter of fact, based upon what we've said here today, is it your opinion or is it not your opinion that Mr. Peck either died from injuries received in the wreck or from natural causes? A. I would have to have more evidence to conclude that this was due to injury.</div></div></td></tr><tr><td class="casefoot"><div class="casecounsel"><div class="caselawyer">Greer, Sartain &amp; Carey, Jack M.
