Before Judge Forrester.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="casebody"><div class="casepar">This is a death penalty case. Appellant, Johnnie B. Childs, was indicted in Wilcox County on two counts of murder and one count each of burglary, rape, kidnapping with bodily injury, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and escape. Childs pled guilty to the latter two counts, and was convicted by a jury on all of the remaining counts. He was sentenced to death for each of the murders. <span class="casenotenum"><a name="source1" href="#note1">1</a></span></div><div class="casepar">Facts</div><div class="casepar">Childs married Sharon Hill Childs on February 28, 1984. Sometime in late September or early October of that year, the wife left the defendant and moved in with her mother.</div><div class="casepar">The defendant tried unsuccessfully to persuade his wife to return to him. However, after talking to her by telephone on the evening of October 25, 1984, the defendant "made up" his mind that he was going to kill his wife and James Earl Bailey, whom Childs suspected of having an affair with his wife.</div><div class="casepar">Childs appeared at Sharon's mother's house, and, when Sharon answered the door, took her by her arm and put her into his car. They drove around for a few minutes, and, on his urging, she agreed to return to him. However, because she needed some clothes from her mother's house, they returned there. He waited outside, and Sharon entered the house and locked the doors. (Her mother was not at home.)</div><div class="casepar">Childs took a pair of pliers from his car and pried the screen off one of the windows of the house. He climbed inside, caught Sharon, and forced her back into his car.</div><div class="casepar">Childs drove outside of town to an isolated area. He stated that he put his gun on the "back floorboard" and they "made love" on the back seat of the car. Afterwards, they exited the car, and he shot her as she pleaded, "Don't do it, don't do it."</div><div class="casepar">Childs stated: "I shot her in the arm or shoulder the first time . . . [She] spun around holding her shoulder and I shot her in the head while she was facing me . . . When she fell, I walked around her and shot her in the leg. Then I walked back around her and shot her in the head again."</div><div class="casepar">Childs reloaded his pistol, lit a cigarette, and returned to town. He went to the Half Moon Cafe, where he had shot and killed a man seven years earlier, and observed James Earl Bailey seated outside, in the company of two other men. Childs pulled out his gun and fired at Bailey. The first shot missed, but the next two did not. He shot Bailey once more in the head, as Bailey lay on the ground. Childs told a bystander, "I just did what I wanted to do."</div><div class="casepar">Enumerations of Error</div><div class="casepar">1. First, Childs argues that the trial court should have granted his motion for severance.</div><div class="casepar">The crimes charged here were not of such an unrelated character as to entitle Childs to a severance as a matter of right. See Gober v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../777/1/index.html">247 Ga. 652 (1) (278 SE2d 386) (1981)</a></span>. Rather, the question of severance here addressed itself to the trial court's sound exercise of discretion.</div><div class="casepar">The two murders, the rape, the kidnapping with bodily injury, and the burglary were all such integral parts of the defendant's conduct on October 26, 1984, that the state hardly could have presented a case on any of the crimes without presenting evidence of the other crimes. The court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order these charges tried separately.</div><div class="casepar">The denial of severance did not force Childs to plead guilty to avoid the introduction of evidence of escape and of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Evidence that the defendant escaped from the Wilcox County jail while being held on the other charges in this case would have been admissible whether or not a severance was granted as to this offense, see Quick v. State, <span class="casemissing">256 Ga. 780 (5) (353 SE2d 497) (1987)</span>, and an appropriate procedure for trying a possession-of-a-firearm count is set forth in Head v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../618/9/index.html">253 Ga. 429 (322 SE2d 228) (1984)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">2. Second, Childs contends that his motion for change of venue should have been granted. We disagree. Of 95 prospective jurors who underwent a voir dire examination, 48 were excused for cause. However, less than half of these 48 prospective jurors (and less than a fourth of the total) were excused as a result of publicity-related bias, prejudice, or fixed opinion. Most were excused because of their attitudes for or against the death penalty, or for physical reasons. The jury selection process does not show actual prejudice to a degree that rendered a fair trial impossible, and Childs has not shown otherwise that the trial setting was inherently prejudicial. See Chancey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../544/7/index.html">256 Ga. 415 (5) (349 SE2d 717) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">3. After Childs shot James Earl Bailey, he drove to the police station to surrender himself. Police Chief Ray Bloodsworth was the only police officer on duty, and because he had been called to the Half Moon Cafe to respond to the reported shooting, the station was empty. The defendant stated: "I walked back to where the ambulance service was. I saw . . . Annie Ruth . . . back there . . . I told [her] that I had come for the police to lock me up because I had just killed somebody. Annie Ruth told me to go on and get out of there, that I was crazy. She said I hadn't killed anybody. I walked in the [city] clerk's office and asked a woman in there where was the police. I told her I had killed two people. She called [Chief Bloodsworth] on the radio . . . I told her I had some more bullets in my pocket and I took them out and gave them to her. The woman told me to wait there. I told her I wasn't going anywhere."</div><div class="casepar">The clerk for the City of Rochelle, Georgia, Jean Greene, testified that, although she was not a police officer and had no training as such, she did "have occasion," during the day, to dispatch the police to scenes of reported crimes. On this day, she dispatched Chief Bloodsworth to the Half Moon Cafe with information that someone had been shot. A few minutes later, Greene testified, Childs "came into the City Hall and told me that he was the one that done it . . . and I said, what? And he said, I'm the one that done it, and I said Oh, you are? And he said, Yeah." So she called Chief Bloodsworth and told him the person who had done the shooting was at the City Hall. Chief Bloodsworth told her to hold him.</div><div class="casepar">Childs heard the Chief tell Greene to hold him, and responded, "You hadn't got to hold me, I'm not going anywhere," and then, Greene testified, "he took out some bullets . . . put [them] on the counter and told me to go get the gun if I wanted it, it was in the car. So, after that I asked him, I -- I thought that he was probably -- that there had been an accident since he had come in and turned himself in, and I asked him what happened . . . And he said I just done what I wanted to do . . . Now I'll go back where I came from. And so I started to ask him where he had came from and then I happened to -- I said, have you been in prison? And he said, Yeah. And I said, What were you in prison for. He said, shooting a man, said, Now I've got two more." Greene testified that she asked Childs whom he had shot, because she had not known until then that a second person had been shot. Childs told her that Sharon was "laying [sic] out there in the woods close to Newt Hudson's dead," and that he had killed her.</div><div class="casepar">Greene testified that she was about 5' 4" was not armed, did not attempt to handcuff the defendant, and would not have tried to stop him if he had tried to leave.</div><div class="casepar">(a) In his fourth enumeration of error, Childs argues that his statements to the city clerk were elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (86 SC 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), and, on his objection, should have been excluded.</div><div class="casepar">We do not agree. The standards of Miranda come into play when the defendant is subjected to custodial interrogation by law enforcement officers. See Ross v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../582/2/index.html">254 Ga. 22</a></span>, 26-27 (fn. 5) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../582/2/index.html">326 SE2d 194</a></span>) (1985).</div><div class="casepar">Moreover, Ms. Greene took no overt action to detain the defendant (and would not have done so). The issue of custody involves an objective standard: Would a reasonable person in the defendant's situation have believed that he was physically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way? If not, he is not subject to the compulsive atmosphere of an actual arrest, and Miranda does not apply. See People v. Lopez, 163 Cal. App. 3d 602, 608-609, 209 Cal. Rptr. 575 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985).</div><div class="casepar">In the circumstances of this case, Childs could not have believed reasonably that an unarmed, non-uniformed city clerk was a law enforcement officer, or that he was in her custody. See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (III) (104 SC 3138, 82 LE2d 317) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">(b) Childs additionally argues that Greene's testimony violated OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/210/index.html">17-7-210</a></span>, because the state failed to furnish Child's statements to the defense at least 10 days prior to trial. However, Greene testified to no statements given by the defendant "while in police custody," and OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/17/7/210/index.html">17-7-210</a></span> therefore does not apply.</div><div class="casepar">(c) Finally, Childs argues here, and in his 16th enumeration of error, that the statements should not have been admitted because the references to his prior conviction were irrelevant and prejudicial.</div><div class="casepar">Unless the defendant himself decides to make it so, his character is not an issue at the guilt-innocence phase of a trial. However, evidence otherwise relevant is not inadmissible simply because it reflects adversely upon his character. Felker v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">252 Ga. 351</a></span>, 365 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../641/8/index.html">314 SE2d 621</a></span>) (1984).</div><div class="casepar">Here, as in Robinson v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../802/7/index.html">246 Ga. 469 (2) (271 SE2d 786) (1980)</a></span>, the defendant's statement referring to a previous killing tended to establish his motive for committing the killing, and, as well, to explain his state of mind at the time of the commission of the offense.</div><div class="casepar">We find no impermissible injection of character evidence.</div><div class="casepar">4. When Chief Bloodsworth arrived at the city hall, Childs told him the gun he used was on the front seat of his car. Chief Bloodsworth looked into the car, observed a gun lying on the front seat, and seized it.</div><div class="casepar">Childs argues that because the discovery of the gun was not "inadvertent," its seizure was not justified under the "plain view doctrine." See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (91 SC 2022, 29 LE2d 564) (1971). "But the case sub judice does not involve the 'plain view doctrine' insofar as that concept involves the premise of an initial intrusion." Speight v. State, <span class="casemissing">159 Ga. App. 5</span>, 7 (<span class="casemissing">282 SE2d 651</span>) (1981). Here, what the officer saw in "plain view" from outside the defendant's automobile corroborated what the defendant had told him, and justified the intrusion into the automobile, and the seizure of the gun. Speight v. State, supra. See also Catchings v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../536/8/index.html">256 Ga. 241 (4) (247 SE2d 572) (1986)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">5. In his 5th and 6th enumerations, Childs complains of the trial court's refusal to grant him funds for an independent defense psychiatrist. He contends that he established his entitlement to a psychiatrist under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. ---- (105 SC 1087, 84 LE2d 53) (1985), and that the lack of such assistance deprived him of a reliable determination of guilt, of sentence, and of his mental capacity to waive his Miranda rights.</div><div class="casepar">Childs offered testimony that, shortly after his arrest, he was seen dancing in his cell while listening to a loud radio, and that after he learned the state was seeking the death penalty against him, he cut his wrist. The sheriff testified that the cut was not very deep and required no stitches; that it "wasn't the kind of cutting that you could die from or be seriously injured from."</div><div class="casepar">On February 27, 1985 (after he cut his wrist) Childs was evaluated by Dr. Jerold S. Lower, Ph.D., J.D., at the Wilcox County Jail. His report, in pertinent part, states as follows:</div><div class="casepar">"Throughout our contact with him, Mr. Childs was alert, cooperative, and in good contact with reality. His conversation was clear, logical, coherent, and relevant. He was able to give a coherent account of the events which led to his arrest.</div><div class="casepar">"Mr. Childs is well aware of the nature of his charges, the possible penalties, the pleas and strategies open to him, the mechanics of the proceedings he faces in the courtroom, and the behavior which will be required of him in the situation. We see no reason why he cannot participate in his trial and in the preparation of his defense.</div><div class="casepar">"Mr. Childs displays an intellectual endowment which is distinctly below average. Test scores would place his functioning at approximately the junction between the borderline range and the mildly retarded range of intelligence. However, we know of no evidence that he has any particular deficits in his day-to-day adaptive functioning and therefore we would decline to diagnose mental retardation. It is likely that his test scores are somewhat depressed by a poor educational and cultural background. In addition, he displays signs of a personality disorder characterized by impulsive behavior, disregard for social mores, poor tolerance for frustration, and the like. He also reports a history of substance abuse.</div><div class="casepar">"Despite the above conditions, Mr. Childs does not display signs of a mental illness which would interfere with his ability to distinguish right from wrong, with respect to the acts charged, nor is there evidence of delusional compulsion. The only factor of which we are aware, which would have interfered with his ability to appreciate the criminality of the alleged conduct, was his self-reported ingestion of several unprescribed substances shortly before the alleged crimes. From a psychiatric point of view we have no particular recommendations for disposition."</div><div class="casepar">A capital defendant must be provided psychiatric assistance if he can show that insanity will be a significant issue at trial. Ake v. Oklahoma, supra; Lindsey v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../594/3/index.html">254 Ga. 444 (330 SE2d 563) (1985)</a></span>.</div><div class="casepar">The circumstances presented to the trial court did not establish that insanity would be a significant issue at trial. The court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to provide funds for psychiatric assistance. We note that a correctional psychologist testified on behalf of the defendant at the sentencing phase of the trial, on the issue of the defendant's future dangerousness. (He testified that, although Childs could not function in a non-violent manner in the community, "in the prison system he is not a problem.")</div><div class="casepar">The defendant's lack of an independent psychiatrist did not impair the hearing on the question of the voluntariness of the confession. Sinns v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../734/3/index.html">248 Ga. 385 (283 SE2d 479) (1981)</a></span>. See also Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. ---- (107 SC 515, 93 LE2d 473) (1986).</div><div class="casepar">6. In his 7th and 8th enumerations, Childs contends the trial judge improperly restricted the jury voir dire, and asked too many questions himself. We note that the voir dire proceedings fill almost 1200 pages of the trial transcript -- twice as many as the trial itself (guilt and sentencing phases combined). "While some of the questions excluded by the trial court, if minutely parsed and rigorously analyzed, arguably could have been allowed, nonetheless, the questions that were allowed were more than ample to allow the discovery of bias, prejudice and prior opinion." Curry v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../566/3/index.html">255 Ga. 215</a></span>, 218 (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../566/3/index.html">336 SE2d 762</a></span>) (1985). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's conduct of the jury voir dire.</div><div class="casepar">7. In his 9th enumeration, Childs contends the trial court erred by failing to excuse for cause 18 prospective jurors who were biased in favor of the death penalty. See Pope v. State, <span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/9/index.html">256 Ga. 195</a></span> (7e) (<span class="casecite"><a href="../../535/9/index.html">345 SE2d 831</a></span>) (1986). Of these 18 prospective jurors, 10 were not challenged for cause by the defense, and the challenge to another was only on physical grounds (the juror was hard of hearing). The trial court did not err by failing to excuse these 11 prospective jurors, sua sponte, for bias in favor of capital punishment.</div><div class="casepar">The trial court overruled the defendant's challenges to the remaining seven, finding they were qualified jurors under the standard of Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. ---- (105 SC 844, 83 LE2d 841) (1985).</div><div class="casepar">The trial court recognized that an inability fairly to consider a life sentence is just as disqualifying as an inability fairly to consider a death sentence. The court excused two jurors biased in favor of the death sentence. In contrast to the situation in Pope v. State, supra, the court's findings in this case are "within the deference due the trial judge's determination." Jefferson v.

Next, Childs argues that the trial court should have excused all jurors who admitted having formed and expressed an opinion regarding the guilt or innocence of the accused, whether or not the opinion was fixed, and whether or not the court felt the juror could lay aside his opinion and decide the issues upon the evidence presented at trial.</div><div class="casepar">As the defendant notes, OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/15/12/164/index.html">15-12-164</a></span> provides: "(a) On voir dire examination in a felony trial, the jurors shall be asked the following questions [including]: (1) 'Have you, for any reason, formed and expressed any opinion in regard to the guilt or innocence of the accused?'

Notwithstanding a 1979 statutory change to the wording of the question, see Ga.

In his 11th enumeration, the defendant contends the trial court erred by overruling his challenge to a prospective juror who testified that he belonged to an organization that did not admit blacks and that he did not believe in interracial religious worship. He testified, however, that a "person is innocent until he is proven guilty regardless of race . . . And according to the evidence presented to me, providing that I am selected as a juror, that . . . will be what I base my decision on."</div><div class="casepar">The trial court stated: "The court feels that he will be fair-minded and impartial and that he's just an exceptional, conscientious person. That's the impression the court has, and I'm going to leave him on the panel." We find no error.</div><div class="casepar">10. In his final attack on the jury selection proceedings, Childs complains (1) that his "carefully planned" strategy regarding the use of his peremptory challenges was disrupted when the court waited until after the jury was selected to excuse a juror whose wife was ill, and (2) that the jury was not composed of 12 impartial jurors because two of them were married to each other.</div><div class="casepar">The juror whose wife was ill had stated during voir dire that arrangements could be made to take care of his wife. However, his planned arrangement was that his daughter-in-law would take care of his wife, and this plan was upset when his daughter-in-law was also selected as a juror in this case.</div><div class="casepar">The circumstances here do not establish reversible error. Rather, they illustrate, once again, the necessity for adequate alternate jurors.</div><div class="casepar">As for the presence on the jury of a husband and wife, Childs cites no authority for his assertion that a juror is not impartial simply because the juror's spouse also is on the jury.

He also complains of Chief Bloodsworth's testimony that the defendant was on parole. Chief Bloodsworth was attempting to describe his intercession between Childs and his wife during a heated dispute a week prior to her death, and he testified, among other things, that he warned the defendant "to let her go home, that he knew he was on parole and he would just get in trouble. . . ."</div><div class="casepar">The state was authorized to present evidence of previous difficulties between the defendant and the victim.

Any error in the unsolicited reference to parole by Chief Bloodsworth was rendered harmless by the trial court's curative instructions.</div><div class="casepar">15. In enumeration 17, the defendant claims the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for burglary, in that it does not show that he entered his wife's home intending to commit the felony of kidnapping.

The trial court charged the jury that "a person commits the offense of burglary when, without authority and with intent to commit a felony or theft therein, he enters the dwelling house of another or enters any other building or any room or any part thereof." Childs argued that the trial court erred by charging that the crime of burglary can be committed in more than one manner, i.e., with the intent "to commit a felony or theft therein," when the indictment charged, and the evidence showed, an entry "with intent to commit a felony [i.e., kidnapping] . . . therein." See OCGA  <span class="casecite"><a href="../../../../../code/ga/16/7/1/index.html">16-7-1</a></span> (defining the offense of burglary).</div><div class="casepar">It is "not usually cause for a new trial that an entire Code section is given . . . even though a part of the charge may be inapplicable under the facts in evidence."

If there is a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted the defendant of the commission of a crime in a manner not charged in the indictment, then the conviction is defective "because of a fatal variance between the proof at trial and the indictment returned by the grand jury."

After the charge of the court at the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, the court conducted a conference outside the presence of the jury, as contemplated by Rule III (A) (3) of the Unified Appeal Procedure.

Next, Childs contends the trial court improperly limited his presentation of mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial.</div><div class="casepar">(a) In the first instance, the defendant asked a former employee in the prison system, "Do you have any idea if [the defendant] was sentenced to time in prison what prison he would be sent to?" The state's objection to this question was sustained.
